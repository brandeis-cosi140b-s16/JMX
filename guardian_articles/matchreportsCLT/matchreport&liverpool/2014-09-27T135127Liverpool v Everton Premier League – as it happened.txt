Liverpool v Everton: Premier League – as it happened


Post-match musings from Chris Healy: “Liverpool have nobody to blame but themselves. Mario missed a great opportunity to put the Reds two up and then they just sat back and invited Everton to come at them. Credit to Jagielka, that will surely be a goal of the month contender. I’m off to get drunk!”
 
I’m not, I’ve another of these to do shortly. So that’s all until...oooh...90 minutes or so from now. Join Nick Miller for his Clockwatch in the meantime. Enjoy yourselves.
