Manchester City v Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League - as it happened | Scott Murray


Tottenham will point to referee Jon Moss pointing to the spot. Four times. But you can make a case for, if not necessarily agree with, pretty much every decision the referee made. Soft spot kicks and red cards, yes, but no egregious outrages. Sometimes teams just don’t get the breaks. Spurs didn’t today, though they were magnificent at times in attack. City were however much the better side, the world-class Sergio Aguero scoring four goals. Four goals. A much-deserved win, though expect the post-match press conferences, and no doubt some online chat, to be lively. You can’t knock another five-goal thriller, though. City and Spurs: delivering goalfests since 1909!
