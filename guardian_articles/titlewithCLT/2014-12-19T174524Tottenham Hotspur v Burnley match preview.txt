Tottenham Hotspur v Burnley: match preview


This is not the most glamorous fixture on Tottenham’s calendar but in the context of their season, its importance cannot be overstated. The club fired a positive vibe at White Hart Lane with the midweek League Cup win over Newcastle, as they had done in the league victory against Everton, but on too many occasions Spurs have stumbled at home against teams that are below them in the table. Burnley have found form but Tottenham know that a win is essential. David Hytner
