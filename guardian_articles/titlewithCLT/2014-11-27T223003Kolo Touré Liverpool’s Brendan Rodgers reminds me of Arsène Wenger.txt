Kolo Touré: Liverpool’s Brendan Rodgers reminds me of Arsène Wenger


Kolo Touré has compared Brendan Rodgers’ managerial style to that of Arsène Wenger and insisted the Liverpool manager needs time to adapt to the demands of Champions League football.
 
Liverpool have not won in five matches in November and were denied a morale-boosting victory over Ludogorets on Wednesday by an 88th-minute equaliser.
 
The Anfield club must beat Basel on 9 December to qualify for the knockout phase.
 
Rodgers has come under increasing pressure during the poor run but Touré believes Liverpool must show patience with a manager who reminds him of Wenger.
 
The former Arsenal defender said: “This time is difficult for everybody but we need to stick together and fight for this manager because he’s one of the best managers in the Premier League. He is young as a manager and this is the first time he has managed in the Champions League. He is learning.
 
“I see Wenger in him because he’s so intelligent. He knows how to speak to players and how to get the best out of them. Just look at what he’s done during a short time here. When he arrived Liverpool were doing badly. He came in and brought the club a long way up. Maintaining it is more difficult than first coming up there. I think he is learning definitely. This season is a learning process but he will get there.
 
“He’s a fair guy who is working hard and gives 100% every day. Like Arsène, he’s always there at training trying to improve things. His style of play is also similar. He always wants us to pass the ball and keep playing which is very important.”
