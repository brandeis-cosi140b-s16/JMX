Alexis Sánchez to miss Arsenal’s trip to Tottenham with hamstring injury


Alexis Sánchez has been ruled out of Saturday’s north London derby for Arsenal having failed to recover from a hamstring injury.
 
The news is a blow to Arsène Wenger as he prepares for the match at Tottenham Hotspur, with the Chilean forward in outstanding form this term. However, Danny Welbeck rejoins the squad having been out for a month with a thigh injury.
 
“The latest is that Alexis is not ready,” Wenger told the club’s website. “He is not far away, the Leicester game [at home next Tuesday] is a possibility. He is of course very difficult to keep quiet. He is training but it’s light training.”
 
Jack Wilshere, who faces being reprimanded by his manager after being pictured in a nightclub holding a shisha pipe, will return from a long-term ankle problem to resume training next week.
