Liverpool v Southampton: match preview


Southampton were one of only two visiting teams to win at Anfield last season but will be unrecognisable for Ronald Koeman’s first Premier League game in charge. The goalscorer in that 1-0 win, Dejan Lovren, joined the summer exodus from St Mary’s to Liverpool and is the only former Saint likely to start against his old club with Adam Lallana suffering from a knee injury and Rickie Lambert, who has scored against all his ex-teams, set for the substitutes’ bench.
