Mario Balotelli trains at Melwood before £16m Liverpool move


Mario Balotelli has taken part in a one-on-one conditioning session at Melwood to prepare the way for a £16m move to Liverpool from Milan.
 
The striker arrived at the training ground at 1pm on Monday, where he was greeted by fans who had been waiting in the rain. He was put through his paces by the club’s conditioning coach, Ryland Morgans, wearing Liverpool training gear.
 
The Italy striker has agreed to sign a three-year contract worth a basic £80,000-a-week, plus £40,000 in performance and behaviour incentives, following talks with Brendan Rodgers over the weekend.
 
Balotelli is expected to watch Liverpool play his former club Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Monday night.
