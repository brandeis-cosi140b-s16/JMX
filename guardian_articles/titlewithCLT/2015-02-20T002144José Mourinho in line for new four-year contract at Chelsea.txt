José Mourinho in line for new four-year contract at Chelsea


José Mourinho is likely to sign a new contract with Chelsea during the summer, according to a report in the Times.
 
The Portuguese manager signed a four-year deal upon returning to the club for a second spell in June 2013 and, with Chelsea are well-placed in the FA Cup and Champions League this season and competing in the Capital One Cup final in nine days’ time, there is said to be an appetite to extend his stay beyond 2017. A new four-year package is reported to be lined up for Mourinho, with discussions on the cards once the season is over.
 
Chelsea finished the 2013-14 season without winning any trophies, but are seven points clear of Manchester City at the top of the Premier League with 13 games to play and will take a vital away goal into their Champions League round of 16 second leg against Paris Saint-Germain on 11 March. Tottenham Hotspur will stand between them and a first League Cup win since 2007 on 1 March.
