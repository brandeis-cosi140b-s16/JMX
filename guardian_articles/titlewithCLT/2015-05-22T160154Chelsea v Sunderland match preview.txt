Chelsea v Sunderland: match preview


These sides have met their season’s objectives, which should transform Stamford Bridge into something of a celebration. Dick Advocaat’s achievement in retaining Sunderland’s top flight status should be lauded. José Mourinho, the manager of the season, would have preferred to have hoisted the silverware after the victory over Crystal Palace earlier this month but will still savour the moment as he flings more youngsters into the fray to gain experience. He pinpointed the 5-3 defeat at Tottenham on New Year’s Day as psychologically important for his team. They have not looked back since. Dominic Fifield
