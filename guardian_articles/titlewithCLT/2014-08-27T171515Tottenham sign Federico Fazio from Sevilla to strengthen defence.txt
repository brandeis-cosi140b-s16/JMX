Tottenham sign Federico Fazio from Sevilla to strengthen defence


Tottenham have signed the Argentinian defender Federico Fazio from Sevilla. The London club announced that the 27-year-old centre-half had agreed a four-year deal, following Michael Dawson’s move to Hull City on Tuesday.
 
Tottenham did not disclose the fee but are understood to have paid the £8m release clause in Fazio’s contract with Sevilla. He will provide added competition at centre-back, where Spurs also have Jan Vertonghen, Younès Kaboul, Eric Dier and Vlad Chiriches.
 
Fazio has played two games for Argentina and has made 194 appearances for Sevilla since arriving there in 2007, winning the Copa del Rey, the Uefa Super Cup, the Spanish Super Cup and last season’s Europa League.
 
Fazio began his career in his native Argentina, playing for Ferro Carril Oeste.
 
Fazio joins Ben Davies, Dier and the goalkeeper Michel Vorm as defensive additions for Spurs this summer, with DeAndre Yedlin also being drafted in but loaned back to the Seattle Sounders.
