Chelsea v Stoke City: match preview


There may be no Diego Costa from the start against Stoke, but Chelsea will still aspire to move further clear at the top of the division with victory in Saturday’s late kick-off. Loïc Rémy’s winner at Hull City in their last fixture may end up as one of the campaign’s key goals. Stoke are safe and, despite having lost their last two games, will test the hosts’ resolve. “A difficult team,” said José Mourinho. An awkward, if not daunting, afternoon lies ahead for the leaders.
