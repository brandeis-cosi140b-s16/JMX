Aston Villa v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview


Tottenham travel to Villa Park desperate to make amends for their defeat by Newcastle last Sunday. A comfortable midweek win in the League Cup was scant consolation for surrendering a 1-0 lead at home to Alan Pardew’s strugglers. Aston Villa are on a five-game losing streak – but a win would lift them above Spurs and provide solace for their under-pressure manager, Paul Lambert. Toby Moses
