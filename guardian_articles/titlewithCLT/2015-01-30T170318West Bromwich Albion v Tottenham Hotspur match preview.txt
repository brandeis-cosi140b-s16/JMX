West Bromwich Albion v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview


One of Alan Irvine’s high points at The Hawthorns was victory at White Hart Lane in September, and completion of a league double would maintain Albion’s impressive form since Tony Pulis arrived. Pulis will want to avoid a repeat of last season’s meeting when the home side led Tottenham 3-0 only to draw. Spurs arrive just three points off 4th place, and will be buoyed by Wednesday’s testing League Cup semi-final win against Sheffield United. Charles Crook
