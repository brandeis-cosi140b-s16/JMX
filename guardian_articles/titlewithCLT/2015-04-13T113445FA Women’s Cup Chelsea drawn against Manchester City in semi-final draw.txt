FA Women’s Cup: Chelsea drawn against Manchester City in semi-final draw


Chelsea will face Manchester City in the semi-finals of the FA Women’s Cup, while last season’s beaten finalists Everton will play Notts County for the other spot in the 3 May final, which takes place at Wembley for the first time.
 
Chelsea, who overcame last year’s winners Arsenal in the quarter-finals, are the early pace-setters in the Women’s Super League after two wins from their opening two games. City lie second after a win and a draw.
 
In the second semi-final, Everton – the only former winners left in the competition – go against WSL 1 opposition in Notts County, who thrashed Aston Villa 5-1 in the last round.
