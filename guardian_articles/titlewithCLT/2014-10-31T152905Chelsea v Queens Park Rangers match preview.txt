Chelsea v Queens Park Rangers: match preview


José Mourinho delivered his warning towards the end of his briefing when it was suggested QPR would arrive at Stamford Bridge with few expectations of any reward. “Why?” he snapped back. “They did in the past. They did recently. Why shouldn’t they expect?” A west-London derby might, indeed, eke an away performance from Harry Redknapp’s team against the leaders. Diego Costa will return as Chelsea aim to avoid an upset. Dominic Fifield
