Chelsea midfielder Marko Marin joins Anderlecht on loan for rest of season


German midfielder Marko Marin has joined Belgian champions Anderlecht - his third loan spell since signing for Chelsea in 2012.
 
Marin, who has a contract at Stamford Bridge until 2017, spent the first half of the season on loan at Fiorentina having been at Sevilla last season. However the 25-year-old made no Serie A appearances and will now move to the Belgian Pro League for the remainder of the season.
 
The Germany international has made just six Premier League appearances for Chelsea since joining from Werder Bremen for £7m.
 
“RSC Anderlecht goes for quality and not quantity,” said Anderlecht’s general manager Herman Van Holsbeeck.
 
“The arrival of Marko Marin is a win-win situation for both parties. Here he can play at the highest level and help the purple and white achieve its ambitions.”
