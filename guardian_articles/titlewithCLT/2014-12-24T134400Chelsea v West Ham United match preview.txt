Chelsea v West Ham United: match preview


Chelsea’s response to that first defeat of the season, at Newcastle, has been immaculate, with Monday’s success at Stoke a fourth successive win in all competitions to ensure they remain clear at the summit. West Ham, in the top four at Christmas for the first time since 1985, will provide another stern test of the hosts’ title aspirations even if it is 12 years since the Hammers last triumphed down the District Line. With Arsenal to follow on the 28th, these next two derby fixtures will offer an indication of the strengths of Sam Allardyce’s side. Dominic Fifield
