Chelsea v Southampton: match preview


José Mourinho has been at pains to draw a line under Chelsea’s midweek elimination from Europe, with his players apparently fit, focused and eager to return to domestic matters where a Premier League title must be claimed. Efforts will be made to liberate Diego Costa and revive Cesc Fàbregas after recent stodgy form, and Southampton will arrive braced for a backlash and have been suffering themselves of late – even their much-needed 1-0 win over Crystal Palace was not fluent. Both these teams are in need of a performance. Dominic Fifield
