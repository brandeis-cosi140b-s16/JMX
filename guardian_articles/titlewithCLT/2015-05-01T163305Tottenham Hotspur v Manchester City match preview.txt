Tottenham Hotspur v Manchester City: match preview


This one has an end-of-season feel to it. City will not win the title but they will finish in the top four while Tottenham will surely not finish in the top four and nor are they are relishing the chase for Europa League qualification. The worry for Manuel Pellegrini is that there is also an end-of-era feel to it. The manager’s job prospects at City are uncertain while his ageing squad looks set for a summer reboot.
