Chelsea v Newcastle United: match preview


Chelsea were beaten 5-3 by Spurs on New Year’s Day and that could be bad news for Newcastle, who would be wise to prepare themselves for the backlash at Stamford Bridge. José Mourinho’s side were eight points clear of Manchester City in November, but are now top only on alphabetical order and they will be determined to quash any talk of them looking vulnerable. As for Newcastle, it is another chance for John Carver to throw his hat into the managerial ring. Jacob Steinberg
