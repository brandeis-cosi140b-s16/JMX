Tottenham Hotspur v Aston Villa: match preview


Will it be a triumphant return to White Hart Lane for Tim Sherwood? How he would love to get one over on his former club and show Tottenham Hotspur that they were wrong to sack him last summer, although it is not all about revenge for the Villa manager. His team are a mere three points above the bottom three and are winless in their past three matches. Yet putting an end to that worrying run will not be straightforward against Spurs, who have not completely given up hope of finishing in the top four. Jacob Steinberg
