Saturday Sundae: Liverpool fans in tuneful protest over ticket prices

MAN OF THE DAY 
Robin “very bad” van Persie was under pressure with Radamel Falcao back from injury. A fine goal and an assist later, he’s back in business.
 SHOCK OF THE DAY 
Arsenal making it through 23 minutes of live play before losing a player to injury. Nacho Monreal picked up his knock on 12 minutes but stuck it out for another 11.
 DING DONG OF THE DAY 
There were 51 attempts in the QPR v Leicester game – more than any Premier League game since 2006-07, when attempts data was first recorded.
 TEAM OF THE DAY 
Brentford earned a fifth straight win, beating Wolves 4-0. Stand by for a west London derby against Chelsea next season.
 PROTEST OF THE DAY 
Liverpool fans paraphrasing a favourite old Kop chant to make a point about rising ticket prices during their game against Stoke, with the day’s neatest banner: “Let me tell you a story of a poor boy … 1990 £4; 2000 £24; 2010 £43; 2020 ?”
 FANS OF THE DAY 
Credit to the 80 Dover Athletic fans who made the 700-mile round trip to Gateshead in the Conference. They saw their side, who arrived by plane, win 2-1.
 COLLAPSE OF THE DAY 
Bo’ness United held Arbroath to a 1-0 lead until the 68th minute in their Scottish Cup tie. Eight minutes later, it was 5-0.
 RESULT OF THE DAY 
Hyde, adrift in the Conference North, left their own official Twitter account swooning after winning their FA Trophy match 4-3 at Tamworth. @hydefclive: “OH MYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY”
