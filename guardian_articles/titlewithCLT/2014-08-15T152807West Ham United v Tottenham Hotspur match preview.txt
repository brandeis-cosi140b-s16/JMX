West Ham United v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview


West Ham beat Tottenham Hotspur three times last season and Mauricio Pochettino, the ninth manager Daniel Levy has appointed, will be desperate to stop them extending that run. Tottenham are likely to play on the unrest at Upton Park, where support for Sam Allardyce is at an all-time low. West Ham will be without the injured Andy Carroll, out with torn ankle ligaments until November, but have been boosted by the signing of Diafra Sakho from Metz. Jacob Steinberg
