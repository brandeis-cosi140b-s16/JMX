Steven Gerrard’s move to LA Galaxy from Liverpool set to be confirmed


Steven Gerrard’s move to LA Galaxy could be confirmed on Wednesday, with talks over the 34-year-old’s contract believed to be close to completion.
 
The Liverpool captain has not been given leave to travel to the United States to finalise the move, but all the necessary requirements associated with the 18-month deal are being completed in the UK.
 
He is expected to agree a basic salary of £4m per year, about £76,000 per week, with image rights inflating that figure. That equates to around half of what he is earning at Anfield.
 
The news comes after Gerrard admitted he would have signed a contract extension at Liverpool had it been offered to him last summer rather than in November, by which point Brendan Rodgers had made clear he would no longer be an automatic selection.
 
“If a contract had been put in front of me in pre-season I would have signed it,” Gerrard told the Liverpool Echo. “I’d just retired from England to concentrate all my efforts on Liverpool. I didn’t want my club games to be tailored.
 
“My injury record had been fantastic for the past two and a half years and I had a great season from a personal point of view last season. It’s all ifs, buts and hindsight now. That period between the summer and the end of November gave me thinking time.
 
“There’s no blame and I’m not angry about it. There are other people in the squad and the club had other things to worry about. Liverpool Football Club have been unbelievable for me since I was eight years old. This club has helped me fulfil my dreams over and over again.”
