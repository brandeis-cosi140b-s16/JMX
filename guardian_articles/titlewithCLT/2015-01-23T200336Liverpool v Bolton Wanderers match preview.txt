Liverpool v Bolton Wanderers: match preview


Bolton have progressed in six of eight FA Cup ties against Liverpool and any notion that a side 15th in the Championship cannot conjure a seventh success is undermined by Neil Lennon’s presence in the opposition dugout. The former Celtic manager has steered Wanderers away from the relegation zone since replacing Dougie Freedman in October through disciplined defending and by adding experience to the attack; 37-year-old Emile Heskey will be sure of a warm return to Liverpool, who are in confident mode.
