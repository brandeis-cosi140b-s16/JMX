Tottenham v West Bromwich: match preview


Alan Irvine will be desperate to get his first win of the season when West Brom travel to take on a lukewarm Tottenham. It has been 13 games since West Brom’s last Premier League victory and a staggering 30 years since their last win at White Hart Lane. Mauricio Pochettino will also want three points after Tottenham’s previous home game ended in a disappointing 3-0 defeat by Liverpool. Alex Cassidy
