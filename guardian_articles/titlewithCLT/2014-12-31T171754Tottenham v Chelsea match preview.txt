Tottenham v Chelsea: match preview


Tottenham’s 3-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge in early December led to much head-shaking among the Spurs faithful, with the general consensus being that a coveted top-four place was beyond them. Four wins and two draws since see them still in the mix and this looks a pivotal game. The league leaders dropped points at Southampton on Sunday and will want to regain momentum. Paul Chronnell
