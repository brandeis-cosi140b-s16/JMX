Crystal Palace v Liverpool: match preview


Liverpool’s last visit to Selhurst Park, back in November, arguably proved a watershed moment in this campaign with Brendan Rodgers reshaping his side in the wake of that thumping. There have been only two defeats in 21 matches in all competitions since, the sense that it is their destiny to claim this competition and give Steven Gerrard a proper send off growing with each round. The captain will be absent injured in the fifth round and this appears awkward. The Merseysiders have not won at Palace in six attempts and Alan Pardew’s presence will conjure memories of Villa Park in 1990. This is a test. Dominic Fifield
