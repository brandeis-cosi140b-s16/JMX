Liverpool v Chelsea: match preview


Brendan Rodgers claims to be under no extra pressure against Chelsea following that team selection against Real Madrid but scrutiny of his methods will intensify without a positive result against the unbeaten Premier League leaders. He is acutely aware of that. Liverpool’s display at the Bernabéu has been subject to Malcolm Tucker-esque spin since Tuesday, but the fact remains they require a vast improvement to inflict defeat on Chelsea, themselves in need of a jolt after their levels dropped against QPR and Maribor.
