Referee Chris Foy in spotlight for cards after Chelsea’s win over Hull


The referee Chris Foy is likely to come under scrutiny after handing out seven yellow cards in addition to a second-half red to Hull’s Tom Huddlestone during Chelsea’s 2-0 win at Stamford Bridge.
 
There could have been more cards had the officials spotted Mikel John Obi’s stamp on Sone Aluko in the buildup to Eden Hazard’s headed goal.
 
Hull’s Alex Bruce smashed through Willian but was only booked, the same punishment dished out to Diego Costa for diving soon afterwards, despite having clearly been caught by Huddlestone.
