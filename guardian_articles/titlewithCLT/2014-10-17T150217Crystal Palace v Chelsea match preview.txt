Crystal Palace v Chelsea: match preview


It was Chelsea’s inability to win matches of this kind last season which cost them a league title, Palace winning courtesy of a John Terry own goal back in the Spring to start a five-match winning run that took them to safety. José Mourinho will take a squad wounded by international efforts but steeled to avenge that first league loss to these local opponents in 24 years.Dominic Fifield
