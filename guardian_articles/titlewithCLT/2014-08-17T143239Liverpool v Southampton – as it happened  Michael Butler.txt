Liverpool v Southampton – as it happened | Michael Butler


Liverpool enjoyed 56% possession but in terms of chances, Southampton were well worth a point here. Davis, Schneiderlin and especially Long all had golden opportunities and without the goalkeeping of Mignolet, they surely would have got it. As was the case last season, Liverpool started strongly and when they were fleetingly in top gear, the Saints couldn’t live with them.
 
Rodgers will feel similar to Wenger – three points in the bag, but plenty to work on. What was encouraging was how quickly and effectively their style changed with the introduction of Lambert. Showed what a good plan B that is.
 
As for Koeman, he can take a lot from this game, but his best performers didn’t include his new signings Tadic and Pelle, who were wasteful and quiet respectively. Ward-Prowse seems to have been given more responsibility with the departure of Lallana, he showed again how much promise he has. 
 
Thanks for reading, and for your emails and tweets. Bye!
