Liverpool’s Asisat Oshoala wins BBC women’s footballer of the year award


Asisat Oshoala has won the BBC women’s footballer of the year award. The award, in its inaugural year, was voted for by BBC World Service listeners.
 
The Liverpool and Nigerian forward beat a shortlist which includedVerónica Boquete (Frankfurt/Spain), Nadine Kessler (Wolfsburg/Germany), Kim Little (Seattle Reign/Scotland) and Marta (Rosengard/Brazil).
 
Oshoala, who became the first African footballer in the Women’s Super League when she signed for Liverpool in January, won the Golden Boot and Golden Ball at last year’s Under-20 World Cup, where she scored seven goals in six matches. She is also a senior Nigeria international and her performances helped earn her country’s qualification for the World Cup which starts on 6 June.
 
She said: “I feel very happy and appreciated. It’s a very good thing for me and also motivation for the World Cup. It’s a really good thing for us as a team because we know we have something great and now we want to go at the trophy.
 
“I think there is going to be a lot of motivation for women’s football in Nigeria now because of the award and because there are a lot of fans out there. Support for women’s football in Nigeria is now growing very high.”
