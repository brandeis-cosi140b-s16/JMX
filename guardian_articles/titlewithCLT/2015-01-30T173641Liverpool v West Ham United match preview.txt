Liverpool v West Ham United: match preview


Liverpool can leapfrog Sam Allardyce’s team with victory at Anfield, where West Ham United have not won in the league since The Beatles were at number one with ‘She Loves You’ in September 1963. Stewart Downing and Andy Carroll have a point to prove against the manager who ended their Anfield careers, Brendan Rodgers, but his team have taken 14 points from a possible 18 since losing to Manchester United and have Daniel Sturridge back for the first time since August. Andy Hunter
