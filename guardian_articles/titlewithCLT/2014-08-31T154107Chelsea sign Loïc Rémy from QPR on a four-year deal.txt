Chelsea sign Loïc Rémy from QPR on a four-year deal


Chelsea have signed the QPR striker Loïc Rémy on a four-year deal. Chelsea triggered a £10.5m release clause in his contract on Saturday lunchtime and he was subsequently left out of their squad to face Sunderland.
 
“I feel very happy and very proud. When I heard Chelsea wanted to sign me I said ‘let’s go’ straight away because they are one of the best clubs in the world,” said Rémy. “I remember the amazing atmosphere at Stamford Bridge when I played there for Marseille and I can’t wait to play for the first time in front of my new fans.”
 
There were reports that Arsenal were also interested in signing the striker but decided not to pursue the deal any further.
 
Rémy joined QPR from Marseille in January 2013, scoring six goals in 14 games, as Rangers were relegated from the Premier League. He spent the 2013-14 campaign on loan at Newcastle United, where he scored 14 goals.
 
He played in QPR’s first two league games this season but not in their Capital One Cup defeat by Burton Albion, so remains eligible to play for Chelsea in all competitions. A deal to Liverpool earlier this summer fell through after it was thought that Rémy failed a medical.
