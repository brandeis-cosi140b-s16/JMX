Sunderland v Chelsea: match preview


Sunderland may appear in peril of reprising last season’s relegation skirmish but at least Gus Poyet knows how to beat José Mourinho. As a former Chelsea player, Poyet relished choreographing a 2-1 win at Stamford Bridge in April which ended Mourinho’s run of 77 undefeated home Premier League games during his two stints in charge in west London. As if that was not enough, Poyet’s players also knocked Chelsea out of last season’s League Cup. Can lightning strike thrice? “I’m hoping for an ugly evening with lots of wind and rain,” he says.
