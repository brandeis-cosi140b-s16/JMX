Chelsea hopeful Diego Costa will be fit to face Swansea on Saturday


Chelsea are cautiously optimistic they will have Diego Costa available for the top-of-the-table meeting with Swansea City when the Premier League resumes on Saturday despite the Spain striker having withdrawn from the squad for his country’s opening Euro 2016 qualifier against Macedonia on Monday evening.
 
Costa complained of discomfort in his left leg during last week’s friendly defeat to France at the Stade de France, pain that was apparently not associated with the minor damage sustained in training ahead of the recent win at Everton, and was assessed by the national association’s medical staff. He had a scan back in Madrid prior to being released from Vicente del Bosque’s squad, with the results of those tests having since been sent to Chelsea.
 
The London club have conducted their own examinations since the player returned to Cobham and while the Brazil-born forward has suffered recent niggles in his hamstrings, there is some optimism that this latest twinge is not serious.
 
He will continue to be assessed over the remainder of the week ahead of the visit of Swansea, when at least one of the sides, currently first and second in the fledgling table, will drop their first points of the season. That game is followed by Chelsea’s first Champions League fixture of term, against Schalke on Wednesday.
 
Costa has made an impressive start in England since joining from Atlético Madrid for £32m in the summer, scoring four goals in his first three league matches. Yet he was blighted by hamstring trouble towards the end of last season, reducing his impact in the Champions League final and run-in to Atlético’s successful pursuit of the Primera Liga. He was also clearly short of fitness at the summer’s World Cup finals.
