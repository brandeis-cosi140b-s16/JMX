Liverpool rebuilding application to be considered by city council


Liverpool’s proposed £75m rebuild of the main stand at Anfield will be considered by the city council next Tuesday when the planning officer will recommend the application is approved.
 
The 23 September meeting of the council’s planning committee represents another significant step in the saga of Anfield’s redevelopment and, following the publication of the planning officer’s report, Liverpool are cautiously optimistic of a favourable outcome.
 
Legal challenges and local opposition could still arise from the meeting and, even if approved there will be a further six-week consultation process before Liverpool can proceed with construction.
 
Liverpool’s application concerns both the Main Stand and the Anfield Road Stand although work will commence only on the former initially, increasing the stadium capacity by 8,500. The construction firm Carillion will carry out the work, which is scheduled to take 20 months and be completed in time for the start of the 2016-17 season.
