Football transfer rumours: Tottenham to sign Fabian Delph?


It is almost Christmas and West Ham are sticking their hand deep into their stocking. Down at the bottom is always the best bit: the tangerine. But lo, what else is there? Yes, it is Alex Song saying West Ham are the club of his dreams and he wants to stay there.
 
Sam Allardyce can do no wrong these days, it seems, and he has persuaded the Cameroon midfielder that he can see out his days with the Hammers. Or probably, West Ham are doing well, Song was asked a couple of questions by a French newspaper, he looked at the position in the league table and thought there was no point rocking the boat during his season-long loan from Barcelona. He says he wants Champions League action – my son, you are in the right place.
 
Over at Tottenham, Emmanuel Adebayor and Benoît Assou-Ekotto are heading out through the out door. Adebayor – once of Real Madrid, the Mill reminds you – will probably have to go out on loan as no one wants to take on his wages of £100,000 a week. Not even Real Madrid.
 
Spurs could swap bench-warming midfielder Mousa Dembélé with Aston Villa’s Fabian Delph. However, Mark Hughes, the Stoke manager, could jump in and take Dembélé to the Britannia Stadium. That may not be all that surprising, as Stoke make a late play for most entertaining team in the Premier League. Hughes signed the Belgium international when he was managing Fulham and Dembélé was very young and at AZ in Holland.
 
Everton are in the hunt for Curtis Davies, as the Hull captain has lost his first-team place. Davies scored for Hull in the FA Cup final in May and was named player of the year at the club but now the dream has died. He has 18 months left on his contract and is, as they say, considering his future.
