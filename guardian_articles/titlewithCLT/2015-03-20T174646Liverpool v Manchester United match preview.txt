Liverpool v Manchester United: match preview


The fierce rivalry will have an added edge at Anfield with both teams in pursuit of a top-four finish, possibly at the other’s expense, and Liverpool looking to avenge December’s 3-0 defeat at Old Trafford. That result left Brendan Rodgers’ team 10th in the table and 10 points behind United but their recovery has been outstanding, with 33 points taken from the last 39 available. Louis van Gaal’s men must maintain the impressive shown form against Spurs last Sunday or risk being overtaken. Andy Hunter
