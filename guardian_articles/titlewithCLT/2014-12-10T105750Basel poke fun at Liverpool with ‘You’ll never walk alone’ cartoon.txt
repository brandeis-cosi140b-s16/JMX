Basel poke fun at Liverpool with ‘You’ll never walk alone’ cartoon


Basel poked fun at Liverpool after knocking them out of the Champions League by posting a picture of a battered Red being held up by Spurs and Chelsea players and the two of them saying: “You’ll never walk alone.”
 
The Swiss dark horses were also referencing their two defeats of Chelsea last season and their Europa League victory over Tottenham in the 2012-13 competition.
 
Mystifyingly, Manchester United were spared mention of their 2-1 defeat to Basel in the Champions league in December 2011 which put them out of the competition.
       
 The 1-1 draw at Anfield means that Basel will enter Monday’s Champions league draw after finishing second to Real Madrid in the group while Liverpool drop into the Europa League.
 
Lest anyone take umbrage, along with their now-deleted cartoon on Instagram, to mitigate any offence Basel posted a sombre picture of the Shankly gates with the legend “You’ll never walk alone” across the top, while during the match their fans held up a banner demanding “Justice for the 96”.
