Everton v Chelsea: match preview


Roberto Martínez claimed his first league win as Everton manager against Chelsea, the victory arriving in the second home game of last season following three draws. After two draws so far, both a consequence of conceding late goals, he will be hoping for a repeat with the ex-Chelsea strikers Romelu Lukaku and Samuel Eto’o in his ranks but this is a far more potent and creative José Mourinho side than the one that arrived at Goodison Park for Eto’o’s debut 12 months ago.
