Kolo Touré admits Mario Balotelli has found life tough at Liverpool


Kolo Touré has admitted his Liverpool team-mate Mario Balotelli is going through a tough period at the club but said he is trying to help him through it.
 
Balotelli has yet to score a Premier League goal since moving to Anfield from Milan during the summer, and has found himself on the substitutes’ bench since returning from injury last month. Touré believes the Italian striker’s confidence has been affected by the goal drought, but has insisted he has the ability to come good.
 
“Balotelli is a world-class player but of course it has been a tough period for him,” Touré told the Swedish paper Aftonbladet. “I try to help him by talking to him, everyone knows he is a good player. Strikers need to score goals and when they don’t their confidence is affected. But as I said he is world class.”
 
Of Liverpool’s recent improvement in results, Touré said: “Everything is better now and I hope we can continue down that path. I think we have developed as a team [during the season].”
 
The Ivory Coast defender was speaking before his country’s friendly against Sweden in the buildup to the Africa Cup of Nations. He is targeting the trophy in what is likely to be his final major international tournament.
 
“We are here to win the Africa Cup of Nations and we have that possibility even if it is going to be tough,” said the former Arsenal and Manchester City player. “It is possibly my last chance [to win it] and I really want to grab that opportunity.”
