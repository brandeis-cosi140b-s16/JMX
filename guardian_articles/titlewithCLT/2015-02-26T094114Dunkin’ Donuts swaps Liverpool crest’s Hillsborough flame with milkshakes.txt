Dunkin’ Donuts swaps Liverpool crest’s Hillsborough flame with milkshakes


Dunkin’ Donuts, one of Liverpool’s official sponsors, has apologised after upsetting fans by tweeting an altered version of the club’s crest that replaced the Hillsborough eternal flames with what appeared to be milkshakes.
 
The company also substituted the Shankly Gates on the top of the crest with a picture of doughnuts and a coffee and instead of the legend: “You’ll never walk alone” they instituted the slogan: “America runs on Dunkin’”.
 
Their tweet, since taken down, read: “Love the LFC crest? Tweet us what you’d want on your personal crest and we might surprise you with your own!”
       
In a statement reported by the Liverpool Echo they said: “We apologise for any insensitivity regarding our tweet supporting an LFC-themed promotion featuring the LFC crest.
 
“As a proud partner of LFC, we did not intend any offence, particularly to the club’s supporters. We have removed the tweet and halted the campaign immediately.”
 
The eternal flames were added to the club badge in in 1993 as a tribute to the 96 people who died in the Hillsborough disaster four years previously.
 
Liverpool signed a multi-million pound deal with the American company in January 2014 when the club saluted “our official coffee, tea and bakery provider”.
