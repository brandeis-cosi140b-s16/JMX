Aston Villa v Chelsea: match preview


Ron Vlaar’s return from injury will boost an Aston Villa defence which conceded five at Arsenal on Sunday. Joe Cole may also feature as Paul Lambert’s side seek a first league goal since 20 December. Chelsea, five points clear at the top and with their next four games against teams in the bottom half, welcome back Cesc Fàbregas but Diego Costa is still missing through suspension. Rob Bleaney
