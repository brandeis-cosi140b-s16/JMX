Barcelona’s Luis Suárez claims he left Liverpool because of the English press


Barcelona’s Luis Suárez has claimed that he left Liverpool last summer because he felt mistreated by the English press.
 
The striker was a controversial figure during his time in England, and was criticised for his conduct in a number of incidents – namely his bite on Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic and the racism scandal with Patrice Evra.
 
Last month, the Uruguayan dismissed suggestions that he tried to bite Manchester City’s Martín Demichelis during Barcelona’s 2-1 Champions League win at the Etihad Stadium last month, in which the 28-year-old scored twice.
 
“They published images of me [next to Demichelis] in the morning and when they saw that that was false those images disappeared off the pages, he told BeIn Sports. “I said enough and that they leave me alone and that I went because I was tired of them, but yet they are still looking [for me].
 
“I don’t know if there is a campaign of the English press towards me, but it can be seen that they miss me. They criticise me so much that they look for something that is not there to draw attention.”
 
After his £75m move from Merseyside in July, Suárez made a sluggish start to his Barcelona career, taking eight league matches to score his first La Liga goal. Since then, he has performed impressively as part of a front three with Lionel Messi and Neymar and has found the net six times in his last four matches.
 
“I am very happy at Barça, I fulfilled a dream to play at the best club in the world and now I am enjoying it,” Suárez continued. “I am contributing things to the team and that leaves me calmer and makes me feel important.
 
“The family are very happy in Barcelona and enjoying a city that we knew. The children are in the school and my wife is very happy.”
