Liverpool’s Steven Gerrard: I’m not joining LA Galaxy for a holiday


Steven Gerrard has promised LA Galaxy supporters that he is not moving to MLS for a holiday and has admitted he wants to end his career with more silverware.
 
The Liverpool captain announced he would be leaving Anfield at the end of the season last week, with Galaxy subsequently confirmed as his destination.
 
“Their pursuit of me was very aggressive,” Gerrard told the Liverpool Echo.
 
“The talks I’ve had with them have been very positive. They basically told me what I wanted to hear – they told me about the winning mentality at the club and about their aims and goals for the future.
 
“It’s perfect timing for this new challenge in my life. I am really excited and looking forward to it.”

He added: “Football is my life and it will be continue to be so for another couple of years. I’m not going for a holiday or to enjoy myself, I’m going to win. I want to play my part and contribute to help bring more silverware to this team. I know I can perform well for the next couple of years.”
 
Gerrard is expected to make his debut for his new club on 17 July against San Jose. However, the club president Chris Klein told BBC Radio 5 live on Thursday that the prospect of loaning him back to Liverpool or any other European club when the regular MLS season finishes in October has “never been discussed”.
 
“In the summer Gerrard’s focus will be LA Galaxy,” he said.
