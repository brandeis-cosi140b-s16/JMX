Chelsea v Manchester City: match preview


José Mourinho has ‘empirical evidence’ that the world is against him. His star striker’s unwitting tread on the foot of an opponent has been ‘distorted’ into a stamping storm and suspension while the Chelsea manager himself is £25,000 lighter for having had the temerity to suggest that the world is indeed against him. He might be without not only Diego Costa but Cesc Fàbregas, who has a hamstring issue, against a City side who are having a wobble. Expect more fireworks. David Hytner
