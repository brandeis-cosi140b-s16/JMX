Arsenal and Tottenham inquire after Manchester City’s Matija Nastasic


Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur are interested in Matija Nastasic and both clubs have made an inquiry to Manchester City about the central defender.
 
The champions are minded to allow Nastasic to depart and would prefer to see the 21-year-old leave on a permanent basis, rather than a loan deal, as they look to recoup as much money as they can for the defender who cost them £12m in 2012.
 
With Arsenal being a perceived title rival, it may be that City would prefer for Nastasic to go to Tottenham.
