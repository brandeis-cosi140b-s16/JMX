Brendan Rodgers eager for Glen Johnson’s Liverpool deal to be extended


Brendan Rodgers has intervened in Glen Johnson’s contract stand-off with Liverpool to declare he wishes to keep the England defender at Anfield. The 30-year-old is a free agent this summer and eligible to sign a pre-contract agreement with a foreign club this month, having resisted Liverpool’s offer of a short-term extension on terms reduced from his £120,000-a-week wage.
 
Liverpool’s offer was made late last season but Johnson wanted a longer-term deal and said in November that he was “not going to go crawling to anybody”. An impasse remains between the two parties but Rodgers has hinted a resolution that once appeared highly unlikely could happen and urged Liverpool to extend the right-back’s six-year career at Anfield.
 
“There is nothing new as yet but I am hopeful he will stay and hopeful that we can find a solution and keep him here,” said Rodgers, who clarified he is not involved in contract negotiations at the club. “Ian [Ayre, the chief executive] does an excellent job negotiating with the owners for what they want and what they require,” he explained.
 
Rodgers admitted his cautious optimism that Johnson will stay is based on conversations he has held with the player. “Like every player, he wants that security and for it to be sorted earlier than it is now but he also realises he is at one of the biggest clubs in the world with a team that is growing. He would want to be a part of that. I think he is more than happy to work with the club to find a solution for him to stay. He loves being here.
 
“His game will maybe adapt over the coming years. He is not the marauding full-back of six, seven years ago but he is still a quality player with experience. He is one that we are looking to keep and, between the agent and the club, hopefully we can organise something.”
