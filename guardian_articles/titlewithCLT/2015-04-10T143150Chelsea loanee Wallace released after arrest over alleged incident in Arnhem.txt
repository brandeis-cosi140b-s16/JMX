Chelsea loanee Wallace released after arrest over alleged incident in Arnhem


The young Chelsea full-back Wallace Oliveira dos Santos has been released without charge by Dutch police having been arrested in the small hours of Friday morning over an alleged incident in Arnhem city centre.
 
The Brazil under-20 international, signed from Fluminense in 2013, is currently one of three Chelsea players on loan at Vitesse, who are fifth in the Eredivise. The 20-year-old had been detained by police at around 4am though, with no complaint filed against him, no charges were brought against the player who was duly released on Friday afternoon.
 
Wallace has, however, been fined the maximum possible by the Dutch club and dropped for Saturday’s game against Excelsior in Rotterdam for breaking Vitesse’s in-house rules having been out less than 48 hours before a league game. The player has featured 15 times this season, scoring once, with the Dutch club having indicated last month that they are not interested in retaining his services next season.
