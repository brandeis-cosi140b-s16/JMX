Harry Kane signs new five-and-a-half year contract with Tottenham


Harry Kane’s superb form for Tottenham this season has earned him a new five-and-a-half-year contract at White Hart Lane.
 
The 21-year-old only signed a new deal in August but his 20 goals in all competitions have earned him improved terms and a contract until 2020.
       
Kane’s goalscoring form in the cup competitions prompted the manager Mauricio Pochettino to give the academy graduate a run in the Premier League and he has not looked back, scoring 10 league goals, including doubles against Chelsea and, on Saturday, West Bromwich Albion.
