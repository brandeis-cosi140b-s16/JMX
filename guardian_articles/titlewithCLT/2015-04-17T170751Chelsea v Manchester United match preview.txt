Chelsea v Manchester United: match preview


Louis van Gaal’s side will arrive in south-west London in the best form of their campaign but with their defensive ranks severely depleted by injury and suspension. Phil Jones, Michael Carrick, Daley Blind, Marcos Rojo and Jonny Evans will all be absent, but there will be no sympathy from José Mourinho. “Their squad is amazing, in numbers, players, experience, solutions,” said the Portuguese, whose side can move 11 points clear of their visitors with victory. Chelsea, who will give a late check to Loïc Rémy, know a win will bring the title tantalisingly within reach. Dominic Fifield
