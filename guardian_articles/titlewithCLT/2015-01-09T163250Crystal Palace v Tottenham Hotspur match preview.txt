Crystal Palace v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview


Returning to league action for the first time since their exhilarating win over Chelsea, Tottenham will be confident of extending their seven-match unbeaten run but know they face a serious test in the form of a Palace side intent on embarking on a hot streak of their own under Alan Pardew. The question is a fresh approach and renewed optimism will be enough for Palace to compensate for the new manager’s chances are not helped by the absence of key duo Mile Jedinak and Yannick Bolasie, both of whom are away on international duty.
