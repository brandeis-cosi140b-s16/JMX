QPR v Tottenham: match preview


Chris Ramsey will take pride from seeing so many of the players he coached as youngsters now performing well in Tottenham’s senior team but will also hope that Ryan Mason, Danny Rose, Andros Townsend and Harry Kane have off-days at Loftus Road. The apparent revival of Aston Villa under Ramsey’s former colleague Tim Sherwood increases the difficulty of the task facing Queens Park Rangers as they try to escape relegation. Much could depend on which of the top flight’s leading English scorers gets the better service: Ramsey has Charlie Austin but Spurs will be confident Kane will prevail. Paul Doyle
