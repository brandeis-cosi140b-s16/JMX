West Bromwich Albion v Chelsea: match preview


Diego Costa could make his first appearance for Chelsea since 4 April after recovering from a hamstring injury. His replacements, Didier Drogba and Loïc Rémy, have managed just one goal between them during his absence – although this failed to stop José Mourinho’s side cruising to the title. Albion are safe from relegation and have only £1.2m per place Premier League prize money to play for. Rich Flower
