Cesc Fàbregas missing for Spain but should be fit for Chelsea


Chelsea are confident Cesc Fàbregas will be fit to start their next Premier League game, against West Bromwich Albion, despite the midfielder withdrawing from the Spain squad citing discomfort in his hamstring.
 
Fàbregas was called up by Vicente del Bosque for Saturday’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Belarus in Huelva and next Tuesday’s friendly against Germany in Vigo but indicated he had an injury. The Spanish football federation’s medical staff examined the 27-year-old in Madrid and, while there did not seem to be a serious problem, agreed to release the player back to Chelsea for treatment.
 
The midfielder had played the whole of Chelsea’s Premier League victory at Liverpool on Saturday, having also featured for 90 minutes in the midweek Champions League draw in Maribor, though José Mourinho had indicated that including Fàbregas had represented a “gamble” given he was carrying the injury.
 
Del Bosque said on Wednesday the player’s “muscle seems all right, but he complains and he is the best doctor” and that, “when a player of his calibre tells you that he is injured, you have to believe him”.
 
Chelsea have since conducted their own checks on their £30m signing from Barcelona, whose return to English football has been so eye-catching to date, and are confident rest during the international window will suffice to ensure he can face West Brom on 22 November. The same applies to Diego Costa, who was not selected by Spain given recent groin and hamstring trouble.
