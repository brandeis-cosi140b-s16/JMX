Liverpool’s Jon Flanagan out for at least six months after more knee surgery


Jon Flanagan has suffered another setback in his attempt to reclaim a first-team place at Liverpool after being ruled out for at least six months following knee surgery.
 
The 22-year-old has not featured once for Brendan Rodgers’ side this term having damaged a knee during pre-season. He returned to full training last month after two previous knee operations, and featured in the recent Liverpool All-Stars charity game at Anfield, but underwent a third procedure in London on Tuesday after scans had revealed a problem in his recovery.
 
Flanagan, an influential part of Liverpool’s title challenge in the second half of last season, is expected to be sidelined for between six and nine months as a result. It could be next year before the full-back is ready to challenge for a first-team role again should he require nine months to return to full fitness.
 
The latest injury setback could not have come at a worse time for Flanagan, who is out of contract at Anfield this summer and has been involved in protracted negotiations over a new deal with his boyhood club. Rodgers had stated previously, however, that Flanagan has a long-term future at Liverpool and the club opted for the latest operation to ensure a full recovery from the persistent knee trouble.
