Arsenal v Liverpool: match preview


Arsenal can take a significant step towards qualifying for the Champions League and simultaneously dampen Liverpool’s hopes with a victory on Saturday. Arsène Wenger and Olivier Giroud’s manager and player of the month awards for March are testament to how strong the Gunners have been. Liverpool will miss the experience of Steven Gerrard and Martin Skrtel but Brendan Rodgers will know his side still have the quality to secure a vital win. Graham Searles
