Liverpool to take no action over Raheem Sterling’s nightclub visit


Liverpool are unconcerned by a report that Raheem Sterling visited a London nightclub until the early hours on the night after his return from Estonia, where he had featured as a substitute for England in their 1-0 Euro 2016 qualifying victory.
 
Sterling had started the game in Tallinn on the bench after telling Roy Hodgson he was suffering from heavy legs on the eve of the match having featured regularly for club and country over the first two months of the domestic season. His 26-minute cameo ultimately yielded England the free-kick from which Wayne Rooney conjured the contest’s only goal to maintain the team’s perfect start to qualification.
 
The teenager flew back to Manchester with the squad after the game on 12 October and visited Cirque le Soir, near London’s Carnaby Street, the following night, along with his international team-mates Danny Welbeck, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Jonjo Shelvey. However, it is understood the player had been granted time off by his club in the wake of his commitments for his country and did not break any rules by visiting the nightclub. Indeed, the 19-year-old is teetotal and reported to training, as scheduled, at Melwood last Wednesday.
 
Sterling drew praise from his club manager, Brendan Rodgers, for the role he played in the 3-2 victory at his former club, Queens Park Rangers, on Sunday and is expected to play a part in this evening’s Champions League tie against Real Madrid at Anfield.
