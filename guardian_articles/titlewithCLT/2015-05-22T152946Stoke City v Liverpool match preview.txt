Stoke City v Liverpool: match preview


Brendan Rodgers’ Liverpool will secure a place in next season’s Europa League group stage if they beat Stoke in what will be Steven Gerrard’s 710th and final appearance for the club. Stoke are guaranteed a top-half finish for the second season in a row and have already surpassed their highest Premier League points tally, but Mark Hughes will not want to end the season with a defeat.
