Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling adds to controversy with shisha pipe episode


The Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling has become embroiled in more controversy after being pictured allegedly smoking a shisha pipe.
 
The 20-year-old, who was heckled at the club’s kit launch on Friday over his refusal to sign a new contract, was shown in the Sunday Mirror taking a drag from an orange pipe said to contain fruit-scented tobacco. The photograph on social media was accompanied by a caption that read “1 down another 3 to go” – suggesting there was more to be smoked.
 
Liverpool have not commented on the photograph but the manager, Brendan Rodgers, may take a dim view of the England international putting his health at risk in this fashion. Sterling is the latest Premier League footballer to be photographed with a shisha pipe. Arsène Wenger admonished Jack Wilshere this season after the Arsenal midfielder was snapped smoking for a second time.
 
Of greater concern to Rodgers is Sterling’s reluctance to commit to a new five-year contract at Anfield and his recent admission he has rejected a £100,000-a-week deal from the club. Sterling has two years remaining on his current £35,000-a-week contract and was subject to barbed comments from supporters when helping to launch Liverpool’s latest kit at Anfield.
