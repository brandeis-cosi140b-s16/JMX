Liverpool v Queens Park Rangers: match preview


QPR have only four games to overturn a four-point deficit and preserve their Premier League status with the first of three remaining away matches coming at a ground where they have won once in their history. The statistics do not augur well for Chris Ramsey’s team but they can take hope from the hangover Liverpool have been nursingsince their FA Cup semi-final defeat. Champions League qualification is fading from view for Brendan Rodgers’ men. Steven Gerrard, having been rested for the midweek defeat at Hull City, is available to make his penultimate Anfield appearance. Andy Hunter
