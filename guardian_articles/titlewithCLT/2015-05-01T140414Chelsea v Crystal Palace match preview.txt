Chelsea v Crystal Palace: match preview


Stamford Bridge will thrill in anticipation of Chelsea’s first Premier League title in five years. The hosts will secure the crown with victory and, given their unbeaten home record this season and Crystal Palace’s recent slip in standards with safety assured, the opportunity is there for the taking. “Them winning the league would be deserved because they’ve done extraordinarily well this season,” said Yannick Bolasie, “but we don’t want them to do it against us.” That may be wishful thinking given it is 33 years since Palace last won at Chelsea.
