Aston Villa v Liverpool: match preview


Villa beat Liverpool at Anfield in September and will feel liberated by last week’s win at Tottenham Hotspur, where Christian Benteke’s eighth goal in six games took Tim Sherwood’s team six points clear of the relegation zone. Liverpool, however, who stand 25 points above their opponents in the Premier League table, are edging back into form and have won the last six of seven FA Cup ties between these clubs. Villa’s success came in the semi-final of 1897. Daniel Sturridge’s fitness and Steven Gerrard’s availability pose selection dilemmas for Brendan Rodgers. Andy Hunter
