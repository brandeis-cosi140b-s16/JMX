Liverpool v Sunderland: match preview


Brendan Rodgers was under siege a week ago; now he is seeking a hat-trick of league wins for the first time since April. A back-to-basics approach has paid dividends for the Liverpool manager, who may again consider resting Steven Gerrard with a crucial Champions League game against Basel plus Manchester United to come next week. Sunderland have scored only five goals in six league away games this season and last won at Anfield in 1983. Andy Hunter
