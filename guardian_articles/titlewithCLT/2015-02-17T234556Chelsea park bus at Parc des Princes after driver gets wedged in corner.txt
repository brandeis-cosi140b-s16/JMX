Chelsea park bus at Parc des Princes after driver gets wedged in corner


Chelsea’s players and coaching staff had to walk into the Parc des Princes before the Champions League match against Paris Saint-Germain after the team’s bus got stuck on a ramp leading into the stadium.
 
Photographs showed the blue bus seemingly jammed in the corner of a narrow road and José Mourinho and his players finishing their journey on foot. Reports on social media said several windows in the bus had been broken. There were no reported injuries.
 
Chelsea were forced on the defensive after Edinson Cavani scored for the home side early in the second half but they could not be accused of parking the bus to secure a 1-1 draw in the last-16 first leg.
