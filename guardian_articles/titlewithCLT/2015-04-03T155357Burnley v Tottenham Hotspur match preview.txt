Burnley v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview


Burnley begin the day in the relegation zone but just one point from safety. Sean Dyche is unrelenting in his view that they can stay in the Premier League and his players will need to draw on every last drop of his defiance to keep Harry Kane from adding to his impressive goal tally. Tottenham are reliant on Kane and will need him to keep firing to maintain their Champions League ambitions. Graham Searles
