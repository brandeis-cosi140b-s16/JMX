Tottenham favourites to sign Danny Welbeck on loan from Manchester United


Tottenham Hotspur are the favourites to take Danny Welbeck from Manchester United on a loan deal, with the striker open to moving to White Hart Lane.
 
Although United have told Welbeck he can depart, they had previously stipulated that he could not move to a top-six team. However Radamel Falcao’s expected arrival for a £6m loan fee plus the Monaco striker’s wages, mean United may allow him to join Spurs.
 
Welbeck has decided to explore his options as he wants regular first-team football as a central striker. Louis van Gaal told Welbeck if he remained at the club then he would not play as one of the front-two in his 3-5-2 system.
 
Tom Cleverley, who can also leave, may decide to stay at United and become a free agent in May, when his contract expires.
