10 young players who just might be better than Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling

Max Meyer, Schalke 
 
 
Age 19 Estimated value £11m
 
The Germany Under-21s forward was one of the standout performers when Schalke beat Real Madrid 4-3 in the Champions League last month and he is a key part of their attempts to qualify, via the Bundesliga, for next season’s competition
 Julian Draxler, Schalke 
Age 21 Estimated value £19m
 
Happy with the ball on either foot, the speedy forward made his Bundesliga debut aged 16 and has not looked back since. Draxler has embarrassed numerous full-backs domestically and was part of the Germany squad that lifted the World Cup in Brazil
 Mateo Kovacic, Internazionale 
Age 20 Estimated value £16m
 
The attacking midfielder took Inter’s No10 shirt from Wesley Sneijder after arriving at San Siro from Dinamo Zagreb two years ago. According to the Inter legend Javier Zanetti, Kovacic is European football’s best prospect since Cristiano Ronaldo
 Hakan Calhanoglu, Bayer Leverkusen 
Age 21 Estimated value £13m
 
The Turkish midfielder is renowned for his free-kicks and general ability to score goals from long range. He has seamlessly made the step up to international football and scored a late winner for Turkey against Luxembourg last month
 Memphis Depay, PSV Eindhoven 
Age 21 Estimated value £12m
 
The Holland winger will almost certainly leave his club this summer with Manchester United believed, by many observers, to be his the most likely destination. The Eredivisie’s leading scorer, Depay has 22 goals this season
 Paulo Dybala, Palermo 
Age 21 Estimated value £17m
 
Having shone at his hometown Argentinian club Instituto, for whom he made his debut aged 17, Dybala was signed by Palermo three years ago and has continued to shine in Serie A. The forward has been linked with several top European clubs, including Arsenal
 Alen Halilovic, Barcelona 
Age 18 Estimated value £5.5m
 
The Croatian playmaker signed for Barcelona in 2014 but has yet to play for the first team. He is highly rated, however, and in 2012 became the second youngest player in Champions League history when he featured for Dinamo Zagreb against Paris Saint-Germain
 Davy Klaassen, Ajax 
Age 22 Estimated value £6m
 
The goalscoring midfielder made his Holland debut under Louis van Gaal last year. Klaassen’s technical style and attacking instincts have seen him likened to Dennis Bergkamp, who is currently assistant manager at the Amsterdam Arena
 Nikola Ninkovic, Partizan 
Age 20 Estimated value £750,000
 
The midfielder was made Partizan captain at 17 and has grown into a key figure for the Serbian club. Ninkovic was also suspended by his country for 12 months for his involvement in a brawl that followed a play-off defeat to England Under-21s in Krusevac in 2012
 Jesé Rodríguez, Real Madrid 
Age 22 Estimated value £11.5m
 
Given his initial chance by José Mourinho four years ago, Jesé is now a fans’ favourite at Real. The forward has seen his first-team chances at the Bernabéu restricted, however. He has managed just seven goals in the past two seasons
