Chelsea’s Josh McEachran joins Vitesse Arnhem on season-long loan


Chelsea have confirmed that their midfielder Josh McEachran has joined the Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem on a season-long loan, his fifth spell away from Stamford Bridge in three years.
 
McEachran, 21, joined the west London club as an eight-year-old but has struggled to make an impression on the first team since making his debut aged 17, and has spent time at Swansea City, Middlesbrough, Watford and most recently Wigan Athletic, where he made seven appearances.
 
The Englishman’s departure means Chelsea currently have 15 players out on loan, including Oriol Romeu, Ryan Bertrand, Lucas Piazon and Eden Hazard’s brother, Thorgan.
 
The 19-year-old academy product Lewis Baker is expected to be added to that list in the coming days with a potential move to Middlesbrough.
