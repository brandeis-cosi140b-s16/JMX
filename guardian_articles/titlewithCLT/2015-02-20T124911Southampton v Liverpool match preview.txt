Southampton v Liverpool: match preview


This contest will provide another test of Southampton’s staying power, with Ronald Koeman’s side attempting to rekindle some of their trademark verve after one win in four matches in all competitions. They confront a Liverpool team who have found their own upbeat rhythm, with one loss in 17 and, in Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Dejan Lovren, players who will relish returning to their former haunts. Only four points separate these sides at kick‑off. Each can deliver a statement of renewed intent with victory. Dominic Fifield
