Winner of Guardian/Audi competition given football table prize at Chelsea


The winner of the joint Guardian/Audi/Chelsea competition, Mark Williams, met some of Chelsea’s first-team players on Thursday when he was given his football table and took part in a Chelsea FC Training Experience.
 
John Terry, Gary Cahill, and Thibaut Courtois were among the first-teamers present as Williams, who was the winner out of more than 5,000 entrants, travelled to the club’s training ground.
 
Williams and one more winner were able to spend the day at Cobham on Thursday, two days before Chelsea won their sixth straight game at home in the Premier League, against West Bromwich Albion, to extend their lead at the top to seven points before Southampton played Aston Villa on Monday night.
 
This week Chelsea are aiming to secure their progress out of Champions League group G when they take on Schalke on Tuesday night.
