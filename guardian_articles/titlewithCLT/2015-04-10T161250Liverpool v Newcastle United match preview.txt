Liverpool v Newcastle United: match preview


Both managers require a response from their teams at Anfield but for very different reasons. Liverpool restored confidence by reaching the FA Cup semi-finals on Wednesday but, after consecutive defeats in the Premier League, can ill afford another slip if they are to catch any of the teams above them in the race for Champions League qualification. Newcastle should be safe on 35 points but, after the misery of another derby loss and amid growing supporter unrest, John Carver desperately needs to stem the decline. Andy Hunter
