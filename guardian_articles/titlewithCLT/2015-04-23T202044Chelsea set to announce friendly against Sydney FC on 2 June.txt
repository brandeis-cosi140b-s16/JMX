Chelsea set to announce friendly against Sydney FC on 2 June


Chelsea are set to announce a friendly against the Australian side Sydney FC in June, according to reports.
 
The Premier League leaders, who would wrap up a first title since 2010 with victories in their next two matches against Arsenal and Leicester, have already confirmed that they will play in the Champions Cup in the United States, which is expected to take place in July.
 
But despite the manager, José Mourinho, revealing earlier this month that Chelsea were in talks over a possible week-long trip to Japan the week after their final home match on 24 May, a report in the Sydney Morning Herald on Thursday claimed key stakeholders are in advanced negotiations over the friendly, which will be held on 2 June at the 83,500-capacity ANZ Stadium. The report states that a deal has been agreed to in principle and could be confirmed as early as next week.
 
If confirmed, it will be the second time in three years the newly crowned Premier League champions will play in Australia after Manchester United played the A-League All Stars in 2012. Sydney FC are also due to face Tottenham Hotspur at the same venue the week before.
 
The England defender, Gary Cahill, is unlikely to feature for Chelsea, however, given that the date clashes with Roy Hodgson’s side’s fixture against the Republic of Ireland two days later. The Brazil internationals Oscar, Ramires and Willian plus the Colombia winger Juan Cuadrado are also unlikely to make the trip because they will be preparing for the Copa América, which starts on 11 June.
