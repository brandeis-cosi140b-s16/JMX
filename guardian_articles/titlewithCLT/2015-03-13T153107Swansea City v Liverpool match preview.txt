Swansea City v Liverpool: match preview


Liverpool will arrive in Wales looking to continue the form that has taken them back into top-four contention: unbeaten in the league in 2015 and buoyed by recent wins over Manchester City, Southampton and Spurs. Swansea lost the reverse fixture 4-1 but Garry Monk’s side will not be overawed – in their last home game they came from behind to beat Manchester United 2-1. Sean Morrison
