Derby v Chelsea: Capital One Cup – as it happened


So Chelsea cruise into the last four, along with Sheffield United. Chelsea were far too good for Derby tonight, although the Rams will feel a little hard done by about Jake Buxton’s red card.But Chelsea deserved to win. The only negative for them was the injury to Kurt Zouma. Hopefully he’s okay. Thanks for reading. Night.
