Liverpool to speak to Raheem Sterling over ‘nitrous oxide’ video


Liverpool plan to speak to Raheem Sterling after a video showing the England winger allegedly taking nitrous oxide was released online during their 2-0 victory over Newcastle United.
 
The footage on thesun.co.uk show Sterling inhaling the gas from an orange balloon, laughing and then asking friends for another hit. The video, which it is claimed was taken at his home some days before the Newcastle game, then shows him either unconscious or asleep.
 
A club spokesperson said: “We are aware of the story and intend to speak to the player. Any subsequent action will be taken internally.”
 
The latest leak comes hot on the heels of a photograph of the 21-year-old smoking from a shisha pipe being put on the internet.
 
The video showing Sterling inhaling the gas was put online after Sterling scored the opener against Newcastle.
