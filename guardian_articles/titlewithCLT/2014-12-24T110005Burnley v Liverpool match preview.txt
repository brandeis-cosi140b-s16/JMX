Burnley v Liverpool: match preview


Liverpool failed to convert their dominance over Arsenal into three points last time out and Brendan Rodgers will be hoping for a much more efficient display at Turf Moor. Without Daniel Sturridge, though, they lack a consistent goal threat and never look like producing last season’s form. Sean Dyche is making progress at Burnley but he will be hoping Liverpool stumble again in his quest to move out of danger. Graham Searles
