Mario Balotelli: police investigate claim Liverpool striker confronted woman


Mario Balotelli is at the centre of an investigation by Greater Manchester police after allegedly confronting a woman who was taking photographs of his red Ferrari on Thursday.
 
The Liverpool striker was in Wythenshawe, apparently visiting his mother, Rose Barwuah, when the alleged incident with a local resident occurred. According to the woman he got “threateningly close” and demanded she stop.
 
A spokesman for Greater Manchester police said: “We are investigating a report of threatening behaviour following an incident in Pewsey Road, Wythenshawe.
 
“Officers will be speaking to all concerned in due course.”
 
Police sources said it was unlikely either party would be spoken to until tomorrow at the earliest.
 
A Liverpool spokesman said the club would not be commenting until all the facts had been established.
 
Balotelli was at the centre of controversy on Wednesday night when he swapped shirts with Real Madrid’s Pepe at half-time of Liverpool’s 3-0 defeat, angering his manager Brendan Rodgers.
