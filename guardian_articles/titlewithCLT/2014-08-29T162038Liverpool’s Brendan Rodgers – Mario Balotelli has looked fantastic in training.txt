Liverpool’s Brendan Rodgers – Mario Balotelli has looked fantastic in training


Liverpool’s manager Brendan Rodgers has been impressed by the impact Mario Balotelli has made in training but is keen to stress that no individual is bigger than the club.
 
Balotelli is in contention to make his debut in Sunday’s Premier League game at Tottenham following his move from Milan earlier this week.
 
Asked about the 24-year-old, Rodgers said: “He is fine. He has settled in very well and has looked fantastic in training.
 
“He is a good lad. The focus is very much on his football and he has done very well. He is engrossing himself into the club and the people, but more importantly into his football. I look forward to seeing that development over the coming years.”
 
When Rodgers was asked about the excitement among Liverpool fans at the Italy international’s arrival, the manager said: “This is not the Mario Balotelli show. He is a good player, a talented player. But he has got a lot of work to do here. We have a number of top-class players and the star of this team will always be the team.”
 
Balotelli could be joined by the fit-again Adam Lallana while three players that sustained problems during Monday’s 3-1 loss at Manchester City – Alberto Moreno (ankle), Martin Skrtel (knock) and Glen Johnson (thigh) – are to be assessed ahead of the Spurs match, with the latter of the trio looking most likely to miss out.
 
José Enrique will also have a late fitness test but Jon Flanagan is not yet ready to return as he works his way back to fitness from his knee injury. Daniel Agger and Oussama Assaidi remain sidelined.
