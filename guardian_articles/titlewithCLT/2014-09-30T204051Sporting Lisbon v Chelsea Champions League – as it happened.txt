Sporting Lisbon v Chelsea: Champions League – as it happened


So Nemanja Matic’s goal secures a fine win for Chelsea in the end, although they made unnecessarily hard work of it. That was largely down to the brilliance of the Sporting goalkeeper, Rui Patricio, to be fair. He made so many saves. Sporting had their moments, from Nani in particular, but anything less than a Chelsea win would have been a travesty. Thanks for reading. Night.
