Chelsea v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview


Wembley will host a repeat of the 2007-08 final, when Juande Ramos’s Tottenham triumphed over Avram Grant’s Chelsea in extra time. Grant paid the price for defeat and was sacked the following May while Ramos made it to October before Daniel Levy moved him on. Neither manager looks vulnerable this time around but José Mourinho would love to seal a trophy after hopes of a quadruple were dashed by Bradford City last month. Rich Flower
