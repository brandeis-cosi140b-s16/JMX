Sam Allardyce says Tottenham were lucky to get draw against West Ham


Sam Allardyce labelled Tottenham Hotspur as “lucky” after they staged a dramatic comeback to draw 2-2 with West Ham United at White Hart Lane.
 
The West Ham manager said Danny Rose’s 81st-minute goal, which made the scoreline 2-1, was a “ mishit”, while he lamented how Harry Kane’s equaliser had come from a fortuitous rebound after his penalty had been saved by Adrián.
 
“It was more luck than talent that got Tottenham a point,” Allardyce said. “The first goal was a complete mishit. When it bounces over the goalkeeper after it’s hit the floor, it’s so unusual that it sneaks into the corner. And from our point of view, Alex [Song] has to keep his hands off Kane because he’s going to take to the floor.”
 
It had a been a pulsating derby and there were recriminations on all sides, with Mauricio Pochettino, the Tottenham manager, arguing his side “deserved more than a point”. He also complained that West Ham’s second goal – scored by Diafra Sakho on 62 minutes – ought to have been disallowed for an offside against Enner Valencia who he said had touched Mark Noble’s cross before it reached Sakho. TV replays did not back him up, although there could be a discussion about whether Valencia was interfering with play. “The decisions were more against us than for us but this is football,” Pochettino said.
 
The match officials had allowed a minimum of five added minutes in the second half and Kane’s goal was timed at five minutes and 54 seconds. Allardyce was asked whether the referee, Jon Moss, ought to have blown for full-time before Kane converted the rebound.
 
“The answer to that is ‘yes’ but he wouldn’t be brave enough to do that at home, would he?” Allardyce said.
