Hull City v Chelsea: match preview


José Mourinho knows that with a six-point lead, a game in hand, and faltering rivals the title should be a formality. But the home draws with Southampton and Burnley and the European exit to PSG have exposed some hitherto unnoticed flaws. Chelsea need to show they are not flagging on Sunday, but Hull, just three points above the relegation places, cannot afford to be obliging hosts. Paul Chronnell
