Tottenham Hotspur v Liverpool: match preview


This fixture demonstrated the gulf between Tottenham Hotspur, under André Villas-Boas and Tim Sherwood, and those in the top four last season. Liverpool ran riot at White Hart Lane with Luis Suárez irrepressible, and then blitzed them in the return to the tune of a 9-0 aggregate scoreline. Mauricio Pochettino’s Spurs, with a perfect record to date under the Argentinian, will provide a sterner test and, if they click into their upbeat rhythm, could leave Liverpool’s start to the campaign feeling stodgy. The visitors, with Mario Balotelli in their ranks, will seek to reimpose their quality after losing at Manchester City on Monday. Dominic Fifield
