Steven Gerrard made substitute on 16th anniversary of Liverpool debut


Brendan Rodgers said all along he was going to rest  Steven Gerrard for what would have been his third game in seven days, and explained his reasoning midweek at the training ground.
 
It was only when the Liverpool manager saw the matchday programme that he realised he might have spoiled the 16th anniversary of his captain’s Liverpool debut. “I felt quite bad,” Rodgers said. “There are about 20 pictures of him and I’ve put him on the bench. At least he came on for 20 minutes or so at the end.” More controversially, Rodgers also benched most of his summer signings, meaning Gerrard had £87m worth of company.
 
The manager made no apologies. “They are signings for the future, not necessarily right now,” he said. “We needed a result, so I picked a team with experience that I thought could win the match – and that is what I will continue to do over the coming weeks.”
