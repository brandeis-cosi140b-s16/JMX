Brendan Rodgers: Liverpool will not compromise code of conduct


Brendan Rodgers has said Liverpool would not compromise their “extensive code of conduct”, while refusing to discuss Mario Balotelli’s imminent move to the club.
 
Balotelli attracted controversy during his spell at Manchester City under Roberto Mancini, but Rodgers hinted at the clauses the forward is understood to have been asked to agree before joining Liverpool. “Every club will have a code of conduct. We have a fantastic environment and a great culture. Nothing will ever shake that.
 
”People who know me well will tell you I look to try and develop the player and the person,” Rodgers said, speaking before the Premier League match against Manchester City on Monday. “Thankfully we have that culture here. I’ve shown before that as long as players care and want to learn, we can give them the opportunity to develop.
 
“Sometimes you have to take a risk with people but a lot of the time if you take that risk you get a reward for it. It’s not easy finding new players as there’s a small pool of players we could actually buy, but a lot of good work is going on.”
 
Earlier this month Rodgers stated “categorically” that he would not sign the Italy striker but he did admit last week that Liverpool were continuing to search for a striker to compliment Daniel Sturridge and Rickie Lambert following Luis Suàrez’s departure to Barcelona.
 
“I can categorically tell you that I can’t speak about it until the player is signed. When a player is signed then I will speak about them then. We always said we were working for another striker. If we can do a deal for anyone we will.”
