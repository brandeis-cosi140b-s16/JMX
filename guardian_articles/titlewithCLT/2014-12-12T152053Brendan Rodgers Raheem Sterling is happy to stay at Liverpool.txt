Brendan Rodgers: Raheem Sterling is happy to stay at Liverpool


Brendan Rodgers is confident that Raheem Sterling will remain a Liverpool player despite reports that the England winger has rejected the offer of a new contract.
 
Sterling’s current deal at Anfield expires in 2016 but he has so far refused to sign a new one, despite reports that he has been offered more than a 100% pay rise worth around £70,000 a week. But Rodgers, who takes his side to Old Trafford to face Manchester United on Sunday, has denied reports that Sterling is not happy at Liverpool.
 
“If you look at Raheem’s performances that does all his talking,” he said. “He is very happy here. I know Raheem very well and you can see he is happy here.
 
“It’s up to the club and his representatives to sort out the deal but there’s no unhappiness.”
 
Meanwhile Rodgers confirmed that Mario Balotelli could pay some part against United with the striker having returned to training this week. “He’s only just come back into training so we will see what his fitness is like,” he said. “In the last few days he’s looked good and we’ll give him every chance.”
