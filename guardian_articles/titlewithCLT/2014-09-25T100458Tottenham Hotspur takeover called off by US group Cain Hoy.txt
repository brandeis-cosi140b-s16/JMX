Tottenham Hotspur takeover called off by US group Cain Hoy


The potential takeover of Tottenham by an investment group from the United States has been called off.
 
Cain Hoy Enterprises said it had “terminated its assessment and accordingly is no longer considering making an offer for Tottenham Hotspur”.
 
The group said two weeks ago that it was in the “preliminary stages” of assessing an offer for Spurs though the club was insistent it was not entertaining any bids. “There are no ongoing discussions with Cain Hoy. The club is focused on the new stadium development and the season ahead,” Spurs, said to be valued at £1bn by their owner Joe Lewis, emphasised at the time.
 
Cain released a statement on Thursday saying: “On 12 September 2014, having previously approached Tottenham Hotspur with a proposal, Cain Hoy Enterprises confirmed that it was at the preliminary stages of assessing a cash offer for Tottenham Hotspur.
 
“Cain Hoy has subsequently terminated its assessment and accordingly is no longer considering making an offer for Tottenham Hotspur.”
