Mamadou Sakho's restoration work extends beyond his career at Liverpool


Liverpool’s France international centre-back was busy lending a hand in Bootle, Merseyside, yesterday for the charities An Hour for Others and Progressive Lifestyle Solutions, who help restore houses for people at risk of homelessness. The defender got stuck into some painting after bringing some goodies round to the house for the local builders who had given up their time to help.

The defender has often, unfairly, been described as looking awkward while doing good things for Liverpool. Looks pretty smooth here.

Just fill that bucket up and you can knock off.
