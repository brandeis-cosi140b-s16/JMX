Southampton steward body-slams Liverpool fan who invaded the pitch


Body-slamming appears to be catching on in football stadiums after a steward took swift action to neutralise a pitch invader during Liverpool’s 2-0 victory over Southampton on Sunday.
 
Worcester City’s Shabir Khan sent social media into overdrive on Saturday with his WWE impersonation on Stockport’s Charlie Russell but while he received a red card for his troubles, the St Mary’s steward has been praised for his handling of the overzealous Liverpool supporter.
 
It was Liverpool’s second goal – scored by Raheem Sterling – that prompted the pitch invasion but the steward was wise to it and left the supporter wishing he had stayed in his seat.
