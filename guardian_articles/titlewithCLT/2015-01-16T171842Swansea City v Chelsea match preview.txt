Swansea City v Chelsea: match preview


José Mourinho will want nothing but all three points against Swansea City. Chelsea could potentially move further ahead of title rivals Manchester City as the latter could drop points against Arsenal. While Swansea will be relying on Bafétimbi Gomis to replace the goal threat of Wilfried Bony, the Frenchman may lack the quality needed to break down Chelsea’s solid defensive line.
