Liverpool v West Bromwich Albion: match preview


Brendan Rodgers made some disparaging remarks about Mario Balotelli’s recent performances after losing away to Basel in midweek in the Champions League. Maybe the Liverpool boss will regret not picking up Danny Welbeck instead. However if Balotelli turns around Liverpool’s recent run of poor form by spearheading a first league win in four games against an improving West Brom side then, you can be sure, Rodgers and Liverpool fans will be smiling again.
