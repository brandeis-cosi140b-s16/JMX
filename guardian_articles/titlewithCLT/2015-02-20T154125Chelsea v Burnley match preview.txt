Chelsea v Burnley: match preview


José Mourinho will be supremely confident Chelsea can sweep Burnley aside and continue their march towards the Premier League title. Diego Costa returns to the starting lineup after suspension, which will strike fear into Burnley hearts. Sean Dyche, however, will remind his players of Bradford’s unbelievable FA Cup upset at Stamford Bridge and will want them to reproduce that magic. Graham Searles
