Manchester United v Liverpool: match preview


David Moyes’s branding of Liverpool as favourites against Manchester United at Old Trafford for last season’s edition of this fixture hardly enamoured the Scot to fans. In Louis van Gaal they now have a manager to believe in and he “welcomes” Brendan Rodgers’ side seeking a six consecutive win. The Liverpool manager is feeling serious heat due to average domestic form and being knocked out of the Champions League and a victory over the auld enemy would be a fair fillip. Jamie Jackson
