Football transfer rumours: Tottenham to take Benfica’s Eduardo Salvio?


The Mill is struggling. Sore eyes. Headache. Aching bones. Hot flushes. Cold sweats. That all-encompassing sense of weariness and exhaustion. No, we’re not rewatching Aston Villa v Leicester from the weekend. The Mill has got the flu. And this makes the Mill miserable.
 
But not as miserable as today’s selection of transfer tittle-tattle. The cupboard, dear readers, is pretty bare. The best of a pretty disappointing bunch is the news that Tottenham are interested in the £20m-rated Benfica winger Eduardo Salvio. At the weekend Spurs had the 24-year-old watched by scouts, all of whom collected their Spending The Weekend In Lisbon badge, and a move is likely in the summer.
 
Mauricio Pochettino’s interest in Salvio is down to the fact that his first choice, Southampton’s Jay Rodriguez, is also on the summer shopping lists of Liverpool and Manchester City, one of whom will definitely be able to offer Champions League football, while the other can provide a Saints 2013-14 reunion.
 
Elsewhere, Sam Allardyce is heading out of West Ham in the summer because reasons. Besiktas manager Slaven Bilic and Real Sociedad’s David Moyes are being lined up to replace him.

And Bournemouth want Crystal Palace’s Glenn Murray on loan until the end of the season.
