Chelsea’s Diego Costa to undergo tests in Spain on hamstring injury


Chelsea striker Diego Costa will undergo tests in London on Monday to assess whether he can remain in the Spain squad for the upcoming internationals against Ukraine and Holland.
 
Costa limped off with a hamstring injury in the second half of Chelsea’s 3-2 win at Hull on Sunday, sparking fears he may withdraw from international duty.
 
The Spanish federation said in a statement: “Costa will undergo tests on Monday in London and the results will be available to Spain’s medical staff for their evaluation.”
 
The Brazilian-born forward missed games against Belarus and Germany in November because of a hamstring problem.
 
Málaga striker Juanmi has been added to the squad and will arrive at Spain’s headquarters in Madrid tonight. Juanmi, who has scored seven goals in 24 games for Málaga this season, has won the European Championship twice with Spain’s Under-19 team but is yet to be capped at senior level.
 
Spain are without Valencia forward Paco Alcácer, who recently recovered from a knee injury but is not fully fit.
 
Del Bosque has also named Sevilla winger Vitolo, who has yet to play for Spain, in the squad, as well as Juventus sriker Álvaro Morata.
 
Spain host Ukraine in a Euro 2016 qualifier on 27 March before travelling to Holland for a friendly four days later.
