Liverpool agree £12m fee to sign Alberto Moreno from Sevilla


Liverpool’s long-running pursuit of Alberto Moreno has come to a successful conclusion after Sevilla accepted an initial £12m fee for the left-back.
 
The manager Brendan Rodgers had identified the 21-year-old as his first-choice full-back earlier in the summer only for Sevilla to insist on a €20m deal and reject Liverpool’s proposed payment structure.
 
However, following further talks in Cardiff between the Liverpool chief executive Ian Ayre and Sevilla officials on Tuesday, a compromise was finally reached and Moreno was withdrawn from the Uefa Super Cup meeting against Real Madrid. The Spain youth international will become Liverpool’s eighth signing of the summer.
 
Martin Kelly, meanwhile, is set to head out of Anfield after Liverpool accepted a £1.5m bid from Crystal Palace for the defender, whose Liverpool career has been hindered by a serious knee injury in recent years.
