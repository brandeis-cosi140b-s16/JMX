Tottenham Hotspur v Crystal Palace: match preview


Tottenham suffered an inevitable reality check at Chelsea on Wednesday but they will seek to use the positivity that returned to White Hart Lane in the win over Everton last weekend. Mauricio Pochettino wants to see more sustained evidence that his philosophy is taking root and he will again be without Emmanuel Adebayor, who remains weak after a virus. Crystal Palace have promised to be positive. “If you go into away games thinking a point is good, you tend to lose,” Julián Speroni said. David Hytner
