Europa League draw: Liverpool face Besiktas in last 32


Liverpool have been drawn against Besiktas in the Europa League last 32 while Tottenham Hotspur will face Fiorentina, Everton will play Young Boys and Celtic will have to beat Internazionale over two legs.
 
Having finished third in their Champions League group behind Real Madrid and Basel, Liverpool were unseeded for this draw and now face a daunting trip to Turkey, where they will have to deal with a fervent atmosphere and an attack led by former Newcastle and Chelsea striker Demba Ba.
 
Micah Richards will make a return to England with Fiorentina who have drawn Tottenham. The Florence-based side have been inconsistent in Serie A this season, but impressed in the earlier round of the Europa League, comfortably winning their group with one match to spare.
 
Everton, who finished top of their Europa League group ahead of Wolfsburg, were the only British team to be seeded for the draw, and appear to have been handed the easiest tie – against Swiss side Young Boys – a team they have never competitively faced.
 
Celtic narrowly progressed from Group D despite finishing with a negative goal difference and face Italian giants Internazionale, who were unbeaten in their group and re-appointed Roberto Mancini as head coach in November.
 
Liverpool, Olympiakos, Zenit St Petersburg, Anderlecht, Roma, Ajax, Sporting Lisbon and Athletic Bilbao all enter the competition at this point, having finished in third place in their respective groups in this season’s Champions League.
 
The first-leg tie will be played on 19 February and the return leg is set for 26 February.
