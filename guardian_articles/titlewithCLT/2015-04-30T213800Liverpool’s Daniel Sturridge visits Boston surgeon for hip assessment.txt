Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge visits Boston surgeon for hip assessment


Daniel Sturridge has visited a surgeon in Boston to assess whether an operation is required on the hip injury that may have brought his season to a premature end.
 
The Liverpool striker, who has not played for Brendan Rodgers’ team since suffering the injury at Blackburn Rovers on 8 April, may require minor surgery on his latest fitness problem and has travelled to the United States for an assessment. He spent time earlier this season with the medical staff of the Boston Red Sox, who share owners with Liverpool in Fenway Sports Group, in an attempt to solve the thigh and calf problems that had blighted his season.
 
Rodgers has said he is unsure whether the 25-year-old will play for Liverpool again before the summer as a result of the hip injury. Surgery, if it is deemed the best course of action, may ensure the striker is fit for the start of pre-season training.
 
Sturridge has appeared in only 18 of Liverpool’s 54 matches this season and his absences have compounded the loss of Luis Suárez and contributed to the dramatic decline in the team’s goals tally. His status as Liverpool’s leading striker for next season is under threat with Rodgers stating he wants to sign a proven goalscorer able to perform “at the top level every week”.
 
Memphis Depay, PSV Eindhoven’s leading scorer this season with 21 goals in their title-winning campaign, albeit while operating from the wing, is a prime target for the Liverpool manager.
