Chelsea v Liverpool: match preview


Liverpool will line up in the guard of honour for the champions as Stamford Bridge fans revel in their favourites’ success, with Steven Gerrard presumably braced for a galling afternoon crammed with reminders of that slip and those spurned transfers to these parts. The visitors’ captain will hardly care, and there is likely to be a show of respect from José Mourinho for a player he has always admired. Chelsea should be rested after four days off. Liverpool, clinging to faint hopes of a top-four finish, must become the first visiting team to triumph here this season. Dominic Fifield
