Sunderland v Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened


Smashing performance from Sunderland, that. They were much the better side in the second half, and could - should - have scored at least once. Still, a splendid point for Gus Poyet, and an off-day for Fabregas. It’s probably not a coincidence that when he didn’t play well, neither did Chelsea.
