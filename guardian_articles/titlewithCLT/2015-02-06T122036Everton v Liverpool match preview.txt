Everton v Liverpool: match preview


Brendan Rodgers’ jaw almost hit the floor when it was put to him that both Merseyside rivals head in to the 224th derby in a good run of form. Liverpool have won eight of their past 14 matches, Everton two in 14. Hence his astonishment. Everton did collect a crucial first win of 2015 at Crystal Palace last Saturday and will need to maintain the dogged defending of Selhurst Park as Steven Gerrard looks to bow out of this historic fixture emphatically.
