Ludogorets v Liverpool | Champions League - as it happened


And that’s it. Liverpool end a sequence of three Champions League reverses in a row, and four losses on the bounce in all competitions, but this draw will feel like another defeat. “Another chuffing corner,” harumphs Matt Dony, which only registers a four on the Brendan Rodgers Fackin Hell O Meter™. But here’s the good news for Liverpool: they aren’t out of the Champions League. Real Madrid won in Basel, so a win for Brendan Rodgers side against the Swiss at Anfield will see them through. In that sense, the late equaliser changed nothing, though it does mean they’re yet to be guaranteed a minimum of Europa League participation in the new year. They’d have had that in the bag if they’d managed to hold on. Gotta love the Champions League!
