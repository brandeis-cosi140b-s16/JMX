Liverpool v Everton: match preview


It is 15 years to the day since Everton last won at Anfield but the omen will be meaningless unless their vulnerable defending improves quickly. An open, error-prone opponent is just what Liverpool need as they look to rediscover last season’s form but much will depend on Daniel Sturridge’s fitness and Raheem Sterling’s energy levels after his 120-minute outing against Middlesbrough on Tuesday. The 223rd Merseyside derby is one neither team can afford to lose. Andy Hunter
