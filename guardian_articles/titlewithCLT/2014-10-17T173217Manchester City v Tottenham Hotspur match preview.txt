Manchester City v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview


Manuel Pellegrini insists that this year’s Spurs vintage are a different proposition following the arrival of Mauricio Pochettino as the manager but with Chelsea showing little sign of any early-season fade Manchester City really must beat the visitors to maintain pressure. Yaya Touré is in the match-day 18 and may well have to start despite Tuesday’s trip to Russia for the vital Champions League match against CSKA Moscow. Jamie Jackson
