Tottenham Hotspur v Queens Park Rangers: match preview


Harry Redknapp makes his first return to White Hart Lane, where he hoisted Tottenham Hotspur from the relegation zone to regular Champions League contenders during almost four years in north London, since his acrimonious divorce from Daniel Levy. His former player Danny Rose has led the calls for the 67-year-old to be granted “a good reception”, though QPR will hope Spurs are sluggish after their Europa League qualifying exploits in Cyprus on Thursday. It is 20 years since Rangers last triumphed across the capital at Spurs. Their new signings, Mauricio Isla and Leroy Fer, should feature. Dominic Fifield
