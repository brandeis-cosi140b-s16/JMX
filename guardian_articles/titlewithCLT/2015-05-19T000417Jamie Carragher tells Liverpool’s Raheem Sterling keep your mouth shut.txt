Jamie Carragher tells Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling: keep your mouth shut


Jamie Carragher has reacted to the news that Raheem Sterling is demanding a move away from Liverpool by telling him to “keep your mouth shut” and “get on with playing football”.
 
“For a 20-year-old kid to be taking on Liverpool Football Club over a contract. To the pit of my stomach that just winds me up, it angers me,” Carragher said on Sky’s Monday Night Football.

“The lad is from London and he obviously wants to go back home. It might not be about money. It may be about trophies or playing in the Champions League. If it’s about trophies, Liverpool had a chance for a trophy this year, in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley against Aston Villa. Where was Sterling? If you want trophies, they don’t get given to you, you have to earn them, you have to play well in big games. What did Liverpool do in the Champions League? Nothing. What did Sterling do? Nothing.
 
“To do what he’s done now. There’s nothing worse than that. You keep your mouth shut - get on with playing football.”
 
Carragher’s outburst follows the news that Sterling is expected to inform Liverpool this week that he wishes to leave the club, with Manchester City ready to test Anfield’s resolve that the England international will not be sold.
