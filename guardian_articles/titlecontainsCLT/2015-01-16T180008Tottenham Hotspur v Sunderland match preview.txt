Tottenham Hotspur v Sunderland: match preview


Jermain Defoe looks set to start against his former club Tottenham Hotspur in his first game for new employers Sunderland. The visitors will hope that Defoe continues his record of scoring on debut for every club he has played for to help produce a shock result. Spurs, however, have a new talisman in Harry Kane and no doubt will rely on the Englishman to provide the difference. Graham Searles
