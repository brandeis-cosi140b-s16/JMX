Tottenham Hotspur v Newcastle United: match preview


The pressure is not exactly off Alan Pardew, as he heads back to his home-town of London to face Tottenham but last Saturday’s home win over Leicester bought the Newcastle manager some respite. The long overdue first league victory of the season has, in Pardew’s words, given the club “the chance to build something” but the road ahead still looks long and arduous, and it will not be easy in the post-rabona landscape at White Hart Lane.
