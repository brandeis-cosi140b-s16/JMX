Liverpool’s Brendan Rodgers: criticism of Raheem Sterling is incredible


Brendan Rodgers has described recent criticism of Raheem Sterling as “incredible” after reports that the Liverpool forward is refusing to sign a contract extension to stay at Anfield.
 
Sterling scored twice for Liverpool in the 3-1 victory over Bournemouth in the Capital One Cup quarter-final on Wednesday night – his first goals since the Premier League defeat to West Ham on 20 September.
 
The England player has been criticised over reports that he has rejected the offer of a new deal worth around £70,000 a week. But Rodgers, who is expected to keep faith with Sterling in a striker’s role for Sunday’s meeting with Arsenal, believes that was totally unjustified.
 
“I said before he’s an outstanding talent who has been great for us,” the Liverpool manager said. “It’s been incredible the stick the kid has received with people trying to criticise him and put the focus on to him.
 
“He’s been outstanding for us and it was another great performance from him the other night in a difficult game.”

Liverpool are 11th in the Premier League at the start of the weekend and five points behind Sunday’s opponents. Having ended a run of four matches without a win on Wednesday, Rodgers is hopeful that they can build on that with a victory against Arsène Wenger’s side.
 
“[A win] will continue our spirit and our focus,” he said. “They are a top side with outstanding players. For us it will good for confidence. But it will be a difficult game.”
