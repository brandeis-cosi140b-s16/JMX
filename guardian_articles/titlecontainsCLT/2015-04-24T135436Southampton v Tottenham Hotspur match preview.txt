Southampton v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview


Mauricio Pochettino does not hide the fact that he would rather be spared the toils of the Europa League next season, yet he will surely want Tottenham to win on his return to St Mary’s. Ronald Koeman, by contrast, is eager for his team to qualify for European competition and victory over Spurs would help secure that and also give the club more points than they achieved under the Argentinian last term.
