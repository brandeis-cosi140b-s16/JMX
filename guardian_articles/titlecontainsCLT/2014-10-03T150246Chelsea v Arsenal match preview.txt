Chelsea v Arsenal: match preview


The focus will be drawn to Cesc Fàbregas as he confronts his former club for the first time since returning to the Premier League, but the onus is on Arsenal to make a positive impression at Stamford Bridge. This team were thrashed 6-0 in the corresponding fixture back in March in the manager’s 1,000th game in charge, and Arsène Wenger has yet to defeat a José Mourinho side in 11 previous meetings. This is a contest between the division’s two remaining unbeaten teams: it would be a timely occasion for Wenger to break that duck. Dominic Fifield
