Hull City v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview


Hull City will want to pick themselves up after a deserved 1-0 defeat to Burnley in their last outing, a display considerably below what manager Steve Bruce has come to expect. Not much is better at Tottenham Hotspur. After Emmanuel Adebayor’s controversial comments that the players would rather play away, failure to win at the KC Stadium will leave them with nowhere to hide from their expectant fans.
