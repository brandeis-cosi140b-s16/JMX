Manchester City v Liverpool: match preview


This is only the second match of the season yet there is the potential double reward of a title rival being defeated plus crucial momentum achieved. As the deal for Mario Balotelli was not done in time for the forward to be available for Liverpool, Manchester City must surely fancy their chances of finishing Monday evening with all three points, especially as only Alvaro Negredo and Eliaquim Mangala are unavailable to Manuel Pellegrini.
