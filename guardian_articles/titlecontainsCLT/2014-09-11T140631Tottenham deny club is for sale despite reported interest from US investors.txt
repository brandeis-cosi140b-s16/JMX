Tottenham deny club is for sale despite reported interest from US investors


Tottenham Hotspur have denied a report that their owner, Joe Lewis, has put the club up for sale but they have reportedly received a preliminary inquiry from the US private investment company Cain Hoy.
 
According to the Daily Telegraph, Cain Hoy’s head of European investment, Jonathan Goldstein, has registered an interest in submitting a takeover bid on behalf of a number of American businessmen.
 
There had been claims that Lewis, who bought the club 13 years ago for £22m, was looking for investors willing to pay a £1bn price but Spurs insisted there were no plans to change ownership.
 
The club said the commercial priority was developing a new stadium at White Hart Lane. “Contrary to recent press speculation, neither the club, nor its majority shareholder, are in any takeover discussions and the focus of the club is fully on delivering the new stadium project,” a spokesperson said.
 
“Accordingly, we are at a stage where we are starting to engage with a number of financing institutions and potential funders in respect of the stadium development project.”
 
Spurs intend to have a new stadium on the current site ready for the 2018-19 season and will have to play the previous season away from White Hart Lane. Suggested alternative venues include Milton Keynes, Wembley and even Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium. “Every single decision that the club makes is to improve the club and give better solutions or facilities to our supporters,” their manager, Mauricio Pochettino, said. “So I always back these decisions.”
