David Beckham tips Tottenham’s Harry Kane for England call-up


David Beckham believes Harry Kane’s blistering performances have proved he is ready for an England call-up.
 
Kane starred for Tottenham as he took his season’s tally to 22 goals in Saturday’s 2-1 victory over Arsenal. The 21-year-old is widely tipped to be included in manager Roy Hodgson’s next England squad when they face Lithuania in a Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley at the end of March.
 
Beckham, who won 115 caps for his country before retiring in 2009, thinks that would be richly deserved. “Being English, and seeing someone like Harry and the way he’s playing and the way he’s played this season, he’s having a stunning year,” he said at the launch of a Unicef fund for children in danger across the world in London. “I think everyone is singing his praises, and rightly so. He’s 21, he’s working hard and has got a good head on his shoulders, so we will see.”
 
Beckham made his England debut against Moldova at the age of 21 in September 1996 and he believes Kane has already shown he is capable of making the step up. “It doesn’t matter what age you are – if you’re good enough then you should play,” he said.
 
Reports on Monday said Beckham’s former club Real Madrid have scouted Kane on three occasions this season. The product of the Tottenham youth team signed a five-and-a-half-year contract at the start of the month having already agreed an improved deal at the start of the season.
