No Liverpool deal with Raheem Sterling before summer, says Brendan Rodgers


Brendan Rodgers has revealed that Raheem Sterling’s contract negotiations will not be concluded before the end of the season amid continued speculation the Liverpool forward could be on his way out of Anfield.
 
The 20-year-old signed a five-year contract in 2012 but his representatives have been in talks with Liverpool over a new deal for several months. Liverpool have tabled a what Rodgers has described as an “incredible” offer – reported to be in the region of £100,000 a week but the manager is resigned to waiting for a solution until the summer, saying nothing will be resolved “between now and end of the season”.
 
Asked whether there was likely to be a solution found soon Rodgers said: “Not between now and the end of the season.
 
“It has been made clear by Raheem’s representative and the boy himself he just wants to concentrate on his football and see what can be resolved in the summer. I am sure it will be resolved and the concentration for Raheem is now on his football and it is clear the terms of when those talks will begin again.”
 
With contract negotiations dragging on Sterling has found himself linked with some of Europe’s top clubs, with Manchester City the latest to be linked after reports on Friday they were considering a £50m bid.
 
Rodgers dismissed that and all other links with. “It is all speculation. It is something we can’t worry ourselves on. The boy is happy here and I repeat if you have the interest of the kid and his football development at this stage of his career this is the best place to be.”
