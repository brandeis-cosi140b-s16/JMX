Liverpool close to agreeing new deal for Raheem Sterling


Liverpool are close to finalising a new contract for Raheem Sterling following the latest round of negotiations with the England winger’s representatives.
 
Ian Ayre, the Liverpool chief executive, held another positive meeting with the 20-year-old’s representatives in London on Monday and a new long-term deal for the increasingly influential Sterling is expected to be signed soon.
 
No announcement is imminent, with Sterling heading straight into Liverpool’s preparations for Saturday’s game at Sunderland from a short holiday in Jamaica, but the legalities of the new contract may be completed within the next week.
 
Sterling signed a five-year contract with Liverpool in 2012 and is expected to agree another five-year term, albeit on more lucrative terms given his continued progress under Brendan Rodgers.
