Leicester City v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview


Leicester City’s troubles continue and Nigel Pearson will be feeling some pressure as his side are without a win in 12 matches. Mauricio Pochettino, however, will be feeling much better after a run of three victories in all competitions. A win would be a long overdue Christmas present for the Foxes but against high-spirited Tottenham Hotspur it could be a long shot. Graham Searles
