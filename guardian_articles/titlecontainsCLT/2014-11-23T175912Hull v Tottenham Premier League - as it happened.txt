Hull v Tottenham: Premier League - as it happened


Well, that was a peculiar enough afternoon. Hull were very good for 50 minutes, but, on reflection, though there was no need for Ramirez to be sent off, neither was there a need for him to invite the opportunity. Hull might also feel that they could have done more subsequently - they posed very little threat on the break - but, on the other hand, shut Spurs down pretty effectively in the final fifteen minutes. 
 
And then there’s Spurs. They didn’t play at all well, but handed the advantage by the referee, remembered enough of what they’re meant to know to force themselves back into the game, and persevered when it looked like they’d only wind up with a draw. They’re now tenth in the table, ahead of Liverpool and Stoke, while Hull stay fifth-bottom.
