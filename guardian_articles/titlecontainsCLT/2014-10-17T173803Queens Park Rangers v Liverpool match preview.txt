Queens Park Rangers v Liverpool: match preview


While Liverpool will have one eye on their match against Real Madrid on Wednesday, Brendan Rodgers knows that they cannot afford another slip-up in the Premier League after an inconsistent start to the season. Yet Queens Park R,angers rock bottom and in dismal form, should not pose them too many problems. Liverpool have been boosted by Daniel Sturridge’s return from injury, while Raheem Sterling has a point to prove after the nonsense of the past week. Jacob Steinberg
