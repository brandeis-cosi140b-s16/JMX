Southampton’s Sadio Mané dropped after late arrival for Liverpool clash


Southampton’s Sadio Mané could face disciplinary action after he turned up half an hour late for Sunday’s home defeat to Liverpool, Ronald Koeman has revealed.
 
Mané was dropped to the bench for Southampton’s 2-0 loss, having failed to arrive on time for the club’s 1pm meeting prior to the 4.15pm kick-off at St Mary’s, coming on in the 57th minute with his side trailing to Philippe Coutinho’s stunning third-minute opener.
 
Filip Djuricic, on loan from Benfica, made his first start for the club in the absence of the 22-year-old Senegal international and Koeman said Mané’s late arrival was unacceptable.
 
“He was 25 to 30 minutes too late for the pre-meal and we have rules, instructions with the players and everybody can be late one day in a morning, but you can’t be late at one o’clock when you have to play against Liverpool,” he said. “The explanation is between the player and the coach, but he was too late and I can’t and won’t accept that.”
