Newcastle United v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview


Newcastle have lost five consecutive Premier League games and it looks as if some players have already begun to think of pastures new. John Carver will find it tough motivating his side considering their abject form and Tottenham Hotspur will be looking to capitalise on this. Spurs may also struggle for motivation, though, as it looks as if they will miss out on the Champions League. Graham Searles
