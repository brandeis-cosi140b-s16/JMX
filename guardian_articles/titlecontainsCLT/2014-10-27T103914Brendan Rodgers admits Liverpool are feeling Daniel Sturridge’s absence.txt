Brendan Rodgers admits Liverpool are feeling Daniel Sturridge’s absence


Brendan Rodgers said Liverpool are feeling the absence of Daniel Sturridge, adding his side must remain in contention towards the top of the Premier League until the striker returns.
 
Sturridge has not played for Liverpool since late August after suffering a thigh injury when on England duty at the start of September before picking up a calf problem on his return to training.
 
In his absence Liverpool have managed seven goals in six Premier League matches while the £16m summer signing Mario Balotelli has scored once in 11 appearances, that effort coming in the Champions League win over Ludogorets.
 
The 0-0 home draw with Hull City left Liverpool in seventh place, nine points behind the leaders Chelsea, and Rodgers has already moved to temper expectations at Anfield following last season’s second place.
 
Sturridge scored 24 goals last season and Rodgers, who is refusing to put on timescale on the striker’s return, admits Liverpool are hamstrung without him.
 
“When you are under the cosh, you know that you have strikers who can score out of nothing. It is a big weapon. Sturridge is one of them,” Rodgers told the club’s website. “That is where we aim to get with Daniel. When he comes back into the team, you will see the confidence because of the movement and the dynamic.
 
“We just have to work without [him] and while we are doing that, we are staying up and around the top end of the table.”
