Mario Balotelli set to return for Liverpool despite hamstring injury


Mario Balotelli is expected to be available for Liverpool’s trip to Crystal Palace on Sunday when the manager Brendan Rodgers’ striking options should finally include the fit-again Daniel Sturridge.
 
Balotelli was forced to withdraw from Italy’s European Championship qualifier against Croatia and friendly against Albania after suffering a hamstring injury in training on Friday. The setback cost the Liverpool striker a much-needed chance to impress Antonio Conte having been overlooked for the first four matches of the new Italian coach’s reign.
 
The 24-year-old has returned to Merseyside for treatment but the injury is not expected to keep the striker sidelined for an extended period and, providing there is no reaction in training this week, he could be considered for the visit to Selhurst Park. Whether Balotelli will be selected by Rodgers is a different matter, however, with the Italian yet to score for Liverpool in the Premier League and Sturridge available for the first time in three months.
 
Sturridge has not featured since the 3-0 win at Tottenham Hotspur on 31 August, Liverpool’s most encouraging display of a trying campaign and the only time this season that Rodgers has been able to pair Balotelli with the England international.
 
The 25-year-old has missed 14 matches due to a thigh injury sustained while training with England plus a calf problem suffered on his return to full training with Liverpool. Sturridge stepped up his recovery at Melwood last week and his fitness will come as a relief to Rodgers, whose team have sorely missed not only Luis Suárez this season but the former Chelsea forward who scored 22 Premier League goals last term.
