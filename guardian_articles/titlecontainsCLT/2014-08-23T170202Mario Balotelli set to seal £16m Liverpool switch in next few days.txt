Mario Balotelli set to seal £16m Liverpool switch in next few days


Mario Balotelli is set to seal his return to the Premier League within the next few days following constructive talks with Brendan Rodgers. Liverpool have agreed a £16m fee with Milan for the Italy international and a three-year contract worth a basic £80,000-a-week plus £40,000 in performance and behaviour incentives.
 
The deal, however, was dependent on the Liverpool manager being convinced of Balotelli’s willingness to develop at Anfield and it is understood their meeting at Melwood training ground on Friday progressed well. The 24-year-old had the second part of his medical on Saturday before returning to Italy and is expected back on Merseyside to complete the transfer on Sunday or Monday. His contract includes an option for Liverpool to keep the former Internazionale and Manchester City forward for a fourth year.
 
Balotelli will not be eligible to face City at the Etihad Stadium on Monday should he sign that day, but could make his debut at Tottenham Hotspur next Sunday.
