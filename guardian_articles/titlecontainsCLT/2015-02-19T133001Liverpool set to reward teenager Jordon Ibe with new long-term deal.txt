Liverpool set to reward teenager Jordon Ibe with new long-term deal


Liverpool intend to reward Jordon Ibeâ€™s impressive impact with a new long-term contract. The 19-year-old midfielder won the penalty that was converted by Mario Balotelli in the win over Besiktas and followed up a man-of-the-match display in the goalless derby at Everton with an influential performance in the 3-2 defeat of Tottenham Hotspur.
 
Ibe is under contract at Anfield until 2017 but the club are set to offer the former Wycombe Wanderers player an improved deal.
 
The club recently tied Philippe Coutinho to a new five-year contract but have hit stalemate in their attempts to agree extensions on improved terms with Raheem Sterling and Jordan Henderson.
