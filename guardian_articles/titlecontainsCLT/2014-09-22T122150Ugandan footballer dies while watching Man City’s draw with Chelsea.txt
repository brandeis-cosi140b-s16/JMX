Ugandan footballer dies while watching Man City’s draw with Chelsea


A Ugandan footballer collapsed and subsequently died following Frank Lampard’s equaliser for Manchester City against Chelsea on Sunday, according to reports in Africa.
 
Fahad Musana, a player with the army team Simba FC, is believed to have suffered heart failure while watching the game at a video hall in Bombo.
 
“He even trained with us in the morning of the fateful incident and completed the session well.” Fred Kajoba, his coach at Simba FC, said.
 
A team-mate Gerald Bagoole added: “We trained with him on Sunday morning, had lunch together. When the Premier League matches commenced, he went to watch from near his residence. He has been a passionate fan of Chelsea and would do anything for the club, apart from gambling.”
