Manchester United v Chelsea: match preview


Louis van Gaal insisted that Manchester United can catch Chelsea but victory for José Mourinho’s team at Old Trafford would see a 13-point gap opened up between the two. Diego Costa remains a doubt and Loïc Rémy is definitely ruled out, meaning Mourinho may lead the line with André Schürrle, who returns from illness. Wayne Rooney remains suspended for United.
