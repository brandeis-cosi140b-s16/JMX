Steven Gerrard confirms he will leave Liverpool: how Twitter reacted


The confirmation of Steven Gerrard‚Äôs departure from Liverpool at the end of the season has sent social media into overdrive with supporters, team-mates, players, former professionals and managers leading the tributes.
 
Liverpool got the ball rolling themselves, confirming what was widely reported on New Year‚Äôs Day, that Gerrard will be calling time on his career at Anfield in the summer, with gushing praise from the Reds‚Äô manager, Brendan Rodgers, and the club‚Äôs owners swiftly following.
    
Brendan Rodgers on Gerrard: &quot;This is an era where &#39;legend&#39; is vastly overused, but in his case it actually doesn&#39;t do him justice.&quot; #LFCicon
&mdash; Liverpool FC  (@LFC) January 2, 2015    
No less than 23 of his Liverpool team-mates were also quoted on their official website with Mario Balotelli saying: ‚ÄúWow. I think of him as being at the same level as Pirlo ‚Ä¶ Stevie can do anything, he‚Äôs an amazing player.‚Äù
 
Martin Skrtel chose a more succinct tribute, simply stating: ‚ÄòStevie is special.‚Äù
 
Gerrard‚Äôs former Liverpool midfield partner, Dietmar Hamann, was among the first to comment on Twitter.
    
An era comes to the end with SG leaving LFC. I think he made the right call. What a career,what a player.Thx for the many wonderful moments.
&mdash; Didi Hamann (@DietmarHamann) January 2, 2015    
Liverpool then quoted the man himself, who claimed it was not a decision he took lightly.
    
Gerrard: &quot;This has been the toughest decision of my life, one both me and my family have agonised over for a good deal of time.&quot; #LFCicon
&mdash; Liverpool FC  (@LFC) January 2, 2015    
A recurring theme throughout was whether Gerrard is the best player to ever play for Liverpool ‚Äì John Aldridge certainly thinks so.

While numerous former team-mates labelled Gerrard the best player they have shared a pitch with.
    
I&#39;ve been fortunate to have played with some top players in my time but Stevie g is easily the best I have played with . #gerrard #LFC

Another source of debate has been where Gerrard ranks in the best players of the Premier League era.
    
Seems Steven Gerrard is set to leave Liverpool at the end of the season. One of the finest players to have graced the PL. A top, top player.

While Michael Owen struggled to come to terms with the news.
    
Hard for the Steven Gerrard news to sink in. Amazing servant to Liverpool, arguably the best of all time. http://t.co/KBEPL3caGh

The former Swindon striker Jan Aage Fjortoft revealed that the news has not only sent shockwaves through England.
    
You know a legend is leaving when all Norwegian news agencies are headlining &quot;Gerrard&quot;/radio-stations playing You&#39;ll Never Walk Alone&#10;#lfc
&mdash; Jan Aage Fjortoft (@JanAageFjortoft) January 2, 2015    
And Manchester City Women‚Äôs and England‚Äôs Toni Duggan is hoping Gerrard, heavily linked with a move to the MLS, follows the same path as Frank Lampard.
    
Gutted! A legend is a understatement, the greatest to ever pull on a red shirt.. MLS via city please?üòÑüôè&#10;&#10;#EndOfAnEraüò• pic.twitter.com/E2lXEBtdyU

Bayern Munich‚Äôs Xabi Alonso took the Skrtel less is more approach.

While Lucas Leiva is certainly going to miss Gerrard when he goes.
    
His talent is evident on a weekly basis but I have had the absolute privilege of working with him day‚Ä¶ http://t.co/izRynVc1qI

Pepe Reina was in no doubt as to who the best ever Kop hero is.
    
Best player ever to play for @LFC !! THANKS for soooo many moments mate!! FRIEND!! CAPTAIN!! LEGEND!! pic.twitter.com/a7EikhcSlh
&mdash; Pepe Reina (@PReina25) January 2, 2015    
And another recurring theme has been to praise Gerrard the man as well as Gerrard the leader.
    
Everyone knows how good a player he is, but what I admire the most is the person behind. A true leader! Y.N.W.A pic.twitter.com/w3tveu0Fx4
