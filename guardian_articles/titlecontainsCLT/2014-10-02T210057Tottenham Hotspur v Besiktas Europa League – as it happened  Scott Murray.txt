Tottenham Hotspur v Besiktas: Europa League – as it happened | Scott Murray


One last probe by Bentaleb, one last shot by Ozyakup, and that’s that for the evening. Pain for Spurs, though Besiktas deserved at least a point. Asteras Tripoli have beaten Partizan Belgrade 2-0 and top this group, two points ahead of Besiktas and Spurs. Life has suddenly got a little tougher for Tottenham.
