Everton v Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened | Scott Murray


The managers shake hands, Martinez smiling more than Mourinho, which probably says a lot. Meanwhile Costa makes up with Howard, which is lovely to see. Chelsea celebrate a stunning win, as they leap to the top of the table. Everton, meanwhile... I’m not sure what Everton can take from that. It’s been a frustrating start to the season at Goodison all right!
