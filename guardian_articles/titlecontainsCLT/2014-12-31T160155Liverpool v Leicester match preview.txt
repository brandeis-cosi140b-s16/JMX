Liverpool v Leicester: match preview


Liverpool produced their best attacking performance of the season in Mondayâ€™s win at home to Swansea and will look to add to that here. Steven Gerrard should come back into the side having been rested against Swansea, while Raheem Sterling will continue to lead the line against a Leicester side who won for the first time in 14 at Hull on Sunday but remain at the foot of the table. Alan Smith
