Brendan Rodgers praises Daniel Sturridge after Liverpool comeback


Brendan Rodgers insists expectations still need to be handled carefully regarding Daniel Sturridge but he was delighted that the Liverpool striker is back and scoring.
 
Sturridge ended a five-month injury absence by coming off the bench to score Liverpool’s second in their 2-0 win against West Ham at Anfield after Raheem Sterling had opened the scoring.
 
The Liverpool manager is keen for the 25-year-old not to be held up as a solution to all their problems but he admits it is a relief to see him scoring again. “It was nice for him. He has been out for a long time and worked very hard,” Rodgers said.
 
“When he is in that area of the pitch he has shown he is lethal and it was a great first touch and then he has great power off both sides and it was a wonderful finish.
 
“I am delighted for him. He has come back into the fold but it is just managing that integration into the team. It was better him scoring than not scoring because if he doesn’t everyone is looking at him wondering when he will get his first goal.”
