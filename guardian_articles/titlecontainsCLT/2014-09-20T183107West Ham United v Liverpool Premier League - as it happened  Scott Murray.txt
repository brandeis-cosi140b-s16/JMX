West Ham United v Liverpool: Premier League - as it happened | Scott Murray


West Ham make off with their first home points of the season. Three of them, each and every one well deserved. They were brilliant today, from the back to the front, while Liverpool were nothing short of a ragged shambles. The recent history between these two sides counted for exactly nothing, nix, nada. West Ham leapfrog Liverpool into eighth place, their season up and running. Liverpool’s is in danger of falling apart already. Next week’s Merseyside derby looms large, and it’s not a test they’ll be relishing. As for West Ham, just a trip to Manchester United next!
