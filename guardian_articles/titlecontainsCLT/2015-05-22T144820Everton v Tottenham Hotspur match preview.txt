Everton v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview


Mauricio Pochettino will end his first season as Tottenham manager with a fifth-placed finish should his team win at Everton and Liverpool lose at Stoke, who beat Spurs comfortably on their last away outing. For Roberto Martínez, the aim is to hold on to a place in the top half after a difficult season and, possibly, give Sylvain Distin a more fitting end to a fine Everton career having frozen the veteran defender out of his plans since January. Aaron Lennon is ineligible to face his parent club. Andy Hunter
