Glen Johnson may leave Liverpool after contract talks reach deadlock


Glen Johnson has indicated he is approaching the end of his Liverpool career having admitted that talks on a contract extension at Anfield have fallen “very quiet”.
 
The 30-year-old will become a free agent next summer and is able to sign a pre-contract agreement with a foreign club from 1 January, having so far resisted the offer of a 12-month extension to his £120,000-a-week deal from Liverpool’s owners, Fenway Sports Group.
 
Liverpool’s offer arrived earlier this year but remains unsigned, with Johnson seeking a longer-term contract. The Anfield club secured fellow England international Daniel Sturridge on a new five-year deal last week and have opened negotiations with Raheem Sterling’s representatives over an enhanced and extended contract for the talented 19-year-old.
 
Asked for an update on his contract situation, Johnson replied it was: “very quiet”. He added: “I am just concentrating week by week and not thinking about it. Of course I want to stay but, like I say, I worry about this week, this week, and then next week, next week. That is how I live my life.”
 
Johnson returned from a six-week injury lay-off in Liverpool’s 2-1 win over West Bromwich Albion on Saturday and admitted he was disappointed not to have recovered ahead of England’s squad announcement for the Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia.
 
“I would have preferred the international break to have come next week so I could declare myself fit and available,” he said. “Obviously with the squad being picked last Thursday I haven’t played for six weeks so I can’t be involved. I want to go away with the England team and play again for them as well.”
