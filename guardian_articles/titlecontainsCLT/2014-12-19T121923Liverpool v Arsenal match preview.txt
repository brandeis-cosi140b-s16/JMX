Liverpool v Arsenal: match preview


Brendan Rodgers finally found respite – and an effective formation – at Bournemouth but back in the Premier League it is a case of two managers needing to convince at Anfield. Arsène Wenger will shudder at the memory of his last visit, February’s 5-1 humiliation that holed his then Premier League leaders’ title credentials and reinforced Liverpool’s own in the process. Arsenal must also improve on their last away league display at Stoke City to avoid any nasty confrontations at Lime Street Station afterwards. Andy Hunter
