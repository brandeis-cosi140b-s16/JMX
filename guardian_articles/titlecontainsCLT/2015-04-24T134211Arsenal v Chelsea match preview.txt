Arsenal v Chelsea: match preview


Arsenal have their opportunity to nibble at Chelsea’s lead, with Arsène Wenger seeking a first victory over a José Mourinho side at the 13th try, and to postpone the visitors’ coronation for another week at least. The focus will be drawn towards Cesc Fàbregas on his first return to the Emirates as a Chelsea player with Mourinho’s sales pitch having lured him from Barcelona last summer. “I promised him he’d be an important player in our project,” said the Portuguese. “And that, normally, good projects end with titles.” The home support will be pained that their former favourite is close to achieving that aim.
