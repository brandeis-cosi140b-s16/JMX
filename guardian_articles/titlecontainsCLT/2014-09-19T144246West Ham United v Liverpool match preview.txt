West Ham United v Liverpool: match preview


Liverpool were the only English team to win in the Champions League last week but their display was unconvincing, which mirrors how they have performed domestically this season. Defeat to Aston Villa was particularly painful for the Merseyside club, who will be keen to get back to winning ways against a West Ham side who have lost each of their last three home fixtures.
