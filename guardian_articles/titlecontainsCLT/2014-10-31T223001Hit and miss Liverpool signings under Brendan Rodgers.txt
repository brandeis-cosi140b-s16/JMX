Hit and miss: Liverpool signings under Brendan Rodgers

Summer 2012 
Fabio Borini, £10.5m, Roma Loaned to Sunderland after one injury-plagued season and fee agreed for transfer this summer Miss
 
Joe Allen, £15m, Swansea City Good player when not injured but has not been fit often enough to secure a regular role Undecided 
 
Oussama Assaidi, £2.4m, Heerenveen Erratic winger who joined Stoke City for a second season-long loan in the summer Miss
 
Samed Yesil, £1m, Bayer Leverkusen Striker bought for the future but has had a dreadful time with injuries Miss Nuri Sahin, loan, Real Madrid Viewed as a coup upon arrival, ushered out after six months Miss
 
 
 
 
 January 2013 
Daniel Sturridge, £12m, Chelsea Rodgers has finally unlocked the striker’s rich potential but fitness record a concern Hit
 
Philippe Coutinho, £8.5m, Inter A key part of Liverpool’s attacking game though his end product needs to improve Hit
 Summer 2013 
Luis Alberto, £6.8m, Sevilla Former Barcelona starlet made only nine senior appearances before joining Málaga on loan in summer Miss
 
Iago Aspas, £7.2m, Celta Vigo Delivered a dreadful corner against Chelsea last season. And that was it Miss
 
Simon Mignolet, £9m, Sunderland Started confidently at Anfield but failure to command his area has spread unease among defence Miss
 
Kolo Touré, free, Manchester City Experience was needed after Jamie Carragher’s retirement but Ivorian has faded rapidly after a promising opening Miss
 
Tiago Ilori, £7m, Sporting Lisbon Only 21 and not featured for Liverpool yet. Loaned to Granada last season, Bordeaux this Undecided
 
Aly Cissokho, loan, Valencia One to forget. His best appearance at Anfield came with Aston Villa this season Miss
 
Mamadou Sakho, £19m, PSG Rodgers does not appear convinced by the second most expensive defender in Liverpool’s history Miss
 
Victor Moses, loan, Chelsea Complained about a lack of playing time but never seized the opportunity when it came Miss
 Summer 2014 … the verdict so far 
Rickie Lambert, £4.5m, Soton His dream move has been one of frustration so far, with only three starts and no goals Undecided
 
Adam Lallana, £25m, Soton Missed the first month with a knee injury but improving along with his fitness Undecided
 
Emre Can, £9.8m, B Leverkusen Injured while with Germany Under-21s and so barely seen. Yet to make an impact Undecided
 
Dejan Lovren, £20m, Soton Given the big billing by Rodgers but had an awkward start. Gradually imposing himself Undecided
 
Javier Manquillo, loan, At Madrid A decent start. Willingness to support the attack won a crucial penalty against Ludogorets Undecided
 
Alberto Moreno, £12m, Sevilla Caught out on his debut at Manchester City but the tenacious, quick left-back looks the part Hit
 
Divock Origi, £9.8m, Lille Loaned back to Lille as a condition of the transfer Undecided
 
Lazar Markovic, £20m, Benfica The most disappointing of the summer intake so far. Needs time, and games, to adapt Miss
 
Mario Balotelli £16m, Milan Too early to make a call on the end-of-window signing, which is just as well for the Italian Undecided
