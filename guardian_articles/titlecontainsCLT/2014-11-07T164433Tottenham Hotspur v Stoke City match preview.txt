Tottenham Hotspur v Stoke City: match preview


Tottenham have lost three out of their last four Premier League matches at White Hart Lane, which underlines how tough it has been to establish confidence in the early months of the Mauricio Pochettino era. and Morale was particularly low during the last of those defeats, at home to Newcastle. Having racked up three wins since, with Harry Kane a scorer in each game and looking increasingly like White Hart Lane’s knight in shining armour, the clamour for the youngster to start in the Premier League is surely irresistible. Stoke have won once in the last month. Amy Lawrence
