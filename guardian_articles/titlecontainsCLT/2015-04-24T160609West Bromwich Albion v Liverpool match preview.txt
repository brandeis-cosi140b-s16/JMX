West Bromwich Albion v Liverpool: match preview


After suffering FA Cup defeat at the hands of Aston Villa last week, Liverpool face another Midlands side. Tony Pulis will have Craig Dawson available but will be without Youssouf Mulumbu and Andre Wisdom. Liverpool will want to put some distance between themselves and Spurs and Southampton in the table while the Baggies will hope to reinforce their Premier League safety. George Sandeman
