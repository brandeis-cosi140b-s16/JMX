Chelsea v Bradford City: match preview


There is a school of thought that with Wembley a home win away in the Capital One Cup and the prospect of a Champions League tie against PSG to negotiate alongside their title challenge, Chelsea may be happy to let the FA Cup go for a season. José Mourinho, however, has never been to that school. Bradford saw off Arsenal and Aston Villa to reach Wembley in the League Cup in 2013 – if the League One side were to add this scalp it would top even that achievement. Paul Chronnell
