Liverpool owner John W Henry may be in Dubai to discuss naming rights


Liverpool’s principal owner, John W Henry, has travelled to Dubai for meetings that could open up sponsorship or naming rights deals between the Anfield club and businesses in the Middle East.
 
The Boston-based billionaire has been accompanied on the trip by the former Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry, who left the club during the near-ruinous reign of George Gillett and Tom Hicks, and watched Al Wasl’s game with Ajman on Wednesday.
 
Liverpool are not believed to be the only topic on Henry’s agenda in Dubai but, with planning permission recently granted for a new £75m Main Stand at Anfield, and Fenway Sports Group increasing the club’s commercial revenue since taking over, his visit in the company of Parry raises the prospect of a new sponsorship arrangement.
 
Meanwhile, Liverpool have released three of the club’s scouts as part of an overhaul of their scouting network. Alan Harper, Mel Johnson and Mike McGlynn have all parted company with the club.
