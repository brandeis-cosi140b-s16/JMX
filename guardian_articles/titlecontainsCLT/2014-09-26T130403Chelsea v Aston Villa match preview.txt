Chelsea v Aston Villa: match preview


A week ago this would have been an intriguing top of the table contest, but Arsenal burst Aston Villa’s bubble. Paul Lambert’s squad had been affected by a virus before that first loss of the season and his players will arrive recovered, though competing with Chelsea, with Diego Costa fit and starting, will provide its own problems. The leaders have lost one league game at home to Villa in 12 years. They will be confident of remaining clear of the pack. Dominic Fifield
