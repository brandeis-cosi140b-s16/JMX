Manchester City v Chelsea: match preview


Chelsea have looked quite impressive to date, despite their surprise wobble at home to Schalke in the Champions League on Wednesday. And while Diego Costa’s hamstrings remain a worry, José Mourinho will be quietly confident of repeating last year’s result at the Etihad, where they defended brilliantly on the way to a 1-0 win. City have yet to fully flex their muscles despite drawing at Arsenal. Alan Smith
