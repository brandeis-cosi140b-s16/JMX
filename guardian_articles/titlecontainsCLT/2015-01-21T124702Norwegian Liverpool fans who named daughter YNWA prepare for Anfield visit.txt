Norwegian Liverpool fans who named daughter YNWA prepare for Anfield visit


A four-year-old Norwegian girl named YNWA by her Liverpool-supporting parents is preparing to make an emotional first visit to Anfield.
 
YNWA – named after the abbreviation to Liverpool’s You’ll Never Walk Alone anthem – has been promised the trip as a present when she turns five in May.
 
YNWA’s mother, Eirin Isabel Iversen, told the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet that when names were discussed early on in her pregnancy they quickly agreed that Gerrard was the obvious name for a boy – but the options for girls took more debate. “But when I suggested YNWA, he entirely agreed.”
 
Iversen said that at kindergarten the girl’s clothes are labeled with the name YNWA, but she has been given the opportunity to change it if she sees fit.
 
“Her full name is Karoline YNWA – we couldn’t really force her to cheer on Liverpool. But she is very proud of her name.
 
“Her father has promised her a trip to see Liverpool when she is five, so now she is looking forward to that very much. She already likes to sit with her father wearing a Liverpool shirt to watch matches.”
 
Christian Moller, chair of Norway’s Liverpool fans’ group, said this was one of several examples of Norwegian parents naming children in tribute to the club.
 
“It’s not the first time. It’s a bit unusual, perhaps, but it’s quite neutral. Among others parents to have chosen Liverpool names there was one couple who called their daughter Tia after ‘This is Anfield’.”
