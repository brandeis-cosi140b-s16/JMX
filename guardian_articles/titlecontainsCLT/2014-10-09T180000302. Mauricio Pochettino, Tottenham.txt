 Keith Hackett&apos;s verdict 
1) Apart from ordering the watering to stop if you notice in time, this is one of those situations you really cannot address during the game. So play the second half, advising both teams that the matter will be reported to the authorities afterwards. Uefa always take a very active approach on the issue, establishing pitch-watering plans on the morning of matches to try and avoid this sort of problem. Thanks to Connor Ellis. 2) The winger clearly means well, but he has forgotten the first piece of advice every youngster is given: play to the whistle. It is up to you, as referee, to stop the game if there&apos;s a serious injury. All that said, you should not just drop your suspicion about the defender&apos;s behaviour: speak to his manager and tell him you will be reporting the apparent feigned collapse. Thanks to Dan Buck. 3) A substitution is the club&apos;s decision â€“ it&apos;s really up to them to resolve it. Calm everyone down and ask them to come to an agreement quickly. If they cannot agree over who is going off, inform the manager and the captain that you will abandon the game and report them. That should focus minds. Stuart Bennett wins the shirt.
