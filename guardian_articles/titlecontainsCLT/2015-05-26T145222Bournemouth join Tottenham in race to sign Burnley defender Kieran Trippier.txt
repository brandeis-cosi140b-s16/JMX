Bournemouth join Tottenham in race to sign Burnley defender Kieran Trippier


Tottenham Hotspur will have to convince Kieran Trippier he will be given regular game time in order to secure his services, with Bournemouth having joined the race for the Burnley right-back.
 
Mauricio Pochettino is keen to buy Trippier but he faces competition from Bournemouth, whose manager Eddie Howe signed the former Manchester City player on a permanent basis in January 2012 when in charge at Turf Moor.
 
The 24-year-old has a £3.5m release clause, a relatively low sum for a defender. The former England Under-21 player, who was voted on to the Championship PFA team of the year for the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons, is tempted by a move to Spurs but also conscious England’s Kyle Walker may block his path into the first XI.
 
Walker though has been hampered by injury, his season having finished on 5 April when he suffered a foot injury in the 0-0 draw at Burnley.
 
While Trippier would be keen to play again under Howe at promoted Bournemouth, a club the size of Tottenham may appeal to his ambition. Doubts over Walker’s physical robustness – the 24-year-old managed only 21 appearances this season – could help persuade Trippier he will have a chance to establish himself in the Spurs first team.
