Manchester United’s Phil Jones back in training but unlikely to face Liverpool


Phil Jones is back in training and is targeting Manchester United’s trip to Aston Villa on Saturday week for his return, with the defender having only a remote chance of being involved against Liverpool on Sunday.
 
For Louis van Gaal to include him in the matchday 18 to face Brendan Rodgers’ side, the United manager’s squad would have to suffer more injuries and even then the prospect of Jones being involved is slim.
 
Van Gaal has stated he wants all players recovering from injury to have two weeks of full training and game-time in the reserves.
 
Jones suffered a shin complaint and last played for United on 20 October, the 2-2 draw at West Bromwich Albion.
 
In defence Van Gaal is also without Chris Smalling, who has a groin problem, and Luke Shaw, who has an ankle injury.
 
United may have Ángel di María available again following a hamstring problem, with the manager leaving the decision on the Argentinian until as late as possible.
