Crystal Palace v Liverpool: match preview


They have mockingly dubbed May’s nine-minute, three-goal capitulation as “Crystanbul” in south London and Liverpool will be haunted by memories of that evening upon Sunday’s return to Selhurst Park. The visitors have actually won only once at Palace in 20 years but, while their own season has been stodgy, they will confront hosts whose recent form is unrecognisable from that which propelled Tony Pulis’s team to safety last term. One point from five is a miserable return and they could be in tbe bottom three come kick-off. Liverpool will be after revenge. Dominic Fifield
