Tottenham Hotspur v Asteras Tripoli: Europa League – as it happened!


Who said the Europa League was boring? Spurs win and well they should have. They were the better side. Kane was very good – except when he went in goal, of course – and capped a fine performance by taking home the match ball. However, it is Lamela and his utterly outrageous rabona that will be gracing your back pages tomorrow morning. Thanks for all your emails and tweets and comments. Speak soon! Night!
