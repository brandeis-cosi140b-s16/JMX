Tottenham Hotspur v Everton: match preview


It is a curiosity that Tottenham have been at home in the Premier League after each of their Europa League ties this season but their record so far has been poor as they have lost four out of the six. They are desperate to buck the trend against Everton who also played in the Europa League on Thursday. The Merseysiders have found form and they will travel with confidence to a stadium that has held few comforts for Mauricio Pochettino. David Hytner
