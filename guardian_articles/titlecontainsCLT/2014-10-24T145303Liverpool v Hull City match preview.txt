Liverpool v Hull City: match preview


Mario Balotelli should keep his place in Liverpool’s starting lineup because of the limited options available to Brendan Rodgers, despite enduring a week of criticism after below-par performances against QPR and Real Madrid. The Italian may be encouraged by the fact Hull have shipped 10 goals in their three most recent trips to Anfield. Will this be the afternoon things fall in to place? Alan Smith
