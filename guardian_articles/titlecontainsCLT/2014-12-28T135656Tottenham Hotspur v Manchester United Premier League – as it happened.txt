Tottenham Hotspur v Manchester United: Premier League – as it happened


It’s finished Tottenham Hotspur 0-0 Manchester United. United remain third in the table, nine points behind Chelsea and six behind City, having played a game more than both teams. Tottenham are in sixth place, one point clear of Arsenal and level on points with West Ham, having also played one game more than both teams. Thanks for your time and your emails, I’ll be back later with minute-by-minute commentary of Newcastle v Everton, which kicks off at 4.15pm GMT. Otherwise, enjoy the rest of the Christmas holidays and have a great new year.
