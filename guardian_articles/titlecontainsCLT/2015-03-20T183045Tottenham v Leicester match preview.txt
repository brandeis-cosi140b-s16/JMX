Tottenham v Leicester: match preview


Mauricio Pochettino has had one of his easiest weeks at Tottenham Hotspur. All the manager has had to do is mention last Sunday’s disaster at Manchester United. It was arguably the worst performance of his tenure and the players know that it is incumbent on them to return to their true levels. Leicester won 2-1 at White Hart Lane in the FA Cup in January, but they would trade that for three points in their survival fight. David Hytner
