Burnley: Liverpool move to sign and loan Danny Ings would breach rules


Liverpool will have to wait until the summer to attempt to sign Danny Ings after Burnley pointed out their proposed January loan deal would contravene Premier League rules.
 
The Anfield club inquired about signing the 22-year-old striker before Monday’s transfer deadline and loaning him back to Burnley until the end of the season, given Sean Dyche’s refusal to sell his leading marksman while attempting to remain in the Premier League. Burnley responded by clarifying that Liverpool’s proposal is a non-starter and reiterating that Ings, who is out of contract this summer, will not be leaving in this window.
 
In a statement, Burnley’s chief executive, Lee Hoos, said: “This type of move would violate Premier League rule V7 regarding transfers so simply cannot happen.
 
“This is the last time we will be making any comment regarding the player’s future. Over the course of the window, the player himself, Sean Dyche and the chairman have made it clear he won’t be going anywhere and we consider that the end of the matter.”
 
Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur have inquired about Ings and would have to pay Burnley around £3m in compensation for the free agent this summer as he is under 24.
 
David Moyes’ Real Sociedad, however, would have to pay only £300,000 compensation under Fifa rules and could offer the difference to Ings in his salary. The promise of regular football is likely to sway the England under-21 international’s ultimate decision.
