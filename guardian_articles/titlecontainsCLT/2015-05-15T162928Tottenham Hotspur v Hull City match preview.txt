Tottenham Hotspur v Hull City: match preview


Hull City travel to Tottenham knowing that their Premier League future is now not in their own hands. However, one plus is that they cannot be relegated this weekend. Steve Bruce will tell his players that three points are essential given the form of their relegation rivals. Also they travel to Old Trafford on the final day of the season. It is obvious why Hull are favourites to be relegated. Graham Searles
