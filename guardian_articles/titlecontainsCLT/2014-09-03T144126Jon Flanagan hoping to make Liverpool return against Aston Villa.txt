Jon Flanagan hoping to make Liverpool return against Aston Villa


The Liverpool defender Jon Flanagan expects to be in contention for a recall when Aston Villa visit Anfield on 13 September.
 
The 21-year-old has not appeared for Brendan Rodgers’ team this term following a knee injury sustained in pre-season but is close to a return to full training. Flanagan, who is in line for a new contract at Liverpool, impressed as a makeshift left-back during last season’s challenge for the Premier League title, making light of Jose Enrique’s injury problems in 25 appearances for his boyhood club.
 
Competition for full-back places has increased this season with Liverpool signing Alberto Moreno and Javier Manquillo, while Enrique has now recovered from his knee trouble. And Flanagan hopes to challenge for his place next week.
 
“I don’t think it will be too long now and I think I should be back after the international break if all goes well,” said the defender. “It has been frustrating for me but I can’t dwell on it. It was tough to pick up the injury in pre-season but I’ve just got to forget about that now and push on.
 
“It’s going to be tough but I’m more determined than ever. It’s a massive season for me and I just can’t wait to get back now. There’s a lot more competition for places, which is good for us. The manager has strengthened the squad with the new signings, so I’ve got to continue to work hard and then hopefully get a chance.”
 
Rodgers last week expressed concern over Flanagan’s injury record but admitted the full-back merited a new contract at Anfield.
 
“Jon has been unfortunate with a number of injuries since before I came in,” said the Liverpool manager. “His injury record is not great but we want him to be an important member of our squad and he deserves a new deal.”
