Liverpool announce New Balance as new kit manufacturer for 2015-16


Liverpool have announced that the US sportswear company New Balance will become the club’s new kit supplier from the 2015-16 season.
 
New Balance, the parent company of the club’s current kit manufacturer, Warrior, has chosen to use its own name on the football strips that it produces in a bid to challenge Adidas and Nike in the market.
 
“We are thrilled to announce this sponsorship of one of the world’s leading sportswear brands, which is a record-breaking deal for the club,” said Liverpool’s chief commercial officer, Billy Hogan.

“Like Liverpool FC, New Balance has over 100 years of heritage and a global footprint. Not only are they well known for their technical innovation across a range of sports but they also have a presence in many countries across the world, which will all feature LFC kit. We are very excited about joining forces with them.”
 
Stoke City, Porto and Sevilla will also have their kits manufactured by the Boston-based sports manufacturer.
 
Warrior will continue to be used as a brand for lacrosse and ice hockey.
