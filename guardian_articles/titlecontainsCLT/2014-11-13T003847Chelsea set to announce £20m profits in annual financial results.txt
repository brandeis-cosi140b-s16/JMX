Chelsea set to announce £20m profits in annual financial results


Chelsea are set to announce profits of almost £20m and a record turnover of around £320m when the Premier League leaders release their annual financial results.
 
They ran up losses of more than £600m during Roman Abramovich’s first 10 years at the helm and this is only the second time in his tenure that Chelsea have been in the black; they reported profits of £1.4m in 2011-12.
 
However, by returning a profit from player sales in the last two transfer windows, with Juan Mata going to Manchester United for £37.1m in January and David Luiz for £50m to Paris Saint-Germain in the summer, the club offers more evidence that it is no longer reliant on its Russian owner to subsidise its day-to-day running.
