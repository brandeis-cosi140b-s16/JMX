Basel v Liverpool: Champions League – as it happened | Scott Murray


And to wild celebration, another English team is vanquished at St.Jakob Park. Basel are worthy winners tonight, but it wasn’t as though they had to do much; Liverpool’s defence was shaky, and their attack impotent. Last season seems a long, long time ago. Basel are ahead of Liverpool in Group B, and about to play back-to-back games against Ludogorets, who were beaten at home by Real Madrid tonight and are bottom of the table. Liverpool won’t be looking forward to the visit of the European champions after this dismal display. Daniel Sturridge, Joe Allen and Emre Can can’t come back quickly enough. And then there’s the Steven Gerrard question. Oh, the Steven Gerrard question. Brendan Rodgers has a big decision to make.
