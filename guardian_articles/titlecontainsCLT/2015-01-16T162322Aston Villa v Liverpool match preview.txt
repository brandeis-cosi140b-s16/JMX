Aston Villa v Liverpool: match preview


Aston Villa will look like easy targets to Liverpool despite being the away side and having a significantly depleted squad. Paul Lambert’s side are without a win in six league games and have not scored in their last four. Their new signing Carles Gil could make his debut from the bench and in doing so might provide Christian Benteke with some much-needed quality service in the final third. Graham Searles
