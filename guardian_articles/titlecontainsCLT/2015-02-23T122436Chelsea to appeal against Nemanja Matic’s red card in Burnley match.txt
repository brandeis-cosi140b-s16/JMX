Chelsea to appeal against Nemanja Matic’s red card in Burnley match


Chelsea will appeal against the red card shown to Nemanja Matic during Saturday’s 1-1 draw with Burnley at Stamford Bridge.
 
The Serbian midfielder was dismissed in the second half for pushing over Burnley’s Ashley Barnes after the striker had tackled him. The tackle was described by manager José Mourinho as “criminal” during a TV appearance on Sunday.
 
Chelsea have until 1pm on Tuesday to submit their evidence to the Football Association. If the appeal is unsuccessful, Matic will miss Sunday’s Capital One Cup final against Tottenham and the Premier League matches against West Ham and Southampton.
 
The FA confirmed on Monday that Barnes will not face any retrospective action over the challenge because it was seen by referee Martin Atkinson.
 
“In the vast majority of challenges for the ball, no retrospective action is taken as the incident has been seen by the match officials,” read a statement via the governing body’s official Twitter account.
 
“Retrospective action introduced as deterrent for ‘off the ball incidents’ [e.g. kicks, stamps etc.] committed out of sight of officials. Whole game in agreement that, in vast majority of cases, match officials are best-placed to deal with incidents to avoid re-refereeing.
 
“In line with this rationale, FA confirm no further action in relation to Ashley Barnes as incident was seen by the officials.”
 
As well as Mourinho’s appearance on Sky’s Goals on Sunday programme, Chelsea’s official website also published an article entitled ‘Outrage over Matic red card’ which featured a selection of journalists’ tweets over the incident.
