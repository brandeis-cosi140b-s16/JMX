Manchester United v Liverpool: Premier League – as it happened | Nick Ames


Anyway, that’s your lot for now. Well-earned win for the Dog &amp; Duck, and perhaps we’ll do this pub match lark again one Sunday. Keep your eyes open for Danny Taylor’s match report and Jamie Jackson’s Five Things – both, I believe, will be up on this site very soon. ‘Til next time, enjoy the rest of your weekend.
