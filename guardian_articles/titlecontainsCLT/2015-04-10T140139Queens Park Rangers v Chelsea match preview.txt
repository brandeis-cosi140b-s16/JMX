Queens Park Rangers v Chelsea: match preview


Queens Park Rangers should draw encouragement from four points and seven goals in two games on the road over the last week, though their more attacking approach might open the door for Chelsea to revel in the west London derby. José Mourinho has no qualms about selecting Nemanja Matic or Cesc Fàbregas, both of whom are one booking away from a two-match ban before the weekend cut-off. “We need points, we need victories, we cannot choose matches,” he said. The same applies to the hosts. Dominic Fifield
