Tottenham v Liverpool: Premier League – live!


New manager, same old story for Tottenham against Liverpool. They now trail 12-0 on aggregate in their past three matches against Brendan Rodgers’s side, who recovered impressively from their defeat to Manchester City. Goals from Raheem Sterling, Steven Gerrard and Alberto Moreno were enough for them and there was also a promising debut for Mario Balotelli, who managed to behave himself. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye.
