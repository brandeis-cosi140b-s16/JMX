Chelsea v West Bromwich Albion: match preview


With no other team yet looking compete, only injuries or complacency look likely to disrupt Chelsea’s unrelenting march toward the Premier League title. But even with a doubt hanging over the participation of Cesc Fàbregas, José Mourinho’s men are more than likely to prove too strong for Alan Irvine’s West Bromwich Albion side who have been stuttering over the last month.
