Sunderland v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview


As a former player and assistant manager at White Hart Lane, Gus Poyet would enjoy overcoming his old club on an afternoon when his defensive midfielder Lee Cattermole will want to show why he merits an England call-up. Italy&apos;s Emmanuel Giaccherini is similarly anxious to emphasise that he is no longer Sunderland&apos;s forgotten man but Mauricio Pochettino will look to outwit a fellow South American manager en route to seeing his Tottenham team atone for their 3-0 home defeat to Liverpool a fortnight ago.
