Tottenham have confirmed the signing of the Austria defender Kevin Wimmer from FC Köln.
 
As revealed by the Guardian, a fee of €6m (£4.3m) for the 22-year-old was agreed in March and his move on a five-year contract has now been announced by Spurs.
 
“SIGNED: We are delighted to announce that we have completed the signing of @kevin28wimmer from 1. FC Köln,” said a post on Tottenham’s official Twitter account on Friday.
 
Wimmer has enjoyed a breakthrough season in Germany, starting in 24 of their 25 Bundesliga matches. He becomes Tottenham’s first signing of the summer, with the club also interested in Burnley’s Kieran Trippier.
