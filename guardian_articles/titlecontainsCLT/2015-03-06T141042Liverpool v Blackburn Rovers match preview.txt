Liverpool v Blackburn Rovers: match preview


Rovers have beaten Stoke and Swansea on their run to their quarter-finalsso far and won the last FA Cup tie between these clubs 15 years ago as a second-tier side, courtesy of a late winner from Nathan Blake. But it would take a result in keeping with this season’s profound shocks to deny Brendan Rodgers a first visit to Wembley as Liverpool manager. Liverpool have not lost at Anfield since 8 November and with their fixture list clearing to roughly one game a week, the manager can field his strongest available lineups in the pursuit of both the FA Cup and a top-four finish.
