Liverpool considering move for Cameroon striker Samuel Eto’o


Liverpool are considering a move for the veteran Cameroon striker Samuel Eto’o as they look to increase Brendan Rodgers’ forward options before the transfer deadline.
 
The 33-year-old is a free agent having been released by Chelsea at the end of last season and has held talks with Ajax over a move to Amsterdam. Liverpool have not made an offer to the former Real Madrid, Barcelona and Internazionale goalscorer as yet, and are discussing several names, but Eto’o has emerged as a possible target.
 
The striker is believed to have earned £7m from his one-year deal at Stamford Bridge, an annual drop of £13m from his contract with Anzhi Makhachkala, but his wage demands are unlikely to deter Liverpool given the player’s availability on a free transfer.
 
Rodgers remains determined to add a striker to his squad before 1 September having sold Luis Suárez to Barcelona for £75m and seen a proposed £8m move for Loïc Rémy of Queens Park Rangers collapse on medical grounds.
 
Liverpool inquired about Radamel Falcao at Monaco, but were informed he would only leave the principality for Real Madrid and for an exorbitant loan fee, and are approaching the new Premier League season with an attack comprising Daniel Sturridge, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini. A £14m deal has been agreed with Sunderland for Borini, though he has been reluctant to make a permanent exit from Anfield.
