Liverpool v Crystal Palace: match preview


Rarely has a meaningless end-of-season fixture carried such emotional significance, for Liverpool supporters anyway as they prepare to give Steven Gerrard his Anfield send-off. There will be flags, there will be banners, there will be tears and maybe, just maybe, a final long-range screamer from the captain. Palace, not for the first time, will hope to spoil Liverpool’s big day. Sachin Nakrani
