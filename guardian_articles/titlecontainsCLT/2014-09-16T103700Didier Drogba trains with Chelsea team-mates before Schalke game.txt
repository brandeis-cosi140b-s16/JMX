Didier Drogba trains with Chelsea team-mates before Schalke game


Didier Drogba trained with his Chelsea team-mates at Cobham on Tuesday morning as he attempted to make a return to the Champions League with the London club in their opening Group G fixture against Schalke.
 
The Ivorian had injured his right ankle in training last Friday with the joint still swollen over the weekend. That had ruled him out of Saturday’s 4-2 win over Swansea and the management had anticipated being without the 36-year-old on Wednesday.
 
However, his presence on the pitch at Cobham would suggest he has recovered sufficiently to play a part, if required, against the Germans with Diego Costa or Loic Rémy still expected to start the game. Chelsea trained with a full complement of players as they prepared for their first group game.
 
Although he played for Galatasaray at Stamford Bridge in Europe’s elite competition last season, his last touch as a Chelsea player in the Champions League remains the penalty converted beyond Bayern Munich’s Manuel Neuer in the 2012 final which secured the club their first European Cup.
 
The Schalke captain Benedikt Höwedes has not travelled with the team to London after staying behind for tests on a hip injury.
 
The defender, who was injured in their 4-1 defeat by Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday and partially tore a hip tendon, may travel later, the club said.
