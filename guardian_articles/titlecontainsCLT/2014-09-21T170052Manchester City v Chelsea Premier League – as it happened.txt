Manchester City v Chelsea: Premier League – as it happened


So Chelsea have dropped points for the first time this season and will be kicking themselves after the way it happened. They had the game in the bag, a goal and a man up, but they didn’t do enough to kill it after they went ahead and City grew in belief, culminating in Frank Lampard’s equaliser. Jose Mourinho won’t be happy but a on the balance of play, a point is probably the right result given that City were the better side before Zabaleta’s red card. Ah well. Thanks for reading. Bye.
