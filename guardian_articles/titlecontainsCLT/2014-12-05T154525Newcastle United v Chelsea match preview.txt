Newcastle United v Chelsea: match preview


José Mourinho may be the Special One but he is still to win a Premier League game at Newcastle. Even so, St James’ Park regulars have long wondered what might have been had Sir Bobby Robson got his way and succeeded in persuading the Portuguese to go there as his assistant back in the late 1990s. Mourinho and Alan Pardew are friends but Pardew would still relish celebrating Tuesday’s fourth anniversary of his installation as Newcastle manager by ending Chelsea’s unbeaten run.
