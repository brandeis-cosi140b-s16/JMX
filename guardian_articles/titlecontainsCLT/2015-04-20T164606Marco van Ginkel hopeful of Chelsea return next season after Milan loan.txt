Marco van Ginkel hopeful of Chelsea return next season after Milan loan


Marco van Ginkel’s agent has admitted the Holland midfielder remains in the dark about whether he will return to Chelsea next season having spent this campaign on loan at Milan.
 
Van Ginkel, who moved to Stamford Bridge from Vitesse Arnhem in 2013 for around £8m, has made only three appearances for Chelsea after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury in a League Cup tie against Swindon. The 22-year-old was then loaned to Milan at the start of the season after being told by manager José Mourinho that his playing time would be limited.
 
However, Van Ginkel’s agent Karel Jansen remains hopeful the midfielder, who has two senior caps for Holland, may be able to force his way into Mourinho’s plans.
 
“We don’t know yet – his future is unclear at the moment,” Jansen told the Guardian. “He is now playing regularly for Milan but we still have to discuss next season with Chelsea. I think it will be decided next month or by the start of the transfer window. But there is no pressure.
 
“The goal for Marco is to return to Chelsea so we will see what happens. It is all dependable on what they want to do.”
 
After struggling to hold down a place in Milan’s first team, Van Ginkel has become a regular under Filippo Inzaghi. They are reported to be interested in making his deal permanent in the summer but could be put off if Chelsea attempt to recoup the full amount they paid for him.
