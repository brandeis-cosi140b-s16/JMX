Liverpool’s Mamadou Sakho out for up to four weeks with hamstring injury


Liverpool could be without Mamadou Sakho for up to four weeks after scans confirmed the extent of the hamstring injury he suffered in the FA Cup sixth-round replay win at Blackburn Rovers.
 
The France international limped out of the 1-0 victory at Ewood Park in the 28th minute and has been told he faces an extended period on the sidelines.
 
His absence will bring further defensive disruption for manager Brendan Rodgers, who has had to contend with suspensions to Martin Skrtel and Emre Can recently and remains without the Slovakia international for Monday’s Premier League home game with Newcastle United.
 
Sakho will miss the Newcastle fixture, Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley plus further Premier League matches against West Bromwich Albion, Hull City and Queens Park Rangers. The central defender is earmarked to return for the visit to Chelsea on 10 May.
 
Both Dejan Lovren and Kolo Touré, Sakho’s replacement at Blackburn, impressed in the replay and Rodgers does have Can available again following a one-match ban for his sending off at Arsenal.
