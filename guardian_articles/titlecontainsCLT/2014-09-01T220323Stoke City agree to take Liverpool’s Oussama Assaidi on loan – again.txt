Stoke City agree to take Liverpool’s Oussama Assaidi on loan – again


Stoke City have agreed a second season-long loan deal with Liverpool for Oussama Assaidi. The club had no plans to bring in another player on deadline day but felt compelled to change their stance after Peter Odemwingie picked up a serious knee injury in the 1-0 victory over Manchester City on Saturday.
 
Assaidi spent last season on loan at the Britannia Stadium, scoring four goals in 19 Premier League appearances, and Stoke had agreed a fee with Liverpool in the summer to make the deal permanent. But the player’s wage demands were too high. It is understood that Stoke will pay Liverpool a loan fee rising to £1m.
