Eden Hazard set to sign record contract at Chelsea worth £200,000 a week


Eden Hazard is on the verge of signing a new £200,000-a-week contract that would make him the highest paid player at Chelsea.
 
Hazard’s current deal does not expire until 2017 but the London club are said to have offered a new five-year contract in order to warn off any potential suitors for the player that won the PFA Young Player of the Year award last season.
 
PSG and Real Madrid have expressed an interest in the past, but Hazard’s new deal, which would approximately double his current pay package, would reflect the fact that he is now regarded as one of Chelsea’s most important players.
 
His manager José Mourinho said: “He means a lot because he’s a fantastic player. We are feeling day by day his motivation to work hard and improve. We have big hopes that he will go from the top player he is at this moment and will reach higher levels to become one of the best.
 
“He is a player who we want to keep, in spite of the fact he has a long-term contract as young as he is. It’s true Chelsea are trying to have an agreement over a new contract, and that he wants to stay and commit for a few more years. It’s a question of time. One more month, one less month, and he’ll have a new contract.”
 
Since joining from Lille for £32m in 2012, Hazard has gone on to score 34 goals in 114 appearances and this season has been given the No10 shirt which was vacated by Juan Mata in January.
 
Hazard’s new deal, which is expected to be finalised in the coming weeks, would follow other five-year contracts offered by Chelsea to César Azpilicueta and Thibaut Courtois, who has displaced Petr Cech as the first-choice goalkeeper at Stamford Bridge this season.
