Liverpool’s Jordon Ibe set to be out for four weeks with knee ligament injury


Liverpool could be without Jordon Ibe for up to four weeks after the teenager missed Sunday’s impressive defeat of Manchester City with a knee ligament injury.
 
The 19-year-old picked up the problem following last Thursday’s Europa League exit against Besiktas and is facing an extended period on the sidelines.

Ibe has made a big impact for Brendan Rodgers’ team since returning from a loan spell at Derby County in January but is expected to miss League games against Burnley, Swansea City and Manchester United, as well as Sunday’s FA Cup quarter final with Blackburn Rovers, with the untimely setback.
