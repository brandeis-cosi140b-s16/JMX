Manchester United v Tottenham Hotspur


Now is the time for Louis van Gaal and his expensive squad of highly paid players to prove their worth to Manchester United as Tottenham Hotspur’s arrival for the late Sunday game starts the campaign’s crucial phase. United stand only three points ahead of Spurs in fourth place in the “rat race”, as Van Gaal continues to call it, for a Champions League berth. Next for United are Liverpool, at Anfield, before Manchester City and Chelsea are opponents in two of the following three matches. Jamie Jackson
