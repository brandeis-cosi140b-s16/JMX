Liverpool monitor Australia goalkeeper Mathew Ryan from Club Brugge


Liverpool are monitoring the Australia goalkeeper Mathew Ryan as Brendan Rodgers considers his options for replacing Simon Mignolet.
 
Ryan, who plays for Club Brugge, has emerged as a possible transfer target for the Anfield club with Rodgers expected to be in the market for two goalkeepers this summer. The Liverpool manager has expressed concern over Mignolet’s struggle to adapt to the team’s style since his £9m move from Sunderland in 2013 and second-choice Brad Jones is out of contract at the end of the season.
 
The 22-year-old Ryan, Australia’s goalkeeper at the World Cup in Brazil, signed a new four-year contract with the Belgium club in November and is one of several candidates under consideration by Liverpool. He joined Club Brugge from Central Coast Mariners in 2013 and has impressed in his two seasons in Belgium.
 
Ryan is currently involved in the Asian Cup in Australia, where the host nation have reached the quarter-finals after a 4-0 win over Oman in Sydney, and would be a summer transfer target for Liverpool should their interest develop.
