Manchester City v Liverpool – as it happened | Jacob Steinberg


Manchester City finish this match looking thoroughly ominous. Liverpool were the better side for 40 minutes, without really creating anything, but then came a lesson in cold-blooded efficiency from City, who proceeded to run away with it after Stevan Jovetic’s opener. That’s why they’re champions. Thanks for reading and emailing. Night.
