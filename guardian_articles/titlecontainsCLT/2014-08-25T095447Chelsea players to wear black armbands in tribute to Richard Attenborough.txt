Chelsea players to wear black armbands in tribute to Richard Attenborough


Chelsea players will wear black armbands at Saturday’s visit to Everton as a mark of respect for Richard Attenborough, the club’s life president, who died on Sunday aged 90.
 
The actor and film director was a lifelong supporter and a former director at Chelsea and helped the club to stay at Stamford Bridge in the 1980s when the stadium was a target for property developers who had bought shares at the club.
 
“Chelsea Football Club is tonight deeply saddened to learn of the passing of our life president Lord Attenborough, CBE at the age of 90,” read a statement on the club’s official website. “He led a long and successful life and always found time for the things in life he loved most, one of which was Chelsea FC.
 
“Renowned throughout the world for his work in cinema which honoured him with awards for acting, directing and producing, football – and Chelsea in particular – was never far from his thoughts.
 
“He will be greatly missed, and the thoughts of everyone at Chelsea FC are with his family and friends at this sad time.”
