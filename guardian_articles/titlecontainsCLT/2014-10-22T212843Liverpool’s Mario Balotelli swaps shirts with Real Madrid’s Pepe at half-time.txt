Liverpool’s Mario Balotelli swaps shirts with Real Madrid’s Pepe at half-time


Mario Balotelli was seen swapping shirts with the Real Madrid defender Pepe as they both left the pitch at half-time with Liverpool 3-0 down in their Champions League Group B game at Anfield.
 
The Italian striker was replaced by Adam Lallana at the interval. The Liverpool manager, Brendan Rodgers, said after the game that the switch was tactical.
 
“That’s the first I’ve heard of it,” Rodgers told Sky Sports when informed of the shirt swap. “But if that’s the case then I wouldn’t like it. It’s something that I don’t like to see, I’ve seen it happen in other leagues and other countries but it’s certainly something that doesn’t happen here and shouldn’t happen. We had an incident last year here with a player, which I dealt with, and if that’s the case then I’ll deal with this as well.”
 
Balotelli has scored only once for Liverpool since joining from Milan for £16m in August – the opening goal in the 2-1 win over Ludogorets in September.
 
Rodgers said of Balotelli’s substitution: “Just tactical. I felt that we needed a bit more intensity and someone to create through the middle and occupy their centre-halves a wee bit more.
 
“Adam Lallana came on and did very, very well. Young Raheem Sterling played up there, which was difficult for him but I thought he kept working and kept trying and it’s not a natural position for him.”
 
Cristiano Ronaldo opened the scoring for Real before two Karim Benzema goals maintained the holders’ 100% start to their campaign. Liverpool are six points behind, tied on three points with Ludogorets and Basel. The Bulgarian team scored late to defeat Basel 1-0.
