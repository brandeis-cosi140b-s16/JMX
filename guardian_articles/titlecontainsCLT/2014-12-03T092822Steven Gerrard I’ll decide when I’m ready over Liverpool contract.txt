Steven Gerrard: I’ll decide when I’m ready over Liverpool contract


Steven Gerrard refused to be drawn on whether he would sign a new contract at Liverpool after scoring in the 3-1 victory over Leicester City.
 
The 34-year-old was restored to the starting lineup by manager Brendan Rodgers on Tuesday night having been dropped to the bench against Stoke on Saturday. Gerrard scored his team’s second goal at the King Power Stadium as their second successive win lifted Liverpool into the top half of the Premier League table.
 
The former England captain’s current deal at Anfield expires at the end of the season and Rodgers revealed earlier this week that he has been offered an extension. But Gerrard was unwilling to discuss whether he intends to sign it.
 
“I’ll decide when I’m ready,” he told BT Sport. “There’s nothing to say on the contract at the moment. When there is, the fans have known me long enough, I’ll come out and say what I need to say.”
 
Liverpool have now gone three matches unbeaten since losing 3-1 to Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.
 
“Over the last three performances we’ve been superb and we need to keep trying to improve on that,” said Gerrard.
 
“The reason I don’t want to answer your questions [on my contract] tonight is because it’s not about me, it’s about the performance and a great three points, and that’s what the headline should be.”
