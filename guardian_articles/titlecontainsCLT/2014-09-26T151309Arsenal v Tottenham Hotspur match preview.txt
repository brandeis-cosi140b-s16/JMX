Arsenal v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview


Mauricio Pochettino heads into his first north London derby aiming to turn around his team’s dismal record in this fixture, with Tottenham having lost on their past four visits to the Emirates Stadium. Arsène Wenger, meanwhile, faces his 12th different Spurs counterpart undefeated in the league, but smarting from a 2-1 Capital One Cup defeat by Southampton in midweek. Nick Harland
