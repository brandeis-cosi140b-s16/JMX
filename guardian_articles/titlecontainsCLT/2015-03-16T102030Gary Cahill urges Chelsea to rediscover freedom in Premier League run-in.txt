Gary Cahill urges Chelsea to rediscover freedom in Premier League run-in


Gary Cahill insists there is no need for Chelsea to panic despite the Premier League leaders missing out on the chance to extend their advantage over Manchester City on Sunday, four days after their Champions League elimination.
 
Chelsea remain unbeaten since their FA Cup defeat to Bradford in January but their elimination from the Champions League at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain last week took the shine off their League Cup success and Sunday’s 1-1 draw with Southampton did little to lift spirits, even if it took them six points clear of City in second.
 
Cahill has questioned the criticism received by the London club after their costly 2-2 draw with PSG however, and urged Chelsea to return to winning ways, starting with the trip to Hull on Sunday. “I’ve noticed playing for this club the expectations are so high sometimes,” he said. “The other night we drew. Of course we’ve gone out but we didn’t actually lose the game we drew and all of a sudden everyone is [saying] ‘what’s happening here?’ and this and that.
 
“As players we have to focus on the job in hand and the job in hand is the Premier League. It’s a massive opportunity for this season, everybody knows. [There are] 10 games left to go and we are in a fantastic position and we need to bear that in mind. We should be going out playing with freedom and not feeling pressure.
 
“We should be going out enjoying [our football] and I think that comes with winning games and the next win, I’m sure, is just around the corner for us.”
