Arsène Wenger challenges Arsenal to give Chelsea a fight next season


Arsène Wenger regarded Arsenal’s 3-1 win at Hull City as further evidence of his side’s ongoing improvement as Santi Cazorla targeted a title push next season. The victory, which effectively secures Champions League qualification, featured Alexis Sánchez scoring the team’s 100th goal of the season in all competitions and Wenger could not have been happier.
 
“I feel we have made progress as a team and tonight was a demonstration we have improved,” he said. “We played the kind of football we love to play with pace, quality and desire. Most importantly we’ve made progress since the start of the season. We’re playing a different way from September.

“We’ve passed a few positive tests. What is at stake now is to maintain our run and finish second.
 
“Chelsea are worthy winners this season because they have been the most consistent team of all. Let’s finish the season well, prepare well for next season and give them a good fight.”
 
Santi Cazorla echoed his manager’s sentiment and challenged his team‑mates to push for top spot next year. “Of course we want to win the title next year,” said the Spanish playmaker. “But second place this season is for now the most important thing. We want to finish in the Champions League places and win the FA Cup final.
 
“The team is in a good moment and we want to keep this level up until the end of the season.”
 
Arsenal’s manager was also delighted to welcome Jack Wilshere back after a five-and-a-half-month lay-off. “He was full of energy,” enthused Wenger who saw Sánchez register his 15th and 16th Premier League goals of the campaign on a night when Aaron Ramsey was on the scoresheet with the two-goal Sánchez.
