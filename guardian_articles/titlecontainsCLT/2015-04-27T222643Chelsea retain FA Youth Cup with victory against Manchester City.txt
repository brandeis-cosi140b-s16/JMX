Chelsea retain FA Youth Cup with victory against Manchester City


Chelsea won the FA Youth Cup for the second year in a row after a 5-2 aggregate victory over Manchester City. The Blues won the second leg at Stamford Bridge 2-1 on Monday night after a 3-1 victory the week before at the Academy Stadium.
 
City took a sixth-minute lead through Kelechi Iheanacho but Izzy Brown equalised in the 20th minute to take the teams in at half-time all square.
 
Then, in front of the watching Roman Abramovich, Tammy Abraham scored the winner within a minute of the second-half starting.
 
It was the fourth successive final for Joel Edwardsâ€™ side and the fourth victory in the past six years.
