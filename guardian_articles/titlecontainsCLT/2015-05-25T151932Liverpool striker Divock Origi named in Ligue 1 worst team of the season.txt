Liverpool striker Divock Origi named in Ligue 1 worst team of the season


Liverpool’s Divock Origi, the Belgium striker on loan at Lille, has had the dubious honour of being named in L’Equipe’s Ligue 1 worst team of the season.
 
Liverpool paid £10m for Origi last summer after a breakthrough season in Ligue 1 and a series of impressive performances at the World Cup but allowed him to stay at Lille in order to further his development.

Origi has scored only eight goals in 33 Ligue 1 appearances, which included a 20-game goal drought between October and March.
 
The 20-year-old will move to Anfield on a permanent basis this summer and will be looking to make an impression in a side who have struggled to score. Brendan Rodgers’s team managed 52 goals in the Premier League compared with 101 goals during 2013-14, which has partly been blamed on the departure of Luis Suárez to Barcelona and injuries to Daniel Sturridge.
