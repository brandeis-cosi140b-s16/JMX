Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe warned over future conduct


Raheem Sterling and Jordon Ibe have been reminded of the strict code of conduct that Brendan Rodgers demands at Liverpool following a meeting with the manager at Melwood.
 
Rodgers questioned Sterling’s professionalism after footage emerged of the 20-year-old taking nitrous oxide prior to Liverpool’s Premier League win over Newcastle United on Monday. Images of the England international with a shisha pipe also appeared on Sunday and Tuesday, with the 19-year-old Ibe included in the second set of photographs taken earlier this season.
 
Neither player has been fined or faces any further disciplinary action following a conversation with the Liverpool manager at the club’s training ground. But Rodgers is understood to have reminded both of their responsibilities as Liverpool first-team players and warned against any continued use of the legal highs.
 
Sterling is in line to start for Liverpool in Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa at Wembley. Ibe, however, is cup tied having appeared in the competition while on loan with Derby County in January.
