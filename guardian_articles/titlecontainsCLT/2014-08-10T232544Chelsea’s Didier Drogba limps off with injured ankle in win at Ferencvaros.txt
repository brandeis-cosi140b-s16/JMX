Chelsea’s Didier Drogba limps off with injured ankle in win at Ferencvaros


Didier Drogba limped off with an ankle injury less than half an hour into his first start since rejoining Chelsea as José Mourinho’s team came from behind to beat Ferencvaros 2-1 in a friendly.
 
The Ivorian had treatment on an ankle shortly after Zoltan Gera scored for the home side in Budapest and was replaced by Oscar after 28 minutes.
 
Ramires drew Chelsea level five minutes into the second half and Cesc Fábregas, a summer signing from Barcelona, clinched victory with a mazy run and neat finish in the 81st minute.
 
Mourinho’s team begin their Premier League campaign against Burnley.
