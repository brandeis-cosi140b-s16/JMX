Liverpool’s Rickie Lambert turns down £5m Aston Villa move


Rickie Lambert rejected a deadline-day transfer to Aston Villa despite Liverpool being prepared to cash in on the striker for £5m.
 
Liverpool initially had no intention of selling the 32-year-old eight months after his £4.5m arrival from Southampton but were tempted into a rethink by Villa’s straight cash offer. The deal would have given the Anfield club a quick profit on a striker who has been limited to only 10 starts in all competitions this season but Lambert did not want to leave the club he supported as a boy so quickly.
 
Lambert was also the subject of interest from Crystal Palace and Hull City during the January window but their approaches were thwarted by Liverpool.
 
Villa’s bid, however, was relayed to the England international but the striker informed Anfield officials he wanted to stay and fight for a place in Brendan Rodgers’ squad rather than leave.
 
Lambert, who has scored three goals in 24 appearances for Liverpool this season, signed only a two-year contract and is likely to face a similar decision over his future this summer. Lambert was signed effectively as a ‘Plan B’ by Rodgers only for his chances to be hindered by the arrival of Mario Balotelli, Fabio Borini’s refusal to join Sunderland and the manager’s decision to deploy Raheem Sterling in attack.
 
Competition will increase only at the end of this season when Divock Origi completes his £9.8m arrival from Lille and Liverpool remain hopeful of agreeing a deal with Burnley to sign Danny Ings. The England Under-21 international is out of contract this summer and Liverpool want to negotiate a fee with Burnley without having to go to a tribunal over compensation.
