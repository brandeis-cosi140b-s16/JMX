Tottenham’s Pochettino defends Christian Eriksen from ‘brutal’ criticism


Mauricio Pochettino has defended Christian Eriksen after the Tottenham Hotspur midfielder was heavily criticised by his national manager.
 
Eriksen was part of the Denmark team that lost 1-0 to Portugal in a Euro 2016 qualifier on Tuesday and Morten Olsen said: “Eriksen was not able to control the game and therefore we blame him. It’s a brutal world, otherwise you have to play at another level. He is not playing for Ajax any more, he has not developed.
 
“If he was a player at a lower level, one could say that he has no class. But it is Christian Eriksen. We must be tough and say it to him. He must stand up to the criticism.”
 
Pochettino, the Tottenham manager, was not impressed and said: “It’s not my problem. It’s his [Olsen’s] problem. My problem is to look after my player Christian Eriksen. I am very happy with his performance and with his commitment. I have never analysed what international managers have said about my players. He is a very good professional and his commitment with the team is good.”
 
Eriksen joined Tottenham from Ajax in the summer of last year for £11m. This season he has started every Premier League game and scored the winner in the 1-0 defeat of Southampton at the start of the month.
 
Pochettino said before Tottenham’s visit to Manchester City on Saturday: “He is a very good player, an important player for Tottenham. I am very happy for his performance and impact on the club and team. He is still young. He knows he needs to improve but we are very happy with him.”
 
Hugo Lloris and Nacer Chadli will have fitness tests before the trip to the Etihad. The France goalkeeper did not play against Armenia on Tuesday because of a thigh problem and Chadli missed Belgium’s 1-1 draw with Bosnia-Herzegovina with a hip complaint.
