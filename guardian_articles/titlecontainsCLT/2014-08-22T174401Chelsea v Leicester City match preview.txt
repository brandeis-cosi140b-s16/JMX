Chelsea v Leicester City: match preview


José Mourinho may have said it is “difficult” playing newly promoted sides early in the season but his team had few problems overcoming Burnley at Turf Moor on Monday night. Nigel Pearson will be hoping that his Leicester side – beaten only four times away from home in the league last season – can present more of a challenge at Stamford Bridge this afternoon, otherwise it could be another easy three points for Chelsea.
