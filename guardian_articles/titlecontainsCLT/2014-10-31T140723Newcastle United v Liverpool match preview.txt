Newcastle United v Liverpool: match preview


Alan Pardew and Brendan Rodgers are friends dating from the days when Liverpool’s manager served as Pardew’s youth team coach at Reading. Delighted as Rodgers has been to see his pal dodge the sack as Newcastle have, against all odds, won three consecutive games, he could do with a victory in what his Newcastle counterpart deems one of this division’s most “romantic” fixtures. If all eyes are on Mario Balotelli, a key sub-plot could revolve around the performances of rival wingers Raheem Sterling and Rolando Aarons. Louise Taylor
