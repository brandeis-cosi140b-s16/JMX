Tottenham and Arsenal stop fans taking selfie sticks into their grounds


Tottenham and Arsenal fans will have to take pictures of themselves without the help of selfie sticks at home matches.
 
The extendable rods for taking pictures with a smartphone or camera have been banned from the clubs’ stadiums.
 
Spurs said sticks will be confiscated from anyone trying to take them into the ground.
 
The ban emerged after a letter from a member of Tottenham’s customer care team was posted on Twitter and confirmed by the club.
 
The letter says: “Selfie sticks have now been banned from entering White Hart Lane.” An Arsenal spokesperson told the New Journal: “We can confirm that selfie sticks are banned on matchdays at Emirates Stadium. The club’s ground regulations prohibit any object that could be used as a weapon or could compromise public safety.”
