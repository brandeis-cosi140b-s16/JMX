Tottenham Hotspur v Leicester City: match preview


Tottenham were jaded in the scrappy 1-0 win against Sheffield United on Wednesday because of a taxing schedule requiring them to play nine times in January so Mauricio Pochettino is likely to shuffle his pack for this test. Nigel Pearson’s Leicester have played 12 fewer games but could do with some respite from their survival battle and will fancy their chances of capitalising on Spurs’ hectic fixture list. November 2000 was the last time one side failed to score in a meeting between these two. Alan Smith
