Stoke City v Tottenham Hotspur: match preview


Tottenham’s hopes of a top-four place were all but ended by their defeat to Manchester City, so now the race for Europa League places is on. Or should that be the race to avoid it? Fifth and sixth place will certainly qualify for Thursday night fun – but seventh will too if the FA Cup final goes to form and is won by Arsenal. Stoke are out of the running, for which they may just be thankful. Paul Chronnell
