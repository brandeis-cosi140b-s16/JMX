Everton v Liverpool: which players make our combined XI?

Everton (4-3-2-1) 
Joel Robles Has replaced the injured Tim Howard for the past seven games and been more assured and commanding than many expected 6/10
 
Séamus Coleman Not found the penetrating form of last season largely due to a disrupted defence and a lack of cover from those around him 6
 
John Stones Was coming into top form when he damaged ankle ligaments in October, resulting in a three-month lay-off, and his return has been timely 7
 
Phil Jagielka Everton’s saviour at Anfield in September suffered a difficult, post-World Cup affected start to the season but has reasserted his authority lately 7
 
Leighton Baines Like Coleman, Everton’s other full-back has often been nullified by opposing teams’ tactics and has missed the rapport with the injury-struck Steven Pienaar 6
 
Muhamed Besic The Bosnian’s popularity is growing by the week at Goodison with his tenacious, energetic displays one of the few highlights on display. James McCarthy’s return from injury will pose a dilemma for Roberto Martínez but the Scottish-born influential midfielder, who would be in the combined Mersey XI if fit, remains a doubt to start on Saturday 7
 
Gareth Barry Produced arguably his best game of the campaign in the win at Crystal Palace last weekend having previously struggled to recreate last season’s influence 5

Aiden McGeady Not had Goodison’s backing even when he was the sole source of creativity during Kevin Mirallas’s absence but capable of providing an invaluable assist 5
 
Steven Naismith Began well, tailed off towards Christmas and wasted by Martínez out on the flanks but impressing now restored to the No10 role 7
 
Kevin Mirallas The controversy over his penalty miss against West Bromwich Albion could not disguise his importance to Everton but struggled with injury this term 6
 
Romelu Lukaku Capable of excellence one game, anonymity the next, but Everton have rarely played to their record signing’s strengths this season 6
 Liverpool (3-4-2-1) 
Simon Mignolet His days as first choice appeared numbered in December but he has made an encouraging return from a spell on the bench 6/10
 
Emre Can The Germany Under-21 midfielder has impressed in Brendan Rodgers’s back three, his passing range, strength and awareness well suited to the role as he demonstrated during Wednesday’s late rescue act at Bolton Wanderers in the FA Cup 7
 
Martin Skrtel Liverpool’s most consistent and assured defender this season has relished the extra responsibility at the heart of a back three 8
 
Mamadou Sakho Stormed out of Anfield before the last Merseyside derby having been omitted from the squad. Approaches the return in the best form of his Liverpool career 8
 
Lazar Markovic Mirrors Liverpool’s campaign in many ways – ineffective and rarely seen in the opening months but looking more confident and dangerous as he settles in. Picked up a back injury at Bolton on Wednesday, however 7

Jordan Henderson Has accepted a variety of roles without complaint and sometimes to his own cost but far more influential now back in central midfield 7
 
Lucas Leiva Overlooked by Rodgers for most of 2014 but the man he turned to when in deep trouble in November. Liverpool have lost only one game in which the defensive midfielder has started since 8
 
Alberto Moreno Struggled after a bright start to his Liverpool career but beginning to adapt to a more advanced role in Rodgers’s revised system 6
 
Steven Gerrard Whether liberated by clarification over his future or the return to a more advanced role, Liverpool’s leading goalscorer this term remains a potent threat and thrives on derbies, the odd red card aside 7
 
Philippe Coutinho Two perfect assists against West Ham United last weekend showed the Brazilian with the new five-year contract is returning to form after a subdued start 8
 
Raheem Sterling Took responsibility during Liverpool’s poor start and has continued to improve as a makeshift lone striker. The quality of his creativity exceeds his finishing but, as Bolton discovered to their cost in the FA Cup replay, that part of his game is improving too 9
 
This, then, is our combined XI, based on form ahead of this weekend’s derby:
