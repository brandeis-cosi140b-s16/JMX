Stoke City v Chelsea: match preview


Chelsea banished the memory of losing to Newcastle by comprehensively beating Hull 2-0 last weekend. Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium is an entirely different prospect though, as Arsenal found out recently. José Mourinho’s side can easily match Stoke’s physical style and should have more than enough class to pick up a win and continue leading the Premier League in style. Graham Searles
