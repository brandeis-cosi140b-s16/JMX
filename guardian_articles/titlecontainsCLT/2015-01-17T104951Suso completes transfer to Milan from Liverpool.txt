Suso completes transfer to Milan from Liverpool


Liverpool have announced the departure of the midfielder Suso to Milan.
 
The 21-year-old Spaniard, whose full name is Jesús Fernández Sáez, represented Spain at every age group from Under-17 to Under-21 but he failed to make a serious impact at Anfield under the managers Kenny Dalglish or Brendan Rodgers after joining from Cádiz in 2011.
 
He made 21 appearances for Liverpool, scoring his only goal for the club against Middlesbrough in the Capital One Cup earlier this season. In 2012 the FA fined the player £10,000 and warned him about his future conduct after he called his team-mate José Enrique “gay” on Twitter. For the 2013-14 season he was loaned out to the La Liga club Almería, where he scored three goals.
 
A short statement from Liverpool read: “Everybody at Liverpool thanks Suso for his contribution and wishes him all the best for the future.”
