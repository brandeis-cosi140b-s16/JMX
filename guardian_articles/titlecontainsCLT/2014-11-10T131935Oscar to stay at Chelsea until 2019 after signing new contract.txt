Oscar to stay at Chelsea until 2019 after signing new contract



The Brazil World Cup midfielder Oscar has signed a new contract at Chelsea, keeping him at the club until 2019.
 
The 23-year-old joined Chelsea from Internacional in 2012 and has scored four goals in 15 appearances for José Mourinho’s league leaders this season.
 
“I am so happy because I love playing for Chelsea and living in England,” he told the west London club’s website. “I have enjoyed playing here for two years, and now I have five more, so I am very happy.”
 
Oscar began his career in his homeland with Sao Paulo but soon moved to Internacional where he spent two years before Roberto Di Matteoto signed him for Chelsea for just under £20m.
 
He scored twice on his first start for the club in the Champions League and helped the team to win the Europa League in 2013.
 
Oscar has also amassed 40 caps for Brazil since making his debut against Argentina in 2011 and has scored 11 times, including the only goal in the 7-1 humbling by Germany in last summer’s World Cup semi-final.
