Chelsea’s Fernando Torres set to rejoin Atlético Madrid, say reports


Fernando Torres is set to seal a move back to Atlético Madrid, according to reports in Spain.
 
The striker spent the first half of this campaign on loan at Milan from Chelsea and was due to remain with the Italian club until the end of next season, when his Stamford Bridge contract expires.
 
But he has scored only one goal in Serie A for Milan, in September, and the newspaper AS has reported that Atlético have reached an agreement with Chelsea and Milan for Torres to rejoin his boyhood club until June 2016.
 
It states that Torres will complete the move next week after Atlético’s coach, Diego Simeone, asked the club to sign the 30-year-old and that the Italy winger Alessio Cerci will go in the opposite direction to Milan. Atlético opened talked over the transfer this week.
 
Torres had a successful spell with Atlético before joining Liverpool in and continuing his impressive form. But a move to Chelsea for £50m in January 2011 failed to meet expectations, leading to his switch to Milan last summer.
