Sunderland v Liverpool: match preview


Jordan Henderson and Simon Mignolet return to Wearside on a day when Brendan Rodgers will hope to move a little closer to the European places and Gus Poyet further away from the relegation zone. The divisional draw specialists, Sunderland are difficult to beat but have won only one of their past 10 Premier League games and are likely to be without the influential Lee Cattermole. Rodgers could do with Steven Gerrard marking what seems set to be his farewell appearance in the north-east with a reminder of his match-winning talents. Louise Taylor
