Stade de Reims deny former Liverpool striker David N’Gog has gone missing


Mystery surrounds the whereabouts of the former Liverpool striker David N’Gog amid newspaper claims that the 25-year-old has vanished from his current club, Reims.
 
N’Gog joined the Ligue 1 side this summer, after stints at Liverpool, Bolton Wanderers and most recently Swansea City, and two weeks ago he suggested that his career might be entering a more successful spell as he marked his first appearance for Reims with a goal in the 2-0 victory.
 
However, he has not played since then, with Reims explaining he has been suffering from a stomach illness. The situation became murky on Friday as L’Equipe reported that the club do not know where their new striker is and were surprised to discover, when the club doctor went to see him this week, that Ngog has checked out of the hotel in which he had been living since his transfer.
 
As websites claimed the player was in Paris, Reims issued a statement that did not directly address L’Equipe’s report but did insist that his absence is down to illness. “As explained at the end of last week, David N’Gog is the victim of a virus that prevent him from training and, therefore, from plying his trade,” Reims said in a statement released on Friday following L’Equipe’s report.
 
“We remind everyone that respect for people’s private life and medical confidentiality applies to professional football as it does in every other occupation. Stade de Reims wishes him a good convalescence and speedy recovery.”
