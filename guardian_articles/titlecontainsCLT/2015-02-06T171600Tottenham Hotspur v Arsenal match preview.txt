Tottenham Hotspur v Arsenal: match preview


There were three north-London tussles last season and Arsenal won all of them while Tottenham went through another two managers. Mauricio Pochettino has been bold to play homegrown youth ahead of bigger names and has been rewarded. Both teams are on form and this promises to be another telling encounter between sides separated by one place and two points. Paul Chronnell
