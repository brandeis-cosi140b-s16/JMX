# Baseline #

create_baseline_corpus2.py and test_baseline_cross_validate.py are the final
versions of the baseline creation and testing scripts. Please use these when
testing the baseline model.

create_baseline_corpus.py and test_baseline.py remain since some of their
functions are used elsewhere. While functional, they are much slower and
give less comprehensive results.
