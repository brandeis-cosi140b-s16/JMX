        "Philippe Coutinho dealt a blow to Manchester City's Premier League title hopes with the decisive goal in Liverpool's 2-1 win at Anfield on Sunday. With Chelsea playing in the League Cup final later in the day, City could have moved within two points of the leaders, but Coutinho's stunning strike instead ensured Liverpool claimed a crucial victory in its bid for a top-four finish. After such an action-packed 45 minutes, the second half struggled to reach similar heights until Coutinho took center stage 15 minutes from time, with the Brazilian curling home from the left side of the penalty area. Lallana's first effort was saved by Joe Hart after a superb pass from Coutinho and, although the second beat the City goalkeeper, it was ruled out for offside. Coutinho was again involved as he robbed Vincent Kompany before combining with Raheem Sterling to get the ball to Henderson, with the Liverpool captain giving Hart no chance with a powerful shot into the top-right corner. That proved to be costly as Liverpool finally made its possession pay, with Coutinho cutting in from the left, evading the challenge of Samir Nasri and Pablo Zabaleta, and curling a shot past Hart to secure the win. Liverpool were supposed to be travel-weary following Europa League exertions in Istanbul yet were revitalised by Brazilian brilliance from Philippe Coutinho. Coutinho created one stunning goal for Jordan Henderson and scored another of his own to condemn Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s champions to a second damaging 2-1 defeat in six days. Rodgers did all he could to minimise the impact of Thursday\u2019s 120-minute outing against Besiktas and his decision to rest the mesmerising Coutinho in Turkey paid dividends. Central to the shift were Coutinho and Kompany. The first chance of the game set a template for much that followed as Coutinho played Adam Lallana into a gaping hole in the City defence created by Kompany\u2019s and Eliaquim Mangala\u2019s decision to track Raheem Sterling. Kompany lost out in the challenge to the slight Coutinho who broke with speed and found Sterling. The equaliser originated from a loose pass by Coutinho of all people. Coutinho was the man to oblige. Coutinho stepped inside Samir Nasri and, without needing to glance up, curled a superb shot over Hart\u2019s despairing dive into the far corner. Man of the match Philippe Coutinho (Liverpool)\n\n\n",

        "\nEarly goals from Diego Costa and Dusan Tadic ensured a 1-1 draw between Chelsea and Southampton at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. Diego Costa's fifth goal in his last six league games gave Chelsea - seeking to capitalize on Manchester City's surprise 1-0 defeat to Burnley - an early lead, although that lasted just eight minutes thanks to Dusan Tadic's penalty. However, after Mane had been brought down in the box by Nemanja Matic, who received a yellow card for his mistimed challenge, Courtois was beaten by Tadic from 12 yards despite getting a foot to the ball. The equalizer buoyed Koeman's side and the pace of Tadic, Mane and the recalled Shane Long caused John Terry's back line plenty of problems. A jinking run from Tadic failed to bring about a second for Southampton and Forster then proved the hero as he denied Willian, Hazard and Oscar in the latter stages. The penalty Nemanja Matic conceded here will almost certainly be added to his little black book of grievances as will that moment later in the first half when the referee, Mike Dean, missed Dusan Tadic clipping Branislav Ivanovic\u2019s heel when he was in Southampton\u2019s box. Mourinho\u2019s team had taken the lead in the 11th minute when Diego Costa headed in Ivanovic\u2019s cross for his first goal in eight matches but Tadic\u2019s penalty came not long afterwards and for the rest of the first half Southampton played with the kind of enterprise that is usually beyond visiting sides at Stamford Bridge.",

And Lloris was to blame for Chelsea's second goal \u2013 scored just three minutes later \u2013 after his sloppy clearance fell to Hazard. Chelsea did not play as exhilaratingly as the scoreline suggests but they were the more ruthless, efficient team by some considerable distance and there was an air of inevitability about this win as soon as Eden Hazard and Didier Drogba had scored within three minutes of one another midway through the first half. Drogba\u2019s goal was a particularly traumatic one for Spurs to concede given that it came from nothing more elaborate than Hugo Lloris miscuing a routine kick, not even getting the ball to the midway point of his own half and leaving himself hopelessly exposed as Oscar and Hazard set up the man filling in for Costa.

While Sherwood saw Ciaran Clark and Agbonlahor limp off prior to Sanchez being dismissed, the Villa boss was able to celebrate a result made all the more important by defeats for Sunderland and Hull City \u2013 both sitting below Villa in the table. Neither the missed opportunity nor Sanchez's two second-half yellow cards for tackles on Ryan Mason and Rose proved crucial as Sherwood's men moved up to 15th and took another step closer to safety. The only blow for Sherwood is that Gabriel Agbonlahor and Ciaran Clark picked up injuries that may rule them out of the FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool next Sunday, while Carlos Sanchez will be suspended at Wembley after his late red card.

Sherwood used a diamond in midfield, with Sanchez in the screening role and Jack Grealish at the tip of it, and Fabian Delph and Cleverley dominated.",

But it was Lescott's defensive colleague Craig Dawson who almost made the first telling contribution to the match, nodding narrowly over after finding himself stationed high up the pitch following a corner. Lescott was unfortunate to miss out on a debut goal when Dawson accidentally blocked his shot from close range, while Craig Gardner brought an excellent save from Hugo Lloris with a shot from distance. Spurs eventually rallied, and only a remarkable recovery tackle from Lescott prevented Adebayor from making a more positive impression at the other end moments after his fortunate escape. Irvine could revel in a clutch of excellent performances, chiefly from Morrison, the striker Saido Berahino and the centre-halves Craig Dawson and Joleon Lescott. It was remarkable to think this was not only Lescott\u2019s Albion debut but his first appearance of any description since March. Dawson looped an early header wide and he accidentally got in the way of a Lescott shot following a corner.

Fabregas produced a moment of real quality with a stunning pass into Schurrle for Chelsea's second goal after 21 minutes, and the impressive Ivanovic then tucked away the Spaniard's corner 13 minutes later. However, Burnley's shock lead did not last long, as Costa produced the kind of finish that led Chelsea to splash out a reported 32 million pounds to recruit him from Atletico Madrid with a powerful low shot into an unguarded net after Ivanovic's right-wing cross had crashed against the far post. Mourinho's men then completed a seven-minute turnaround in wonderful fashion with a mesmerising team move that saw Schurrle coolly slot home from Fabregas' sumptuous first-time pass following neat link-up play from Eden Hazard and Ivanovic. But, after playing an integral role in the first two Chelsea goals, right back Ivanovic put the visitors in command, capitalizing on sloppy marking to convert Fabregas' set piece. They took the lead four minutes later when Andre Schurrle finished off a wonderful exchange of passes and they were rampant by the time Branislav Ivanovic added the third. Chelsea\u2019s equaliser came within four minutes when Ivanovic broke forward on the right. Ivanovic turned the ball into Fabregas and the former Arsenal and Barcelona player clipped a beautifully weighted pass into Schurrle\u2019s path.

        "Two goals from Adam Lallana inspired Liverpool to a comfortable 4-1 victory over Swansea City at Anfield on Monday evening. Alberto Moreno handed Brendan Rodgers\u2019 side a halftime lead with a goal before the break, while Lukasz Fabianski gifted the hosts a second when his attempted clearance hit Lallana and looped into the net. Gylfi Sigurdsson pulled a goal back one minute later, but Lallana\u2019s superb individual effort restored Liverpool\u2019s two-goal advantage before Jonjo Shelvey headed Jordan Henderson\u2019s cross into his own net. Swansea was allowing Moreno too much space on the left in the opening stages and the Spaniard whipped in a cross that Raheem Sterling met with a first-time strike that brought a fine reflex save out of Fabianski, then Lallana fired over the crossbar following up. Fabianski was first left red-faced as he gifted Liverpool a second goal when his attempted clearance struck Lallana and looped into the net six minutes after the break. Lallana was fortunate with his first goal, but there was nothing lucky about his second as Philippe Coutinho laid the ball off to the midfielder with a deft flick and he waltzed past a couple of Swansea players before finishing with his left foot after 61 minutes. Swansea contributed to their own demise with Lukasz Fabianski handing one goal to Adam Lallana and Jonjo Shelvey completing the scoring for his former club. Liverpool\u2019s Raheem Sterling, too, may be sweating for raising a hand to his provocateur Federico Fernandez, but otherwise this was a performance to savour from the forward triumvirate of Sterling, Lallana and Philippe Coutinho. Lallana finished off the best in style, his gradual improvement indicative of that belief now flowing through the Liverpool team. The France international sent Alberto Moreno scurrying down the left, he found Lallana, who in turn released Jordan Henderson to the byline. Instead, and seemingly oblivious to the in-rushing Lallana, he attempted to sweep the ball out wide and succeeded only in hitting the Liverpool player who reeled away in delight as the ball dropped into the unguarded net. Wilfried Bony was denied an equaliser by Simon Mignolet as Rodgers\u2019 side wobbled but, with Lallana and Coutinho in confident mood, Liverpool regained absolute control. Lallana\u2019s second goal of the night, Liverpool\u2019s third, was an outstanding reminder of what last season\u2019s title challenge was based upon.",

Harry Kane rattled the post before the break as Tottenham applied some pressure, but it was Eriksen who won it for the hosts with two minutes to play. Eriksen's cross was cleared only as far as Vertonghen, whose shot inside the area took a wicked deflection off John O'Shea to wrong-foot goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon. Tottenham continued to press, as Eriksen forced a smart save from the Romanian 15 minutes later with a firm drive, before Roberto Soldado - who retained his place after the FA Cup win over Burnley - saw an effort smothered after being played in by Vertonghen's long ball. With two minutes left Tottenham's industry finally paid dividends when a wonderful counterattacking run from substitute Andros Townsend allowed him to pick out Eriksen on edge of the area, and his lashed effort clipped the post on its way in. The 32-year-old\u2019s return to the ground where he spent the best part of a decade ended with a galling defeat for Sunderland, who teeter a point above the relegation zone after falling to a late winner from Christian Eriksen.

If there was any doubt about Krul's role in Spurs' first goal, there was nowhere for the goalkeeper to hide with the second, as Eriksen's 53rd-minute free kick eluded the Dutchman's grasp and found the back of the net. However, when Gouffran carelessly lost possession in midfield, Chadli made the most of the time and space afforded to him to fire past Krul and further dampen an already muted atmosphere. It was only Newcastle's second Premier League goal in six outings, but Newcastle quickly fell behind again when Krul failed to deal with Eriksen's curled delivery. Krul atoned for his error by keeping out Kane's point-blank header, only to be beaten by the England striker's one-on-one finish in stoppage time to complete a miserable day for the home side.

Instead, it ended up as a rout, with Diego Costa at the heart of it and ironic cries of \u201cboring, boring Chelsea\u201d from the away end. Costa will probably think he should have scored a hat-trick, bearing in mind he had also run clear of Everton\u2019s defence just before that blitz of second-half goals. Mourinho could probably be forgiven for thinking his team should have made it a more routine victory considering the two-goal head start Costa and Branislav Ivanovic had given them inside the opening three minutes. Costa had a running argument with Seamus Coleman and then Howard and took out his anger with his goals. Chelsea\u2019s third goal came from a Hazard cross that Coleman deflected into his own net and that was the moment Costa apparently said something to taunt the Everton defender, bringing an incensed Howard out of his goalmouth to confront him. Costa had already been booked after ignoring the referee Jon Moss\u2019s instructions to stop tangling with Coleman at a free-kick. Howard was shown a yellow card and for the rest of the match Costa seemed intent on prolonging the argument with Everton\u2019s goalkeeper. Mikel showed him how to do it, leaving Costa running clear before taking the ball around Howard to complete the scoring.\n\n\n",

        "\nA first Liverpool goal in almost two months from Raheem Sterling helped settle Monday's Premier League encounter against Newcastle United. Raheem Sterling proved his worth to Liverpool amidst a much-discussed contract saga by scoring in Monday's 2-0 win over Newcastle United at Anfield. Sterling's future and his apparent demands have dominated the back pages of late, but the 20-year-old scored in the Premier League for the time since February before Joe Allen sealed the points 20 minutes from time. Following back-to-back league defeats against Manchester United and Arsenal, Liverpool was given an ideal start when Sterling curled home nine minutes in. While Newcastle improved after the break, Sterling should have put the game to bed before the hour as he conspired to miss from close range as Liverpool's profligate finishing continued to frustrate the home faithful. Sterling offered a timely reminder of his prodigious talent as he brought down Jordan Henderson's delivery before breezing past half-hearted challenges from Daryl Janmaat and Gabriel Obertan and curling a strike past the helpless Tim Krul. Sterling then missed a gilt-edged opportunity shortly before the hour as he managed to place an effort wide with the goal at his mercy following a defensive howler from Ryan Taylor. The Welshman duly fired past Krul to seal the points, with Sterling coming close to a second shortly after. \nLiverpool 2-0 Newcastle United | Premier League match report\n\n\nWhatever Raheem Sterling is smoking, and it is quite a lot judging by pictures that have emerged of the Liverpool forward in recent days, it proved too much for Newcastle United to stomach as their malaise deepened at Anfield. Liverpool closed to within four points of fourth-placed Manchester City with an ultimately comfortable win courtesy of Sterling\u2019s seventh league goal of the campaign and Joe Allen\u2019s first. Footage of Sterling seeming to pass out having apparently taken nitrous oxide were a distraction to Rodgers in his post-match press conference but not his team\u2019s revived pursuit of Champions League qualification. Liverpool were often careless in possession but always dangerous in attack and Sterling should really have finished on a hat-trick. The performances of Philippe Coutinho and Sterling, forming a three-pronged attack alongside Jordon Ibe, ensured the injured Daniel Sturridge was not missed. The breakthrough was a moment to savour for the scrutinised Sterling. Sterling stepped inside one weak challenge from Taylor, a second from Obertan and swept a fine right-footed finish beyond Tim Krul. Any concerns Sterling might have had over the Kop\u2019s reaction were misplaced although the home supporters were quick to express an unflattering opinion of the player\u2019s agent, Aidy Ward. Liverpool, wearing black armbands before the 26th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster on Wednesday, appeared on course for a comfortable victory in the immediate aftermath of Sterling\u2019s goal as Newcastle\u2019s resistance evaporated. Sterling should have scored his second when Taylor completely missed Henderson\u2019s cross from the right and allowed the ball to reach the winger standing six yards in front of goal. Somehow Sterling side-footed his effort horribly wide.",

        "\nThis season's leading Premier League goal scorer Sergio Aguero was on target again as Manchester City beat Tottenham at White Hart Lane. Sergio Aguero was the scourge of Tottenham once again as Manchester City won 1-0 at White Hart Lane on the day the side was dethroned as Premier League champion by Chelsea. Tottenham had chances, but was thwarted by an inspired Joe Hart as the club failed to build on a bright start and its hopes of securing a UEFA Champions League spot are now practically over, while City is three points clear of Arsenal - which plays Hull City on Monday. Hart captained City in the absence of injured duo Vincent Kompany and Yaya Toure, while James Milner and Fernandinho returned to the starting lineup. Fernandinho's goal-bound shot was blocked by Rose before firing wide when Silva set him up, but City was indebted to a great Hart save to deny Ryan Mason from close range two minutes before the break. Hart again came to City's rescue on the hour mark when he stood up to thwart Kane, who evaded Martin Demichelis to race clear but was unable to apply the finish. Samir Nasri lasted only three minutes after replacing Frank Lampard before limping off with an injury, while Hart produced two fine saves late on to keep out Erik Lamela as City sealed a third win a row. They got the job done here to end a damaging run of five consecutive away defeats but it spoke volumes that the goalkeeper, Joe Hart, ran Aguero close for the man of the match award. Mauricio Pochettino cursed Tottenham\u2019s wastefulness in front of goal and a draw would not have been unfair but Hart made a clutch of important saves, most notably blocks from Ryan Mason and Harry Kane, and the injury-time reaction stop to keep out Erik Lamela\u2019s acrobatic volley. Mason\u2019s chance on 45 minutes was glorious but Hart was out quickly to block. Kane robbed Martin Demichelis only for Hart to crowd him out and block while Aguero took Fernandinho\u2019s cross around Lloris but, off-balance, he could not finish. Soldado saw a shot blocked while Hart denied the substitute, Paulinho, and, at the very end, Lamela.",

Mirallas was withdrawn with an apparent hamstring injury in the 31st minute, Aiden McGeady taking his place, and Liverpool went close again before the break as Sterling forced Howard into action at his near post. Strong defending from James McCarthy prevented Markovic from capitalizing on a glorious Sterling through ball early in the second half. Treading a fine line after picking up an early booking for a foul on Lallana, Barry also gave away the free-kick against Balotelli and was lucky not to concede a penalty when Raheem Sterling\u2019s rising shot struck his upraised arm. Wide out on the left, Sterling was not as involved in the game as much as Liverpool would have liked, though he had the best chance of opening the scoring in the first half right on the stroke of the interval. Barry uncharacteristically gave the ball away on halfway, inviting Henderson to break forward and find Sterling advancing into the area, but Howard once again came to Everton\u2019s rescue by keeping out an angled shot. Howard was relieved Liverpool did not extend their lead two minutes later when Balotelli\u2019s effort from Sterling\u2019s cross struck his bar, a miss that Liverpool only started to rue in the first minute of added time when Jagielka stepped up to claim his place in derby history.\n\n\n",

Courtois' opposite number, Joe Hart, made his first save of the match from an Oscar effort after an error by Vincent Kompany let Remy escape down the left flank. That was a chance the Argentina striker would regret 10 minutes later, as Eden Hazard brilliantly steered Ivanovic's flighted pass back across goal for Remy to convert. As it turned out, Costa was not too badly missed bearing in mind his replacement, Loic Remy, scored Chelsea\u2019a goal. Related: Chelsea\u2019s squad leaves doubts but Manchester City could learn from their hard noses | Jacob Steinberg \n   \nManuel Pellegrini\u2019s side could not add to David Silva\u2019s equaliser but they should head back to Manchester feeling encouraged by the pattern of the game and what it said, after 87 minutes, when Mourinho signalled for Remy to come off and brought on Gary Cahill to strengthen their lines of defence. Related: Sergio Aguero provides the guile to keep Manchester City in title chase | Barney Ronay \n   \nChelsea, to give them their due, did start to cut out the defensive lapses as the game went on but they needed to because their opponents were throwing everything at them in those stages and, if anything, seemed encouraged by the message that Mourinho\u2019s Remy-Cahill switch sent out. Kompany withdrew his leg at the crucial moment, perhaps fearing that he might turn the ball into his own goal, and in hindsight he probably should have taken the risk with Remy lurking behind him to fire past Joe Hart.",

It took just three minutes of the second half for Spurs to take the lead, though, as Harry Kane gave Pochettino's men the advantage. The striker, who has proven his goalscoring credentials in the first-team this season, capitalized after Nacer Chadli lost the ball, which was gleefully claimed by Kane, who arrowed his shot low past Julian Speroni.

Creator-in-chief Fabregas showed great vision to play a delicate chip into the path of Hazard in the left channel, who cut inside Belgium colleague Toby Alderweireld and bent a fierce shot into the far corner. Fabregas was again involved 10 minutes after the break when he was tripped inside the penalty area by teenage fullback Targett \u2014 making his first league start in place of Chelsea loanee Ryan Bertrand \u2014 but referee Anthony Taylor deemed it a dive and booked the incredulous Spaniard. The visitors continued to press and Fabregas once again teed up Hazard on the hour, but this time he flashed wide of the right-hand post, while Didier Drogba was introduced to add muscle to Chelsea's attack. Cesc Fabregas and Eden Hazard played virtually every pass in those 45 minutes apart from the killer one and their frustrations did not stop there on a day when two bookable offences by Morgan Schneiderlin meant Southampton had to get through the last couple of minutes of normal time, plus another four for stoppages, a man down. Fabregas was disgusted with the yellow card that the referee, Anthony Taylor, showed him early in the second half and the replays supported his case. Schneiderlin and Victor Wanyama were quick to the ball and strong in the tackle, preventing Fabregas and Nemanja Matic from dominating the midfield in the way that happened after the interval. Targett is a 19-year-old left-back of rich promise on this evidence, even if he was grateful to be given the benefit of the doubt after the incident that led to Fabregas\u2019s booking when it could conceivably have been a penalty decision. There was clear contact between the two players even if Southampton could argue it was Fabregas moving into his opponent rather than the other way round. Chelsea took their time to get going but the pattern of the game changed in first-half stoppage time when Fabregas lifted the ball into the path of Hazard, running through the inside-left channel, and the Belgian was set free for the first time. Diego Costa had one of his least productive games and, for all the menace of Hazard and Fabregas, Fraser Forster in Southampton\u2019s goal was surprisingly underworked given how much time the ball spent in and around his penalty area. Costa lost his footing when he had the opportunity to run clear and the home side held on after Schneiderlin\u2019s foul on Fabregas, following an earlier booking for one on Hazard, left them a man down during the final exchanges.

Ex-Southampton man Dejan Lovren was one of two new Liverpool signings included from the beginning, alongside Javier Manquillo, while wantaway midfielder Schneiderlin started alongside four fresh faces for the visitors, who won the corresponding fixture last season. However, Liverpool goalkeeper Mignolet was alert to the danger and was also called into action on the stroke of halftime, doing well to tip a fizzing Schneiderlin effort over. A poacher\u2019s goal from Sturridge plus a superb 88th-minute save from Mignolet, who tipped Morgan Schneiderlin\u2019s goal-bound volley on to the bar to preserve a slender lead, left Southampton lamenting an undeserved defeat. Among the unspoken concerns must be how Schneiderlin, Victor Wanyama and Steven Davis dominated Liverpool\u2019s central midfield and restricted the home side\u2019s threat. Schneiderlin has made no secret of his desire to follow Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw, Rickie Lambert, Calum Chambers and Dejan Lovren out of St Mary\u2019s. The England midfielder powered through a 50-50 with Schneiderlin and sent Raheem Sterling scurrying clear of Nathaniel Clyne with an exquisite left-footed pass. The Liverpool goalkeeper also tipped over from Schneiderlin and, though Sterling tested Forster again on the stroke of half-time, the visitors\u2019 equaliser early in the second half was thoroughly deserved and superbly executed too.

        "\nChelsea snatched a 1-0 Premier League win at QPR on Sunday, with Cesc Fabregas scoring a late winner for the leader. Cesc Fabregas scored with Chelsea's first shot on target two minutes from time to snatch a 1-0 victory at local rival QPR on Sunday. However, Fabregas - wearing a protective face mask after breaking his nose against Stoke City last weekend - drilled home a late winner to cruelly deny Chris Ramsey's side a valuable point in the fight against relegation. But Fabregas, whose former club Arsenal is now Chelsea's main title rival, had the final say, re-establishing a seven-point advantage at the top with his side's 100th goal in all competitions this season. Fabregas headed over from close range before the half was up to leave the game goalless at the break. Phillips' shot from 12 yards out after 64 minutes perhaps represented QPR's best chance to snatch all three points and Fabregas pounced to punish that wasted opportunity. A poor Green clearance invited pressure onto the home defense and, teed up by Eden Hazard on his 100th Premier League appearance, Fabregas sent a low strike into the bottom left-hand corner to seal the win. The Belgian was permitted to exchange passes with Oscar, the home defence suddenly ramshackle, before pulling back for Cesc Fabregas to place the game\u2019s only goal inside the post.

        "After falling behind to a stunning early strike from Burnley midfielder Scott Arfield, Jose Mourinho's side slipped through the gears to dish out a top-flight lesson to its newly promoted hosts - with new signings Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas shining. Striker Costa opened his Premier League account with an equalizer just three minutes after Arfield's opener, and former Arsenal captain Fabregas assisted goals for Andre Schurrle and Branislav Ivanovic before the break. Fabregas produced a moment of real quality with a stunning pass into Schurrle for Chelsea's second goal after 21 minutes, and the impressive Ivanovic then tucked away the Spaniard's corner 13 minutes later. Mourinho's men then completed a seven-minute turnaround in wonderful fashion with a mesmerising team move that saw Schurrle coolly slot home from Fabregas' sumptuous first-time pass following neat link-up play from Eden Hazard and Ivanovic. But, after playing an integral role in the first two Chelsea goals, right back Ivanovic put the visitors in command, capitalizing on sloppy marking to convert Fabregas' set piece. Cesc Fabregas was superb on his re-introduction to English football and there was a vibrancy to Chelsea\u2019s attacking that was not always evident last season. Chelsea still left the clear impression that the arrival of Costa and, in particular, Fabregas had already improved them. Ivanovic turned the ball into Fabregas and the former Arsenal and Barcelona player clipped a beautifully weighted pass into Schurrle\u2019s path. Costa looked appalled, as strikers always do in those moments, but it was only a passing irritation and within three minutes Fabregas had swung over a corner from the left for Ivanovic to volley in Chelsea\u2019s third goal.",

The goal was Terry\u2019s 39th in the Premier League, establishing him as the highest scoring defender in the revamped top flight. A poor challenge.\u201d Andre Marriner had actually flashed a red card at Mikel John Obi, so off the pace had he been in that opening minute, before correcting that to a lenient yellow for Fabregas.",

Schurrle headed over when a previously low-key Hazard shimmied his way to the byline, before Mahrez's own nifty footwork left Cesar Azpilicueta in his wake and created enough room for the winger to fire in a rasping 32nd-minute drive that Courtois had to beat away to safety. Courtois then found himself back in action to keep out Nugent's deflected attempt on the counter-attack, although the sight of Schurrle curling a shot over the crossbar underlined Chelsea's continued threat.

At times in the first half, the most visible attacker on the pitch was Leicester\u2019s Algerian World Cup winger Riyad Mahrez, who had the first really venomous attempt on goal, after 22 minutes, making space 30 yards out and firing in a low shot that Thibaut Courtois parried away. With 53 minutes gone (and moments after Oscar had hit the post at the other end), a pass from Hammond put Nugent in on goal, only for Courtois to make a fine low save with his legs. Moments later, it was Nugent v Courtois II, a better chance drawing a better save as Mahrez bypassed the entire Chelsea midfield with a single pass on the break, Nugent hared in on goal and Chelsea\u2019s goalkeeper sprinted out to hurl himself at his feet and deflect a hesitant shot wide.",

Mario Balotelli, making his first league start for five months, showed why he is not that man, on a day when Steven Gerrard\u2019s 500th Premier League appearance for Liverpool turned into something of a nonevent. As for Gerrard, the 34-year-old spent the afternoon patrolling the area in front of the back four, watching Liverpool dominate the ball but struggle time and again to break Tony Pulis\u2019s team down.

Both sides looked dangerous going forward and Soldado somehow failed to hit the target with a header from close range after Christian Eriksen's shot had deflected into his path. The lively N'Zogbia then cut the ball back for an unmarked Benteke, who took a touch before unleashing a venomous left-foot strike that rattled the post.

There was no real malice or physical force behind Benteke\u2019s actions but the striker was playing with fire and the consequences for Villa were dire. Neil Swarbrick had little option but to send the Villa striker off \u2013 only the referee knows why Mason escaped similar punishment for putting his head into Benteke\u2019s face in the lead-up to that incident \u2013 and the complexion of the game completely changed. This latest defeat was particularly hard for Paul Lambert to stomach because of the way the match slipped through his players\u2019 fingers as a result of the Benteke dismissal. The Villa manager said that while he understood Benteke\u2019s reaction, given the striker had been provoked, he could not condone his player\u2019s actions. Not long afterwards came the Benteke red card. The Spurs midfielder took exception to Benteke\u2019s behaviour and squared up to him, going head to head. It was at that point that Benteke snapped, lifted his right hand and swiped Mason in the face. A melee ensued before Swarbrick eventually brought some order and dismissed Benteke. Vulnerable at the back, where Benteke caused Younes Kaboul no end of problems in the first half, devoid of ideas in midfield \u2013 Pochettino withdrew Christian Eriksen at half-time \u2013 and toothless up front before Kane\u2019s introduction, Spurs have plenty of work to do on this evidence.

A diving header from the marauding Matt Lowton\u2019s cross should have been buried but drifted wide and two minutes later Benteke struck a left-footed shot from the edge of the penalty area against the angle of crossbar and post.",

        "Chelsea needed a late Eden Hazard penalty to maintain its unblemished home record in the Premier League as the Blues beat QPR 2-1. However, after Hazard was clumsily bundled over by Eduardo Vargas, the Belgian stroked home the winner to maintain Chelsea's four-point lead at the summit. With an under-par Chelsea on course to drop points for the second league game running, Vargas collided with Hazard just inside the area with referee Mike Jones pointing to the spot. Hazard then had the final say 15 minutes from time as he tucked away the penalty to ensure Chelsea clinched maximum points and denied Harry Redknapp what would have been an impressive draw. Hazard almost doubled Chelsea's advantage early in the second half but failed to make contact with Willian's inviting cross as Redknapp opted to bring on Zamora for Hoilett just short of the hour mark. Mourinho then opted for an attacking change as Didier Drogba replaced Willian, but it was the ever-dangerous Hazard who was the match-winner. Eden Hazard was seeing plenty of the ball and producing some sumptuous touches but not penetrating. Willian might have soothed his manager by setting up a killer second goal in the 54th minute but instead over-hit an intended pass to Hazard, who lunged but could not connect with the ball seven yards from goal. In the end Chelsea needed help to secure the win \u2013 and, not for the first time this season, Redknapp\u2019s men came to their opponent\u2019s aid, Vargas giving away a penalty with a witless shunt on Hazard in the 75th minute.

        "Diego Costa continued his seamless introduction to the Premier League with his second goal in a week as Chelsea beat Leicester City 2-0. Jose Mourinho's title hopeful turned in a dazzling display to beat Burnley 3-1 in the club's opening fixture, with Spaniard Costa starring, but found another newly promoted team a far tougher nut to crack on Saturday. Following a low-key first half, Mourinho's decision to push his fullbacks forward after the interval paid dividends, with Branislav Ivanovic creating a scruffy 63rd-minute goal for Costa to break the deadlock. The home side pushed forward early on and Cesc Fabregas - who had performed a star turn on his debut at Burnley - played in Costa to set up Andre Schurrle in the eighth minute, but the Germany international shot over. The impressive Mahrez was guilty of overplaying as Azpilicueta snuffed out another promising attack and Chelsea responded, with City center back Wes Morgan flinging himself forward to divert Costa's 36th-minute strike over the crossbar. Oscar sent Ivanovic racing into the City box and he found Costa, who scrambled the ball home under pressure. \nChelsea 2-0 Leicester City | Premier League match report\n\n\nIf Chelsea made slightly heavy weather of victory in their first home Premier League fixture of the season, then there was plenty for Jose Mourinho to take heart from in a 2-0 defeat of Leicester City pegged out around second-half goals from Diego Costa and Eden Hazard, and a performance that became more convincing as Leicester\u2019s energy levels dropped in the afternoon sun. But it\u2019s a pretty good place to start, and it is in this kind of fixture that the added cutting edge of Costa might just make the most obvious difference. Mourinho, who also confirmed that Fernando Torres would not be leaving in the transfer window, said Costa\u2019s integration at Chelsea had been \u201cno big deal\u201d.

Amazingly, the early drama continued as Howard raced out to collect Eden Hazard's searching long ball and handled outside his area, but the American goalkeeper escaped punishment. Phil Jagielka's careless pass inside his own half almost sent Everton back to square one within seven minutes of the restart, but Costa was thwarted by Howard after racing through on goal.

        "\nThe Ivorian notched a goal and an assist as Jose Mourinho's men put their London rival to the sword in the first half, with substitute Loic Remy striking after the break\n\nDidier Drogba and Loic Remy stepped up in the absence of Diego Costa as Chelsea maintained its six-point lead at the top of the Premier League with a comfortable 3-0 win over Tottenham. Chelsea legend Drogba, who returned to the club from Galatasaray in July, led the line superbly as Jose Mourinho's unbeaten side overcame a bright start from the visitors to win convincingly. Eden Hazard set Chelsea on its way in the 19th minute before Drogba netted less than 180 seconds later for his second league goal of the season. Substitute Loic Remy, who replaced Drogba, sealed the convincing home win 17 minutes from time as Tottenham's winless run at Chelsea \u2013 which dates back to 1990 \u2013 continued. Hazard played a neat one-two with Drogba and the Belgian glided past three Tottenham players before shooting under Lloris from a tight angle. He fed Oscar and the Brazilian's excellent ball played in Drogba, who beat Jan Vertonghen and took two touches before slotting home. Chelsea dropped the tempo slightly following Drogba's strike, happy with its two-goal lead, but Willian shot twice at Lloris as the first half winded down. The best Spurs could muster, though, was a tame Christian Eriksen shot from distance, and a wayward Vertonghen header, before Drogba came off to a healthy ovation. Chelsea did not play as exhilaratingly as the scoreline suggests but they were the more ruthless, efficient team by some considerable distance and there was an air of inevitability about this win as soon as Eden Hazard and Didier Drogba had scored within three minutes of one another midway through the first half. Loic Remy, a second-half substitute, added a stylish third shortly after replacing Drogba and the Premier League leaders, maintaining their six-point advantage over Manchester City, have equalled their record of 23 successive matches unbeaten, set previously in 2007 and 2009. Chelsea\u2019s manager, Jose Mourinho, acclaimed Drogba, who is three months short of his 37th birthday, as \u201cremarkable\u201d and the only downside for Chelsea came in the form of the yellow card that means Nemanja Matic will be suspended from Saturday\u2019s game at Newcastle. Drogba\u2019s goal was a particularly traumatic one for Spurs to concede given that it came from nothing more elaborate than Hugo Lloris miscuing a routine kick, not even getting the ball to the midway point of his own half and leaving himself hopelessly exposed as Oscar and Hazard set up the man filling in for Costa. Drogba might not be the player he once was but this was a gift and Lloris took a long time to shake his head clear. Hazard\u2019s speed and movement makes him a dangerously elusive player but there was nothing particularly original about the one-two with Drogba that created the opening goal.",

        "Rickie Lambert looked to have bundled a header over the line for his first Liverpool goal toward the end, but the last touch came off Pablo Zabaleta for an own goal, though City were nonetheless able to hold out for the win. Zabaleta's recall for City enabled Gael Clichy to revert to left back, and the 29-year-old was at the heart of the host's good early play. Liverpool, which has now won only once in its last nine visits to City, grabbed a consolation with seven minutes to play as Zabaleta nudged the ball into his own goal. They had been the better side until Jovetic\u2019s first goal, five minutes before the break, but they never played with the menace that was associated with Liverpool last season and did not threaten Joe Hart\u2019s goal with any sustained momentum until a header from their substitute, Rickie Lambert, came back off the goalkeeper and went in off Pablo Zabaleta seven minutes from the end. City\u2019s home record over the last three seasons incorporates only three defeats but Rodgers always sets up his side to take the game to the opposition and that meant Zabaleta and Gael Clichy, City\u2019s overlapping full-backs, were reluctant to break forward as much as usual. Clichy, in particular, had to worry about the pace and directness of Raheem Sterling but one of City\u2019s great strengths is the way they gang up on the opposition full-backs in wide positions and it was noticeable that when Zabaleta did start venturing forward more regularly it helped Jovetic to his second goal, turning in Samir Nasri\u2019s pass from the right.",

Mignolet continued to look nervy, but was able to keep the home side at bay as Burnley's four-match unbeaten run at home came to an end. Having seemingly picked up an injury, Jones then departed the action and was replaced by the shaky Mignolet.

Striker Costa opened his Premier League account with an equalizer just three minutes after Arfield's opener, and former Arsenal captain Fabregas assisted goals for Andre Schurrle and Branislav Ivanovic before the break. Thibaut Courtois made his debut in the Chelsea goal after being selected ahead of long-term number one Petr Cech, but the Belgium international could do little to prevent Arfield from rewarding Burnley for an impressive start in the 14th minute. Burnley came into the second half with renewed vigor and immediately came close to halving the deficit when Courtois tipped Arfield's long-range drive over the crossbar. Burnley had taken the lead and, briefly, their supporters must have dared wonder whether they would be talking about Scott Arfield\u2019s goal in years to come with the fondness they reserve for Robbie Blake\u2019s finest moment for the club. \u201cOur Turf,\u201d was the message in the claret and blue mosaic in the Jimmy McIlroy Stand and Arfield\u2019s 14th-minute strike fleetingly raised the possibility of another shock.

But more sizable holes in Tottenham's defensive setup were soon apparent as Carrick strode into midfield unchallenged to play a measured through ball that Fellaini steered across Hugo Lloris and into the bottom corner in the ninth minute. Roles were reversed 10 minutes later when Fellaini's attempt from Mata's in-swinging corner was partially cleared and Carrick calmly picked his spot with a fine header against his former club. The alarm bells rung were turned up higher when the ensuing corner had to be scrambled away by Marouane Fellaini and the thought arose that this could be another painful outing for United. Fellaini revealed that Rooney had given a rousing speech to the players at the team hotel on Saturday that was \u201cvery important\u201d and had inspired the squad.

        "Phil Bardsley \u2013 already booked for a lunging challenge on Eden Hazard earlier in the half - might have counted himself lucky to still be involved at the break after avoiding a second yellow card for an apparent tug on the shirt of Costa. Asmir Begovic did well to get down to his right to keep out a Willian strike early in the second period before clinging onto a soft Fabregas strike after Hazard had managed to force the ball into the six-yard box. However, Fabregas had the final say, diverting the ball into the back of the net after being played in by Hazard, who limped off late on after a tackle from Jonathan Walters, although there was an element of fortune about his finish. Diego Costa could afford to have an off night on an evening when Fabregas showed some lovely touches in midfield, Eden Hazard stood up to Phil Bardsley\u2019s early attempts to rough him up and Nemanja Matic was the outstanding player on the pitch. Stoke looked rather flat in the early stages and it was not until after Bardsley clattered into Hazard on the touchline, earning a yellow card that could easily have been red, that the home team roused. Hazard, who had sportingly kicked the ball out of play when Bardsley was down injured not long after the Stoke right-back had put him into touch \u2013 \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it for a guy who kicked me,\u201d Mourinho said, smiling \u2013 picked out Fabregas in the Stoke penalty area.",

        "\nChelsea was left to rue the non-award of what seemed a certain penalty for a foul on Oscar in Sunday's 0-0 draw with Arsenal. The most  prominent involved David Ospina's clumsy first-half collision with Oscar in a keenly-contested stalemate that saw Cesc Fabregas booed on his return to his former club and Jose Mourinho maintain his unbeaten record against Arsene Wenger. With Diego Costa and Loic Remy injured, Oscar began as the figurehead of Chelsea's attack and was central to the game's biggest talking point as he touched a ball past the onrushing David Ospina. Arsenal edged the initial stages, although Chelsea felt it should have earned an early penalty seven minutes in when Oscar went down under pressure from Bellerin. Bellerin was then required to clear Oscar's goal-bound effort following a sublime ball from Fabregas, with Ospina's foul on the forward failing to merit sanctions. Mourinho was left distinctly unimpressed at the lack of a penalty or a card for the Colombian, although Oscar was able to continue after medical assistance. Mourinho replaced Oscar with Didier Drogba at the break and the Chelsea boss saw his side play its part in an open start to the second period. David Ospina, Arsenal\u2019s goalkeeper, was certainly fortunate not to be punished after charging from his goalline, missing the ball and clattering into Oscar. Hector Bellerin prevented Oscar\u2019s looping effort from bouncing into the goal and Chelsea had every right to argue it should have been a penalty. Oscar can just about be given the benefit of the doubt after an optimistic fall in front of Bellerin but Cesc Fabregas deserved all the condemnation that came his way when he wafted his leg in the direction of Santi Cazorla, then plopped to the ground in the vain hope that the referee, Michael Oliver, might be conned. Fabregas\u2019s pass for Oscar\u2019s opportunity was the outstanding moment and, seven minutes before the interval, Ramires ought to have done better after Willian\u2019s pass. Oscar had to go off at half-time, taken to hospital and still suffering the effects of the collision with Ospina, and Didier Drogba took over as their centre-forward to give the team a more orthodox look.",

        "\nThe center back's stoppage-time strike negated a free kick from Steven Gerrard during a tense Merseyside Derby. The hosts looked set to record a morale-boosting victory courtesy of a 65th-minute free kick from Steven Gerrard, who now boasts nine goals in Premier League Merseyside derbies, more than any other player. Everton handed a maiden Premier League start to Muhamed Besic, while Tony Hibbert featured from the start in a top-flight game for the first time in 666 days with Seamus Coleman (head) absent, and there were also recalls for Kevin Mirallas and Steven Naismith. Baines was judged to have fouled Balotelli 25 yards from goal and Gerrard stepped up to curl the resulting free kick over the wall and beyond Howard, who got his left hand to the ball but could not keep it out. This was a more humdrum version, which looked like being settled by Steven Gerrard\u2019s 10th derby goal until Phil Jagielka stole a point with a thunderous drive in stoppage time. Though Coutinho did improve Liverpool\u2019s passing options, the goal that broke the deadlock shortly after his arrival was an old Anfield standby, a shot from Steve Gerrard straight from a free-kick.

        "Mario Balotelli made a promising debut as Brendan Rodgers celebrated his 100th game in charge of Liverpool with a 3-0 win at Tottenham. Rodgers insisted in the buildup to Sunday's fixture that his club would not become \"the Balotelli show\" but the controversial striker went straight into the starting lineup at the expense of Philippe Coutinho. An early header almost gave Balotelli a dream start and he linked up well with fellow forwards Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge for the hour he was on to help Liverpool bounce back from Monday's 3-1 defeat at Manchester City and follow up last season's 5-0 and 4-0 victories over Tottenham with another emphatic Premier League romp. As well as bringing in Balotelli, Liverpool also made two changes in defense, with Mamadou Sakho and Javier Manquillo replacing Glen Johnson and Martin Skrtel, but Adam Lallana did not make the squad despite traveling to London after recovering from injury. Balotelli almost made a sensational start when heading on target from a Sturridge cross after just two minutes, but Hugo Lloris did well to save. Eric Dier had the home fans on their feet when a crunching tackle sent Balotelli sprawling, while the striker attracted more jeers when hooking wildly wide of an open goal after a poor clearance by Lloris, who had raced out of his area. Balotelli left the field soon after, to rapturous applause from the away fans, and Liverpool could have gone further ahead when Sterling waltzed through some woeful defending before hitting his shot tamely at Lloris. Mario Balotelli, who had drawn the pre-match focus, was hardly required to revel on debut. Balotelli\u2019s radar was uncharacteristically awry in front of goal but his composure in the six-yard box will return. Yet having been spared a second concession by Balotelli\u2019s profligacy \u2013 a pair of headers from close range and a miscued volley from distance with Hugo Lloris out of his area which dribbled wide \u2013 they should have equalised when Kaboul\u2019s diagonal pass confused Mamadou Sakho and Dejan Lovren to leave Chadli in possession in front of goal.",

Isla had penalty claims rejected when he went down under a challenge from Lloris, who saved once more from Austin in first-half stoppage time after Green kept out Walker's deflected drive. Midway through the second half, Tottenham's pressure eventually told as Kane sprung a sorry excuse for a QPR offside trap and coolly rounded Green to slot home. Both featured prominently, although the outcome also owed much to the contrast between the goalkeepers\u2019 fortunes, as Hugo Lloris enjoyed the rub of the green that his Rangers counterpart lacked. In the sixth minute Kyle Walker presented Kane with an early opportunity to impress the watching England manager but instead Hodgson must have admired the reactions of Rob Green, who showed terrific reflexes to beat away the forward\u2019s close-range header. Green could be forgiven for wishing Hodgson had left at that point \u2013 because in the 34th minute the goalkeeper charged off his line in a misguided attempt to cut out a cross from Andros Townsend.

        "Brendan Rodgers' side was convincingly beaten by Real Madrid in the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday, with Mario Balotelli's performance and halftime shirt swap causing controversy. Dejan Lovren's header was then kept out by Ahmed Elmohamady on the line after nine minutes before Balotelli was denied by Jakupovic from a narrow angle, though Hull's third-choice goalkeeper, making a rare outing due to injuries to Allan McGregor and Steve Harper, was rarely tested. Liverpool dominated after the break and Balotelli looked set to register his first league goal for the club just after the hour but an acrobatic clearance from Brady kept the scores level and Sterling's firm effort on the rebound was gathered comfortably by Jakupovic. The frustration continued for Liverpool and Balotelli as a third penalty shout was waved away after a clumsy challenge from Alex Bruce before the Italian spurned the final chance of the game. Substitute Coutinho crossed after good work down the left and Balotelli could only hit his effort at the goalkeeper as Hull clung on for a point. \nLiverpool 0-0 Hull City | Premier League match report\n\n\nMario Balotelli went from whipping boy to Liverpool\u2019s most effective player in the space of four days. Philippe Coutinho was arguably more effective in the half-hour he was granted, and Balotelli is still looking for his first league goal for Liverpool in spite of a couple of presentable late chances. Balotelli brought a good save from Eldin Jakupovic after 12 minutes, sent Alberto Moreno galloping down the left wing with an elegant backheel a little later, and even passed to colleagues on occasions instead of shooting every time he received the ball. The first half was still a dreary non-event, proof not even Balotelli\u2019s presence can guarantee an eventful game. Dejan Lovren saw an early header from a corner saved, Balotelli tested Jakupovic\u2019s reactions again, and that was about it. Liverpool, with Raheem Sterling isolated on the right and Balotelli mostly a spectator in the middle, were increasingly relying on set pieces and corners. A Coutinho corner, headed on by Emre Can, almost brought a first league goal for Balotelli but the striker was unable to force the ball over the line from close range. Then Lambert sent Sterling away down the right for a cross Balotelli might have converted had he not taken his eye off the ball to foul a defender. For all their pressure in the second half Liverpool never managed a shot on target until stoppage time, when Sterling, Coutinho and Balotelli came up with three in quick succession, all stopped by Jakupovic. Things might have been different had Lovren come up with more than an air shot on the six-yard line after Balotelli had teed him up, or had Lambert shown a better first touch when neatly played clear by Coutinho, but as the Hull goalkeeper was only busy for the added four minutes it was hard to argue the visitors did not deserve their point. Balotelli was involved in a late penalty appeal against Alex Bruce, but even Rodgers accepted his player was falling over anyway, concealing his disappointment that a stronger finisher would have stayed on his feet and put away the chance.",

        "\nTwo goals from Saido Berahino and one from Chris Brunt saw West Brom defeat 10-man Chelsea in the Premier League. Saido Berahino's brace either side of a bizarre Cesc Fabregas red card helped to condemn champion Chelsea to only its third Premier League defeat of the season as West Brom claimed a 3-0 win at The Hawthorns on Monday. Back in the Albion side after starting on the bench at Newcastle last time out, Berahino netted his first goal in 10 games in all competitions with a fine early opener and followed that with a penalty just after halftime after being upended by John Terry. Berahino took just nine minutes to repay Pulis' decision to recall him by putting Albion ahead in some style. Joleon Lescott rolled a simple pass that Berahino turned and ran on to before escaping the attentions of Gary Cahill and rifling right-footed into Courtois' bottom left-hand corner from 25 yards out. The drama continued straight after the interval as Terry bundled Berahino over in the box to concede a penalty within 30 seconds of the restart. A full-stretch Courtois got a hand to Berahino's spot kick, but it nestled in the bottom corner to make it 20 goals for the season in all competitions for the England Under-21 international and 14 in the league. Two goals from the impressive Saido Berahino \u2013 his 19th and 20th of the season \u2013 and another from Chris Brunt secured a memorable victory for West Bromwich Albion and inflicted Chelsea\u2019s heaviest league defeat under Mourinho since 2006.

        "The only downside for the home faithful was an injury to first-choice goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who was forced off after suffering a nasty blow to the head in an early collision with Alexis Sanchez. Calum Chambers could also have been dismissed after hauling down Andre Schurrle when already on a booking, while Gary Cahill's forceful tackle on Alexis could have been more severely punished by referee Martin Atkinson, who brandished only a caution. After a 15-minute delay to kick-off, reportedly due to a number of flares being let off outside the ground, there was a moment of concern for Chelsea in the 10th minute as Courtois collided with Alexis. With little happening on the field, the opening stages were also notable for an argument on the touchline as Cahill's heavy challenge on Alexis provoked an irate response from Wenger, who pushed Mourinho in the chest. Yet this was not a good day for keeping by the rules and Chelsea will face some awkward questions about the head injury suffered by the goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois, and why they let him carry on after he had been left flat out on his back, eyes closed, after his collision with Alexis Sanchez. They also have a good case for thinking that Gary Cahill should have been sent off for the scything challenge on Sanchez that persuaded Wenger to stride from his technical area to the one designated for Chelsea personnel and respond to Mourinho\u2019s orders for a retreat by putting both hands into his chest to give him a shove and then reminding him, close-up, who was the taller, more imposing man.",

        "Saido Berahino's brace either side of a bizarre Cesc Fabregas red card helped to condemn champion Chelsea to only its third Premier League defeat of the season as West Brom claimed a 3-0 win at The Hawthorns on Monday. Fabregas was given his marching orders in between the striker's double for petulantly kicking the ball at Chris Brunt during a stoppage in play after the fit-again Diego Costa and Gareth McAuley grappled in the box. In a lively start, Thibaut Courtois got down well to turn Callum McManaman's angled drive behind and Fabregas evaded two tackles as he slalomed into the penalty area at the opposite end before firing straight at Boaz Myhill. Just 29 minutes in, Fabregas was dismissed in unusual circumstances. Fabregas, all on his own on the opposite side of the penalty area, inexplicably struck the dead ball back into the crowd of players and into the back of Brunt's head, prompting Jones to brandish a straight red. Yet it was the bizarre red card that Cesc Fabregas received in the 30th minute that riled the Portuguese more than anything. Mike Jones, the referee, was dealing with a melee on the other side of the penalty area after Diego Costa had been booked following an off-the-ball altercation with Gareth McAuley, when Fabregas, stood about 20 yards away, kicked the ball in the direction of a crowd of Albion players and caught Brunt on the side of the head. The offence will go down as violent conduct and means that Fabregas, in what was essentially a meaningless game, has picked up a three-match suspension that rules him out of the final fixture of this term, at home against Sunderland, and, much more significantly, the first two matches of next season. The debate about whether the decision was harsh was guaranteed to go on long into the night but whatever the rights and wrongs of the sending off, there is no escaping the fact that it was a stupid thing for Fabregas to do, especially when the referee was stood so close to Brunt.

Lallana sent a rasping 43rd-minute drive narrowly wide and Liverpool belatedly rallied in the closing moments of the first half - Balotelli's speculative strike looping over off Alan Hutton before Baker produced a vital stoppage time block as Alberto Moreno stormed into the box.

Fabio Borini and Rickie Lambert replaced Balotelli and Markovic with 20 minutes remaining and Liverpool came close to an equalizer when Coutinho's effort at the end of a jinking run came back off the upright. Mario Balotelli was struggling to get into the game, though the Italian was hardly helped by the myopic officiating that allowed Senderos to get away with a clear trip after the ball had gone. Balotelli also had reason to feel aggrieved about subsequent challenges by Senderos and Alan Hutton but limited his reaction to picking himself up slowly and looking balefully at the referee.

Rodgers freshened his attack with Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini for the last 20 minutes, the former replacing the labouring Balotelli and the latter gaining an unexpected chance at the expense of Lazar Markovic, who had actually looked one of Liverpool\u2019s more promising players going forward.",

Djuricic was immediately into the action, going down under pressure from Emre Can in the penalty area after 20 seconds, but referee Kevin Friend was unmoved. There was more frustration for Southampton as another challenge on Djuricic inside the box, this time from Joe Allen, went unpunished and Simon Mignolet made a fine save when the loose ball broke to Eljero Elia. The Belgium goalkeeper then beat away a Djuricic strike to ensure Liverpool's advantage remained intact at the break. Their closest shave was when Joe Allen swung a leg and up-ended Filip Djuricic in the penalty box, the ball breaking to Eljero Elia who should have scored only for Simon Mignolet to save with his feet. Djuricic felt he might have earned a penalty in the opening 20 seconds, sensing Emre Can\u2019s hand on his shoulder if then tumbling too theatrically. \u201cBut the second one, definitely.\u201d\n \n\u201cMaybe Djuricic, in that first moment, fell down a bit too easily in the box,\u201d said Ronald Koeman.",

Nevertheless, the visiting side made a confident start as Nugent, Jeffrey Schlupp and Riyad Mahrez all asked questions of the Chelsea defense. Courtois then found himself back in action to keep out Nugent's deflected attempt on the counter-attack, although the sight of Schurrle curling a shot over the crossbar underlined Chelsea's continued threat. Again, though, Courtois was forced to outdo his opposite number, saving superbly after Nugent had raced clear one-on-one only to produce a shot that lacked conviction. David Nugent might like to look away here. With 53 minutes gone (and moments after Oscar had hit the post at the other end), a pass from Hammond put Nugent in on goal, only for Courtois to make a fine low save with his legs. Moments later, it was Nugent v Courtois II, a better chance drawing a better save as Mahrez bypassed the entire Chelsea midfield with a single pass on the break, Nugent hared in on goal and Chelsea\u2019s goalkeeper sprinted out to hurl himself at his feet and deflect a hesitant shot wide.",

        "\nWith all eyes on Raheem Sterling, Arsenal sent a message of intent with a 4-1 Premier League win over Liverpool on Saturday. Arsenal's stunning eight-minute first-half spell stole the spotlight from Raheem Sterling as the hosts moved into second place with a 4-1 Premier League win over Liverpool. Sterling won a penalty late in the second half, converted by Jordan Henderson, but there was no way back as Liverpool's UEFA Champions League hopes were left hanging by a thread \u2014 the visitors' disappointing afternoon compounded when Emre Can was dismissed and Olivier Giroud added a fourth in stoppage time. And yet the script could have read so differently if Lazar Markovic had found his passing touch in the 20th minute, when he failed to supply the ammunition for Sterling \u2014 starting up front in place of Daniel Sturridge \u2014 to net what would have been a simple finish. Sterling dominated the headlines in the buildup to the match, having publicly discussed his contract situation at Liverpool and declared himself \"flattered\" by links to Arsenal. Liverpool's moment came and went when Markovic drew the attention of David Ospina, only to fluff his lines in playing a simple square pass for Sterling \u2014 the ball narrowly eluding the forward with only the unguarded net in front of him. It heralded a promising spell of play for Rodgers' men, in which Sterling fired wide and Henderson was agonizingly close to collecting a cross from the 20-year-old inside the box. Ospina denied Can at the other end before Sterling was hacked down in the box by Bellerin, who was fortunate not to be shown a second yellow. Raheem Sterling began up front, the centre of attention. Philippe Coutinho\u2019s delicate pass to Lazar Markovic was perfect; Markovic\u2019s layoff to the onrushing Sterling fractionally less so. Sterling flashed a leg at the ball but it was gone. They did get one goal back via the penalty spot, when Bellerin tripped Sterling.",

In what was a full-blooded match, Laurent Koscielny was perhaps fortunate not to be shown a red card for denying a clear goal-scoring opportunity in bringing down Hazard for Chelsea's spot kick, but Costa's sublime finish after a lofted pass from former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas with 12 minutes left but the result beyond doubt. Hazard ought to have netted his and Chelsea's second when he fired off target from close range 14 minutes from time, but soon afterwards Costa made the game safe. Chelsea have won seven matches during that sequence and once we had waded through all the varying subplots and controversies the bottom line is the Premier League leaders have re-established a five-point advantage ahead of Manchester City \u2013 and gone nine clear of Arsenal \u2013 courtesy of Eden Hazard\u2019s expertly taken penalty and the latest demonstration of Diego Costa\u2019s penalty-box prowess.

        "A late strike from Willian ensured Chelsea beat Everton 1-0 at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday to remain seven points clear at the top of the Premier League. Tim Howard looked set to deny the leaders victory on his return from injury, but the Everton goalkeeper was unable to keep out a deflected strike from Brazil midfielder Willian just a minute from time in a dramatic finale. Eden Hazard, Willian and Nemanja Matic were all thwarted by the former Manchester United man and Branislav Ivanovic had a late goal disallowed for offside, before Willian secured an 11th win from 12 top-flight home games. Romelu Lukaku was denied by a fine save from the recalled Petr Cech and also went close in the first half for the visitor, which had Gareth Barry sent off for a second bookable offense just before Willian struck. Fellow midfielder Willian went even closer with a dipping shot from just outside the penalty area, before Lukaku almost struck at the other end against his former club when he raced into the box. The busy Howard again demonstrated why Martinez was so eager to recall him when he produced a diving stop to keep out a measured Willian effort, before Cech showed his class at the other end to thwart an unmarked Lukaku. Barry was then dismissed for a challenge on Willian which sparked a mass confrontation, and there was more drama to come, as Howard fisted away a cross into Willian's path and he rifled home with the aid of a defletion to stun Everton.",

It was nearly made even better for Pochettino's men before the final whistle, as Pantilimon's decision to go up for a corner allowed Vertonghen to break and finish into an empty net, only to be contentiously ruled out for offside when he appeared to have taken the ball from his own half. Eriksen shot weakly at Costel Pantilimon after a cross by Danny Rose and then, in the 24th minute, the goalkeeper raced off his line to deny Roberto Soldado after Vergini\u2019s dawdling kept the striker onside.

        "\nJuan Mata's double in a 2-1 win was overshadowed as Steven Gerrard saw red in his final game for Liverpool against Manchester United. Steven Gerrard was sensationally sent off just 38 seconds into what will likely be his final Liverpool appearance against Manchester United, as Louis van Gaal's men took a huge step toward UEFA Champions League qualification with a 2-1 win at Anfield. Long regarded as the biggest game in English football, Sunday's encounter lived up to the billing with goals and excitement at both ends, yet it will be remembered for Gerrard's unceremonious exit. Having contested a full-blooded 50-50 challenge with Ander Herrera, Gerrard saw red for stamping on the leg of the Spaniard, meaning he will now serve a three-match ban that will leave him with just five more Premier League games in a Liverpool shirt ahead of his move from his boyhood club to the LA Galaxy. The visitors' task was made easier in the second half thanks to Gerrard's moment of madness, with Mata subsequently doubling United's advantage with a goal that on another day would likely have stolen the headlines. With Gerrard reduced to the role of spectator, Liverpool struggled in midfield, as Joe Allen and Jordan Henderson found it difficult to retain possession. Gerrard was thrown into the fray in place of Lallana at the  break, but he was soon making his way off the field in ignominy following a rush of blood. \nLiverpool 1-2 Manchester United | Premier League match report\n\n\nIt was a performance from Manchester United that has been a long time in the making and for Steven Gerrard another personal ordeal in an expanding file. Gerrard badly let down his team-mates and for a player of his distinction that will be the hardest thing to take. Gerrard had barely worked up a bead of sweat by the time he was on his way back down the tunnel. Gerrard dealt out his own retribution, bringing down his studs on Herrera\u2019s shin while the Spaniard was on the ground. But Gerrard? \u201cHe [Gerrard] was probably frustrated; we didn\u2019t make a tackle.\u201d In better times Gerrard would have found another way. It was, however, easy to understand if Gerrard was burning with frustration. Henderson was overwhelmed in a way that, ironically, must have made the home crowd crave Gerrard\u2019s presence. Liverpool, as Rodgers said, needed Gerrard. The old Gerrard, that is, not the one who lasted 38 seconds.",

Eriksen should perhaps have hit the target from inside the area eight minutes in before Aguero made Lamela pay for his carelessness by shifting the ball quickly onto his right foot and curling an effort past Lloris. Lloris kept his penalty out following Younes Kaboul's clumsy tackle on David Silva, and the Argentinian acrobatically fired the rebound over. Tottenham certainly carried a threat going forward but defensively they were poor in the extreme and fortunate, perhaps, that Hugo Lloris stopped the score being even more harrowing.

        "\nDiego Costa and Eden Hazard scored early as the Blues remained undefeated in the Premier League. Diego Costa was on target yet again as Chelsea beat 10-man West Brom 2-0 to go seven points clear at the top of the Premier League. Costa and Cesc Fabregas were named in the starting lineup after missing Spain's clashes with Belarus and Germany with hamstring problems and played key roles as Chelsea's ominous start to the season continued. Striker Costa scored his 11th goal in 10 top-flight games and Eden Hazard was also on target in the first half Saturday as Mourinho's side made it six Premier League wins out of six at Stamford Bridge. West Brom had struggled to live with the London club even before Claudio Yacob was shown a straight red card for a challenge on Costa, when he won the ball but appeared to go in with two feet. Foster was unable to prevent the hosts taking the lead six minutes later, though, as Oscar picked out the unmarked Costa with a fine cross from the left and the striker showed great composure to control the ball on his chest and volley beyond the England goalkeeper. West Brom appealed for offside, but Andre Wisdom appeared to keep Costa onside. Chelsea was brimming with confidence and Foster made a stunning double save to keep out Oscar's long-range drive and the lively Costa following up. Things went from bad to worse for the visitors four minutes later, as Yacob was shown a straight red card for a challenge on Costa when he got the ball first, but referee Lee Mason deemed the tackle to be dangerous. The marauding Branislav Ivanovic was unable to square the ball into Costa's path with the goal gaping after racing onto a precise Fabregas pass, then Foster did well to thwart Costa, Oscar and Hazard as Chelsea breached the Albion defence all too easily. But he was helpless in the 11th minute when Oscar clipped a cross over to Diego Costa, who, as the defenders appealed justifiably for offside, killed the ball on his chest before finishing in typically deadly fashion from 12 yards. Foster had to scramble to his feet to prevent Costa from scoring on the rebound, no defender having anticipated the problem. He was making his first Premier League start for 658 days following injury and loss of form and his rustiness was exposed by Branislav Ivanovic in the 19th minute when the Serb raced past him and crossed for Costa, who shot inches wide. Especially when Yacob was sent off for what can only be described as a pogo-tackle \u2013 the midfielder jumped with two feet into a challenge with Costa and although he landed on the ball, the referee, Lee Mason, deemed it dangerous, a decision that Irvine agreed was \u201cunderstandable\u201d.

Despite lacking match sharpness, Sturridge was dangerous throughout his 74 minutes on the pitch and was heavily involved in Liverpool's first two goals. Steven Gerrard restored Liverpool's advantage from the penalty spot eight minutes after halftime after Sturridge had gone down under an ill-advised challenge from Danny Rose. Liverpool's early pressure paid off as Markovic made the most of good hold-up play from Sturridge to find the bottom-right corner with a scuffed strike from the edge of the area despite Hugo Lloris getting a hand to the shot. Tottenham struggled to build on that equalizer, and only the woodwork kept Spurs on level terms as Sturridge struck the post with a clever back-heeled effort following brilliant work down the right from Ibe. The skipper beat Lloris to the keeper's left-hand side after Sturridge had cleverly jinked his way into the box and drawn a foul on Rose. But Daniel Sturridge returned for his first league start since Liverpool\u2019s 3-0 win at White Hart Lane in August and would influence another defeat for Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s team, their fifth in succession in this fixture. Inevitable rustiness from Sturridge reprieved the visitors on those occasions. Lazar Markovic volleyed over from close range and Lloris made an excellent save to deny Sturridge after Jordan Ibe combined with the Serb down the right. Vertonghen\u2019s unconvincing challenge on Sturridge rebounded kindly into the path of Markovic, Eric Dier dropped off for reasons best known to himself and the \u00a320m summer signing from Benfica scuffed his shot beyond Lloris\u2019s weak left hand and into the bottom corner.

        "Ayoze Perez scored the winner for Newcastle United for the second Premier League match running as Liverpool was beaten 1-0 on Saturday. The Premier League's highest scoring fixture \u2014 having yielded 129 goals before this meeting \u2014 looked set to be heading for a scoreless draw until Perez's 73rd-minute strike, which condemned the visitors to their fourth top-flight defeat of the season. The Senegal striker did not return for the second half as Perez was brought on to add fresh impetus to Newcastle's attack, with that change ultimately proving crucial. Former Sunderland man Fabio Borini threatened with a powerful low strike from the edge of the area two minutes after coming off the bench, but it was Perez who made the breakthrough. Sissoko's cross was not dealt with by Alberto Moreno, and Perez was on hand to fire the ball home. A rapid breakaway almost led to a second when Remy Cabella and Perez linked well, but the Frenchman's effort was kept out by the right foot of Simon Mignolet.",

Liverpool responded well to that setback as former Chelsea defender Glen Johnson fired into the side-netting from a tight angle before Coutinho was denied by Thibaut Courtois.

Ex-Liverpool defender Martin Kelly featured as one of five changes to an experimental Palace lineup and he had an unwitting hand in his former team\u2019s opener \u2014 playing a dreadful pass back toward fellow center back Scott Dann for Lallana to intercept, charge through on goal and finish emphatically. Martin Kelly played Scott Dann into trouble with a careless pass behind his central defensive colleague and Adam Lallana took full advantage, pressuring Dann into a slip, racing through from deep and sweeping an excellent finish into the top corner of Wayne Hennessey\u2019s goal, then seeking out Gerrard for the celebration of only his fifth goal of an injury-hit season. The men in yellow showed more urgency in the second half too and were incensed when the FA Cup final referee, Jon Moss, ignored two strong penalty appeals when Martin Skrtel handled Bolasie\u2019s cross and then clipped Lee on the follow-up.",

        "And Harry Kane's deflected free kick in the 90th minute rubbed salt into the Villa wounds as Tottenham secured only its second win in eight top-flight games. It was Kane's ninth goal in 13 appearances across all competitions this season and will lead to more calls for the England Under-21 striker to be given his first Premier League start under Pochettino. Kane also came on for Adebayor 12 minutes after the interval and made an immediate impact by forcing a save out of Guzan from a tight angle, then heading straight at the United States keeper from the resulting corner. And Kane sealed a dramatic late comeback when his free kick deflected off Baker and gave the wrong-footed Guzan no chance. Harry Kane, who has yet to start a Premier League game this season despite scoring eight times in cup football, came off the substitutes\u2019 bench to hit the winner and further endear himself to the travelling supporters who had been singing his name as early as the first half. Erik Lamela must have fancied his chances when Spurs were awarded a free-kick 25 yards from goal in the 90th minute but Kane took charge of the situation and his right-footed shot deflected off Nathan Baker to leave Brad Guzan stranded. Vulnerable at the back, where Benteke caused Younes Kaboul no end of problems in the first half, devoid of ideas in midfield \u2013 Pochettino withdrew Christian Eriksen at half-time \u2013 and toothless up front before Kane\u2019s introduction, Spurs have plenty of work to do on this evidence. Pochettino threw his water bottle down in disgust and Spurs fans made their own feelings known by calling for Kane. It was left to Kane to twist the knife with his deflected free-kick.\n\n\n",

Henderson tried to pass in a curling finish in the 24th minute, but again Heaton was equal to the task, before the shot-stopper rushed off his line to deny Sturridge following Michael Keane's poor defensive header. It seemed a matter of time before Liverpool took the lead and Heaton was finally beaten when Henderson lashed a ferocious 20-yard strike beyond him. The skipper pounced after Philippe Coutinho's effort was blocked, with Henderson\u2019s strike swerving late, much to the delight of the Anfield crowd. Sturridge finally got his goal in the second half, pouncing on some slack marking to head past Heaton at the near post following Henderson's cross. Burnley felt it had claims for a penalty when Danny Ings, a reported transfer target for Liverpool, went down under pressure from Henderson, while Barnes fired an effort wide on the hour mark. \nLiverpool 2-0 Burnley | Premier League match report\n\n\nBrendan Rodgers denies it is a foregone conclusion that Jordan Henderson will be promoted from vice- to club captain when Steven Gerrard heads for Los Angeles this summer. Henderson followed his sublime opener against Manchester City on Sunday with another fine 20-yard goal to puncture a determined display by Burnley at Anfield. Scored one, made one; and Liverpool required a captain\u2019s performance from Henderson, with Sean Dyche\u2019s men proving predictably obstinate opponents. \u201cJordan is improving all the time,\u201d said Rodgers, who argued Liverpool\u2019s display was on a par with the win against City in terms of defensive organisation and professionalism. He is becoming one of the real leaders of this team.\u201d\n \nWhether that is enough to succeed Gerrard as captain remains to be seen and the impasse over a new contract for Henderson, who enters the final 12 months of his current deal this summer, does not help his cause. Dyche\u2019s side made life difficult until Henderson\u2019s opener in the 29th minute by employing the same high-pressing tactics that Rodgers used to telling effect against the Premier League champions. Henderson headed over from a Coutinho corner and forced Heaton into another decent save low to his left from the edge of the area. The rebound bounced towards Henderson on the edge of the area and, having adjusted his body shape to get behind the ball, the midfielder sent an unstoppable half-volley swerving away from Heaton\u2019s grasp and into the Kop goal. This time Henderson turned creator, finding space in central midfield to float an inch-perfect cross over the visitors\u2019 defence.",

Brendan Rodgers' men could have trailed but Steven Davis missed a golden opportunity and was made to pay as Sturridge reacted quickest to Sterling's header to prod home. Sturridge first fired into the stands before Sterling shot straight at Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster, but a genuine piece of quality from Henderson helped them break the deadlock. From inside his own half, the midfielder hit an inch-perfect pass with his left foot that split defenders Jose Fonte and Clyne to set Sterling free. The England midfielder powered through a 50-50 with Schneiderlin and sent Raheem Sterling scurrying clear of Nathaniel Clyne with an exquisite left-footed pass.

Eriksen picked up the ball on the edge of the area and placed an accurate finish into the bottom left-hand corner to spark scenes of jubilation among the travelling fans in south Wales. Spurs had taken an early lead through Harry Kane's 12th goal of the season - a powerful header from Eriksen's delivery. But it was Eriksen and Tottenham who had the final say in the last minute, as the visitor leapfrogged its opponents and went seventh, while Swansea fell to just a second home defeat of the campaign. Tremmel's first meaningful action was to pick the ball out of his net in the fourth minute after Kane had got up above Angel Rangel to head in Eriksen's right-wing corner.

However, while Jose Mourinho's men were far from their fluent best, they always looked the more likely to grab a winner after the break, with Costa striking a post before Fraser Forster denied Willian, Eden Hazard and substitute Loic Remy. Willian was one of two Chelsea changes and the Brazilian posed early problems for Southampton down the right, but it was frontman Costa who opened the scoring 11 minutes in. Branislav Ivanovic delivered a deep cross from the right following Hazard's layoff, and an unmarked Costa had the simplest of tasks to head home and register his 19th goal of the season.

        "Daniel Sturridge was the hero as Liverpool overcame a spirited Southampton to begin its Premier League campaign with a hard-earned three points at Anfield. But Sturridge \u2014 now Liverpool's main man in attack \u2014 saved the day with a predatory finish from 4 yards with just 11 minutes to play. Brendan Rodgers' men could have trailed but Steven Davis missed a golden opportunity and was made to pay as Sturridge reacted quickest to Sterling's header to prod home. Sturridge first fired into the stands before Sterling shot straight at Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster, but a genuine piece of quality from Henderson helped them break the deadlock. Rickie Lambert came off the bench to feature against his old club, but it was his strike partner, Sturridge, who stole in front of Clyne to score the winner, while Mignolet's heroics at the other end were just as crucial. Twelve months ago Liverpool laboured to three points against a team under new management courtesy of a Daniel Sturridge goal and an 89th-minute penalty save from Simon Mignolet. A poacher\u2019s goal from Sturridge plus a superb 88th-minute save from Mignolet, who tipped Morgan Schneiderlin\u2019s goal-bound volley on to the bar to preserve a slender lead, left Southampton lamenting an undeserved defeat. But Koeman summed up the contest perfectly when he said: \u201cWe created two great possibilities to score a second goal but the quality of Liverpool is that they don\u2019t need a lot of opportunities to score two goals.\u201d\n \nOn the first day of life without Luis Suarez, who sent Rodgers a good luck text before kick-off, it reassured Liverpool to witness another predatory finish from Sturridge. Sturridge has scored 36 goals in 50 appearances for his club, the most prolific return of any Liverpool player since George Allan in the late 19th century, and his 79th-minute winner signalled mass relief around Anfield. Sterling, Sturridge and Philippe Coutinho began to move with greater menace but Southampton\u2019s shape and composure held firm.

        "Premier League holders Manchester City continued a fine start to its title defense, with two goals from Stevan Jovetic setting it on its way to a 3-1 win over last year's runners-up, Liverpool. Jovetic then combined with Samir Nasri on 55 minutes to give Manuel Pellegrini's side breathing room before Sergio Aguero struck immediately after coming on as a substitute. Hart's efforts proved crucial for City as it went on to open the scoring through Jovetic with four minutes of the half remaining. To rub salt into the Liverpool wounds, City promptly doubled its lead as Jovetic completed a neat one-two with Nasri with a calm finish. Stevan Jovetic had already provided a couple of his own reminders with the opening goals on the night City joined Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Swansea City in starting the season with back-to-back wins. They had been the better side until Jovetic\u2019s first goal, five minutes before the break, but they never played with the menace that was associated with Liverpool last season and did not threaten Joe Hart\u2019s goal with any sustained momentum until a header from their substitute, Rickie Lambert, came back off the goalkeeper and went in off Pablo Zabaleta seven minutes from the end. Stevan Jovetic opens the scoring. Jovetic\u2019s first goal was a particular ordeal for Liverpool\u2019s new left-back, Alberto Moreno, and Dejan Lovren, another of their summer signings, will not enjoy the replays of Aguero\u2019s goal. Jovetic\u2019s first season in Manchester was almost written off by injuries but his talent has never been in question and it was an emphatic right-foot shot he struck beneath Mignolet for the first goal. It was a lazy swing of his left boot that allowed the alert Jovetic to pinch the ball. Clichy, in particular, had to worry about the pace and directness of Raheem Sterling but one of City\u2019s great strengths is the way they gang up on the opposition full-backs in wide positions and it was noticeable that when Zabaleta did start venturing forward more regularly it helped Jovetic to his second goal, turning in Samir Nasri\u2019s pass from the right.",

Sterling's crucial strike came shortly after the hour mark as he coolly rounded Tom Heaton and slotted home, despite the best efforts of two defenders attempting to scramble back. Burnley failed to re-create its high-tempo play after the restart, and fell behind to Sterling's well-taken goal. \nBurnley 0-1 Liverpool | Premier League match report\n\n\nLiverpool\u2019s plan to climb out of mid-table mediocrity and into the top four is up and running thanks to a decisive finish by Raheem Sterling that enlivened a forgettable game. In the first half especially Liverpool were a long way from irresistible but they kept possession better the longer the game went on and in Sterling they possessed the sort of matchwinner Burnley would dearly love to have, someone capable of seizing on the most fleeting of opportunities and taking full advantage. Sterling is still learning as a centre-forward, it is not his normal position, and he finished his one opportunity with much more aplomb than he showed in similar situations when one on one with David de Gea in the recent defeat at Old Trafford. \u201cPlaying in that position Raheem will get those chances because of his pace,\u201d Brendan Rodgers said. While Liverpool had begun brightly enough, with Sterling finding plenty of space and Philippe Coutinho picking him up with pinpoint deliveries, by midway through the first half too many passes were going astray, Lazar Markovic was unable to bring his pace to bear on the left, and Sterling and Coutinho became isolated. Neither side was creating much and Burnley were perhaps just starting to think a point might not be the worst of outcomes when Coutinho and Sterling combined in an instant to create a goal out of nothing. All it took was a lofted prod forward by the former for the latter to run on to, and Sterling\u2019s pace did the rest.

Thibaut Courtois was not called into serious action until five minutes into the second half, when he reacted smartly to tip Barnes' deflected shot over the crossbar. Tempers threatened to boil over in the 70th minute, when Barnes went over the top of the ball in a challenge on Matic, who angrily pushed the striker to the floor and was shown a straight red card, while the Burnley man went unpunished. Barnes, perhaps fortunate to remain on the field, thought he had found an equalizer 10 minutes later but Courtois produced a superb one-handed save low to his right.

        "But it was Lescott's defensive colleague Craig Dawson who almost made the first telling contribution to the match, nodding narrowly over after finding himself stationed high up the pitch following a corner. Lescott was unfortunate to miss out on a debut goal when Dawson accidentally blocked his shot from close range, while Craig Gardner brought an excellent save from Hugo Lloris with a shot from distance. And West Brom then had a legitimate claim for a penalty turned down when Dawson's header appeared to strike Emmanuel Adebayor's hand. And that was typified by a marvellous headed clearance on the goalline from Dawson at the death that saw West Brom keep hold of all three points. Irvine could revel in a clutch of excellent performances, chiefly from Morrison, the striker Saido Berahino and the centre-halves Craig Dawson and Joleon Lescott. Dawson looped an early header wide and he accidentally got in the way of a Lescott shot following a corner. Craig Gardner drew a smart save from Lloris after Morrison\u2019s square ball and Berahino\u2019s hard running worried the home defence. Dawson\u2019s flicked header from Morrison\u2019s corner on the half-hour sent the ball into Emmanuel Adebayor\u2019s outstretched hand and, if the Tottenham striker had little time to react, the hand was certainly a long way from being pinned to his side.",

Liverpool created the first chance of the second period, Martin Skrtel volleying just wide after Palace failed to clear Steven Gerrard's corner.

The hosts were the better side in the first half, but Chelsea responded like a champion does, with Didier Drogba leveling proceedings in the 48th minute. Chelsea came out firing after the break, though, and was quickly on level terms through Drogba, after a dink from Eden Hazard - the newly crowned PFA Player of the Year - set Branislav Ivanovic free. And the defender stormed towards the byline before steering a pass to Drogba, who made no mistake from nine yards with a typically predatory finish. The chances kept coming for Chelsea, as Drogba flashed an effort just wide from a difficult angle, while Willian curled over as the visitors pressed for a second goal. Didier Drogba showed glimpses of his old self and it was typical of John Terry that it was his goal, coming forward from defence, that put Chelsea into the lead 11 minutes from time. Drogba\u2019s equaliser came three minutes after the restart and, from that point onwards Leicester barely threatened again.

Willian raced away down the inside right and, after his shot was palmed straight back to him by Brad Guzan, the former Anzhi man cut the ball back to the onrushing Oscar to side-foot home despite the best efforts of Alan Hutton.

City spurned the chance to extend their advantage when Aguero saw a penalty saved by Hugo Lloris shortly after the half-hour mark, volleying the rebound over the bar, and Soldado followed suit in the second half as Joe Hart kept his penalty out. However, the visitors' response was almost immediate \u2014 Ryan Mason taking the ball off Fernando before Soldado's pass allowed Eriksen a clear sight of goal, his shot coming off Hart's knee and nestling into the net via the crossbar\n\nLamela's difficult half continued when he was harshly judged to have fouled Lampard inside the area, allowing Aguero to continue his fine form and surpass Carlos Tevez in terms of Premier League goals for the English champions. Spurs were awarded the game's third penalty when Martin Demichelis was ruled to have fouled Eriksen \u2014 but Soldado, making his first league start since March, fluffed his lines with a weak effort easily saved by Hart. It started early on when he jutted out a leg to prevent Ryan Mason opening the scoring and his portfolio of saves included one from the penalty spot when Roberto Soldado had the chance to make it 2-2 just after the hour. Instead, Hart dived full-length to his right to keep out Soldado\u2019s penalty and within five minutes Fazio was trudging off the pitch and Aguero was about to make it 3-1 with his third spot-kick. Replays showed Soldado had been marginally outside the area when Martin Demichelis tripped him but, equally, the visitors were aggrieved with the first of City\u2019s penalties, when Frank Lampard went down under the slightest of touches from the accident-prone Erik Lamela.",

An unmarked Senderos should have doubled Villa's lead in the 13th minute after Lallana earned a booking for a rash challenge on Cleverley.

Sterling replaced Lallana with an hour played and Hutton was rightly booked for greeting the England forward with a robust challenge that prompted a scuffle involving players from both teams. Villa could only be encouraged and, with Adam Lallana marking his debut with a booking for a rash challenge on Tom Cleverley and Javier Manquillo having to make a smart recovery after being surprised by Agbonlahor\u2019s pace, there was no doubt which side had bossed the first quarter.

        "He gave the hosts a 41st-minute lead, before a rare mistake from Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois allowed David Silva to equalize in the final minute of the first half. The visitors started sharply, as Courtois beat away a stinging shot from Jesus Navas inside the first 20 seconds and Fernandinho had a low, angled drive deflected wide. James Milner was alert to disposes Chelsea right back Branislav Ivanovic in the 24th minute and play the ball into Sergio Aguero, but Kurt Zouma forced City's top scorer to shoot from an acute angle and Courtois saved comfortably. Courtois' opposite number, Joe Hart, made his first save of the match from an Oscar effort after an error by Vincent Kompany let Remy escape down the left flank. City's response was immediate, as Courtois fumbled a searching Navas cross, Aguero smashed the loose ball back towards goal and Silva prodded home. Silva and Navas combined on the right flank for Fernandinho to plant a header into the turf - Courtois turning the bouncing ball over. Silva\u2019s goal was a calamity for Thibaut Courtois but it was not the only occasion when normally dependable players made individual mistakes in and around their penalty area and it was strange to see such an accomplished group of footballers being so generous. Jesus Navas had their first effort saved by Courtois after only 17 seconds and Pellegrini was entitled to be disappointed his side could not be more ruthless bearing in mind they had a number of chances at 0-0 and the best of the play in the second half without being able to put together a really inviting opportunity. On this occasion it lasted only four minutes and featured the first major mistake from Courtois since his return to his parent club from Atletico Madrid.",

The recalled Sturridge tested Tom Heaton in the Burnley goal after 25 seconds and while that marked the start of a high-tempo contest it was not the signal for Liverpool to dominate against relegation-threatened visitors. Henderson headed over from a Coutinho corner and forced Heaton into another decent save low to his left from the edge of the area.

        "\nLoic Remy was on target again as Chelsea beat Stoke City to move closer to the Premier League title, despite Charlie Adam's stunning goal. Loic Remy had replaced Costa in the starting lineup and, just as he did at Hull City last time out, the France striker scored the winner following a mistake from the otherwise outstanding Asmir Begovic as Chelsea continued its march toward regaining the title. Remy wasted no time in making his presence felt, as he almost put Chelsea in front with a deflected strike that was destined for the top corner until Begovic somehow scrambled across to make an impressive reflex save just two minutes in. The Bosnia-Herzegovina international rolled the ball out carelessly in the 62nd minutes and Willian pounced to play in Hazard, who surged into the penalty area before unselfishly laying the ball off to Remy. Chelsea's joy was almost shortlived, as Steven N'Zonzi clipped the outside of the post soon after Remy had struck, while Begovic made a fine double save to deny Juan Cuadrado at the other end as the leaders secured another three points. His absence will be felt, particularly given there are collisions with Manchester United and Arsenal to come after next Sunday\u2019s west London derby at Loftus Road, even if his stand-in, Loic Remy, has now scored the winner in successive games.",

The London club suffered a costly 1-0 defeat at Aston Villa when the two sides last met back in March, which dealt a major blow to Chelsea's title hopes, but it gained revenge as Paul Lambert's men failed to recover from Oscar's early strike. Ramires was ruled out with a muscular injury, so Oscar was given the nod to replace him in the only change to the side that drew 1-1 at Manchester City on Sunday. Willian raced away down the inside right and, after his shot was palmed straight back to him by Brad Guzan, the former Anzhi man cut the ball back to the onrushing Oscar to side-foot home despite the best efforts of Alan Hutton. Oscar must have thought he had his second when he poked the ball beyond Guzan, but Cissokho raced back to clear just before it could cross the line. Brad Guzan pushed the ball straight back into his path, and this time Willian pulled back to the now-clear Oscar, whose finish trundled through Philippe Senderos\u2019s legs on its way to goal.

Twenty minutes later, Aly Cissokho having in the meantime cleared Oscar\u2019s casual effort as it rolled towards the line, Costa was found in too much space on the left, from where he cut inside, cut inside a little more and then sent in a shot that bounced off Guzan and Cissokho before landing helpfully between Willian and an empty net.\n\n\n",

Chelsea responded as Costa brought a save out of Heaton five minutes later, the Spain international going in search of his 18th league goal of the campaign. Diego Costa, as in Paris, was struggling to rediscover the form he showed before his three-game suspension but in the 32nd minute he did well to find Cuadrado, who set up Ivanovic for another shot, this time from 20 yards. Chelsea appealed in the 43rd minute when Costa collapsed in the box following contact from Jason Shackell.

The champions continued to press and a crisp passing move involving Yaya Toure, David Silva and Aguero saw Dzeko bring them level after 25 minutes. The striker collected a perfectly weighted reverse pass from strike partner Aguero before firing past Simon Mignolet from 12 yards. Both sides wasted chances early in the second half as Aguero and Sterling failed to convert from inside the penalty area, while Lallana had a second effort ruled out by the assistant referee.

Even an added urgency could not spark a turnaround for West Ham after the restart, Costa firing home his 13th goal in 15 Premier League outings since moving to Chelsea. The opening goal finally arrived in the 31st minute, as Terry tapped home after Costa had flicked on Fabregas' corner. Chelsea threatened three more times before the interval, Nemanja Matic seeing a 20-yard effort tipped around the post before Costa twice missed the target with good opportunities. Their introduction came in the wake of more uncharacteristic profligacy from Chelsea, Costa poking straight at Adrian from Fabregas' free-kick. Costa and Fabregas spurned further chances to add gloss to the scoreline, before Amalfitano fluffed the chance of setting up an exciting finish when his chip over Thibaut Courtois hit the woodwork. John Terry and Diego Costa scored the goals which set Chelsea apart but only the excellence of West Ham\u2019s goalkeeper, Adrian, prevented a rout. The opener was more brutal in its construction, Cesc Fabregas\u2019s corner flicked goalwards by Costa and the striker having lured Collins towards him, an unmarked Terry converted his 36th Premier League goal with ease. Cheikhou Kouyate duly lost the ball in midfield, Hazard slipped Costa free for the Brazil-born forward to tease space from Collins and Jenkinson before drilling a left-foot shot across Adrian and into the far corner for a 13th league goal of term.

Swansea was the architect of its own downfall at times, though, with Oscar profiting from a poor pass to open the scoring from 20 yards within the opening minute, and Costa opening his account with a composed finish. Mourinho's side was in total control and, after Eden Hazard saw a low shot saved, the Blues doubled their lead as Costa applied the finishing touch to a flowing move. Another two goals arrived before the break as Chelsea punished some more slack Swansea defending, the first coming when Costa pounced on Fernandez's weak back pass and the second \u2014 Chelsea's fourth \u2014 going in two minutes later. Willian powered through the Swansea midfield before finding Costa, whose cutback found Oscar \u2014 and the playmaker fired high into Fabianski's goal. The outcome was settled before half-time, by which stage Chelsea led 4-0, with their fans chanting the name of Diego Costa, whose two goals took his personal contribution to 17 in 19 League appearances. The League leaders were, by a street, the better, more cohesive unit and they deservedly doubled the lead in the 20th minute, when Cesc Fabregas and Willian created the opportunity for Costa to score with a dead-eyed finish from near the penalty spot. Then a dreadful back pass from Frederico Fernandez out on the right, gifted possession to Costa, who finished with aplomb, left to right.

Tottenham was then stunned as Ameobi fired home from Jack Colback's long ball to register his first top-flight goal for Newcastle, before Ayoze - who moved to St James' Park from Spanish second-tier side Tenerife in the close season - achieved the same feat when he headed home Cabella's floated delivery. Cabella curled a delightful delivery in from the left that Ayoze was able to nod home as Newcastle completed what had seemed a most unlikely comeback. Ameobi took what felt like a heartbeat to make his mark, fastening on to Jack Colback\u2019s long ball to shoot beyond Hugo Lloris \u2013 the equaliser was timed at six seconds into the second half \u2013 whereas Cabella took a positively leisurely 13 minutes before his cross teed up Ayoze Perez for what proved the winner. It was a day of firsts for Newcastle: this was Perez\u2019s full Premier League debut and the 21-year-old, who signed from Tenerife in the summer, could toast his first goal in the club\u2019s colours. The concession affected them badly and, when Perez scored Newcastle\u2019s second, the game looked like slipping beyond them. So Pardew promoted Perez and the visitors were fortunate to trail by only one at half-time. The travelling Newcastle fans, after the season they have had, might have been forgiven for pinching themselves but things got even better for them when Perez enjoyed his moment. But there was no flag and Perez stretched to meet Cabella\u2019s cross with an excellent glancing header. Christian Eriksen had gone close before Perez\u2019s goal but it was Newcastle who might have extended their lead when Cabella wriggled free on the byline but opted to shoot rather than cut back and the ball swelled the side of the net.",

        "\nEden Hazard was on target again as Manchester United was beaten 1-0 by Chelsea, which could be two wins from the title. Eden Hazard's 18th goal of the season ensured Chelsea took another giant stride toward winning the Premier League title by beating Manchester United 1-0 to move 10 points clear at the top of the table. Hazard demonstrated why he is a strong favorite to be crowned the PFA Player of the Year when he rounded off a slick move with a clinical finish to give Chelsea the lead during a first half in which the Blues were distinctly unimpressive. De Gea had very little to do in the first half, but he was picking the ball out of the net when Hazard opened the scoring out of the blue eight minutes before halftime. Falcao was robbed of possession by John Terry on the halfway line and Fabregas picked out Oscar, whose clever backheel set Hazard free and the winger surged into the area before firing under De Gea with his left foot. Didier Drogba almost doubled Chelsea's lead early in the second half when he raced away and went close with a deflected shot that looped over De Gea, and Hazard arrived beyond the back post to hit the crossbar from a tight angle. It also helps they have a left-sided attacker, Eden Hazard, who could feasibly finish the season with a clean sweep of the player-of-the-year awards. Hazard\u2019s contribution has been immense and it was his goal, late in the first half, that gave Chelsea the opportunity to show their qualities of endurance. And Hazard was what we know. Eden had that magic.\u201d\n \nMourinho seemed pretty pleased with himself too bearing in mind the tactical straightjacket that meant all of United\u2019s better performers recently \u2013 not just Fellaini but also Ashley Young, Juan Mata and Ander Herrera \u2013 were subdued. Hazard\u2019s goal came in the 38th minute. Not long before Hazard stuck his shot between David de Gea\u2019s legs, the possession statistics had flashed up that Chelsea had seen only 30% of the ball. Hazard\u2019s goal arrived just at the point Stamford Bridge was starting to feel a little anxious. Oscar\u2019s backheel was measured perfectly to leave Hazard scampering into the penalty area and the Belgian drew De Gea out of his goal before slotting in his shot.

        "\nJordan Henderson and Daniel Sturridge scored for Liverpool in a routine 2-0 home win over Burnley in the Premier League on Wednesday. Daniel Sturridge celebrated his return to Liverpool's starting lineup with a goal in a routine 2-0 home win over Burnley on Wednesday that saw Brendan Rodgers' side climb to fifth. Sturridge, who had started just one Premier League match since August, has been used sparingly by Rodgers in recent weeks. The England striker has battled thigh and calf issues throughout the season but after a series of recent involvement in cup competitions, the Liverpool boss declared Sturridge was ready to be a regular part of his Premier League first team again. Henderson - who scored for the second Premier League game in a row - pulled the strings in a dominant midfield performance and also provided the cross for Sturridge's header. Sturridge made an early statement of intent, going close in the first 30 seconds. Henderson tried to pass in a curling finish in the 24th minute, but again Heaton was equal to the task, before the shot-stopper rushed off his line to deny Sturridge following Michael Keane's poor defensive header. Coutinho then curled wide from distance before the Brazilian played in Sturridge on the stroke of halftime, but the latter's frustration continued when Heaton came off his line to save with a trailing leg. Sturridge finally got his goal in the second half, pouncing on some slack marking to head past Heaton at the near post following Henderson's cross. Not even Philippe Coutinho could eclipse the midfielder on this occasion and the 25-year-old embellished his night\u2019s work by creating the second goal for Daniel Sturridge. The recalled Sturridge tested Tom Heaton in the Burnley goal after 25 seconds and while that marked the start of a high-tempo contest it was not the signal for Liverpool to dominate against relegation-threatened visitors. Michael Keane almost gifted Sturridge an opener with a weak header from Emre Can\u2019s deflected shot but Heaton gathered just in time. Joe Allen and Coutinho went close to doubling Liverpool\u2019s lead from distance and Sturridge had the best opportunity for a second when played clear by a deft pass from the Brazilian midfielder. The threat level from Burnley did increase but, unfortunately for Dyche, only after Sturridge had extended Liverpool\u2019s advantage. Sturridge read the midfielder\u2019s intentions expertly and peeled away from his marker to steer a fine header inside Heaton\u2019s right-hand post.",

        "\nEden Hazard's goal was all League Cup winner Chelsea needed to beat London rival West Ham in the Premier League on Wednesday. The top-flight leader tasted Wembley joy at the weekend and Eden Hazard's first-half header proved enough to cap a winning return to league action, with Jose Mourinho's side staying five points ahead of Manchester City. Chelsea led 1-0 at the break thanks to Hazard's close-range header, although West Ham should have been level before the interval with Diafra Sakho nodding straight at Thibaut Courtois. Hazard impressed throughout and twice in the second half laid on great chances for Ramires, who was denied a goal by the frame of the post and a fine stop from Adrian. Hazard's pass to Cesc Fabregas was worked right to Ramires and his cross picked out the unmarked Belgium international to nod home from six yards. Chelsea had the chance to make it 2-0 when Hazard sent Costa free in a swift breakaway, but the striker dawdled on the ball and allowed Carl Jenkinson to make a fine tackle. Chelsea reasserted control from thereon and the excellent Hazard played Ramires in behind the defense. Psychologically, it would have been damaging had the slender lead secured by Eden Hazard\u2019s goal midway through the opening period been surrendered amid West Ham\u2019s avalanche of second-half chances.

        "This latest reverse came courtesy of Eden Hazard's first-half penalty and Diego Costa's ninth goal of the season, as Chelsea moved five points clear of nearest rival Manchester City at the top of the table. In what was a full-blooded match, Laurent Koscielny was perhaps fortunate not to be shown a red card for denying a clear goal-scoring opportunity in bringing down Hazard for Chelsea's spot kick, but Costa's sublime finish after a lofted pass from former Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas with 12 minutes left but the result beyond doubt. Finally, after 27 minutes, a moment of magic from Hazard led to Chelsea breaking the deadlock. Hazard, who scored a penalty in the 6-0 rout last season, calmly sent Wojciech Szczesny the wrong way from the spot. Chelsea almost doubled the lead shortly before the hour when Hazard's driven cross deflected off Mathieu Flamini and then the arm of Szczesny, before Arsenal felt it should have had a penalty when Wilshere's effort hit the arm of Fabregas, although it was unclear whether the incident had occurred inside the box. Hazard ought to have netted his and Chelsea's second when he fired off target from close range 14 minutes from time, but soon afterwards Costa made the game safe. Chelsea have won seven matches during that sequence and once we had waded through all the varying subplots and controversies the bottom line is the Premier League leaders have re-established a five-point advantage ahead of Manchester City \u2013 and gone nine clear of Arsenal \u2013 courtesy of Eden Hazard\u2019s expertly taken penalty and the latest demonstration of Diego Costa\u2019s penalty-box prowess. Equally, Laurent Koscielny should have been shown a red card for halting Hazard\u2019s brilliant run for his penalty, after the Belgian had already gone past Santi Cazorla and Calum Chambers and would have been running clear on goal if he had eluded a third man. Hazard had been a constant menace, flustering Arsenal to the extent that Mathieu Flamini strayed dangerously close to turning one of his crosses into his own net, and Wenger was entitled to be disappointed that his team did not do more to look for rustiness in Petr Cech, the replacement for Courtois.

        "\nTottenham once again toasted Harry Kane for prompting London derby celebrations as the striker hit a double to sink QPR 2-1 at Loftus Road. Harry Kane reveled in a London derby once more as his brace gave Tottenham a 2-1 Premier League win at QPR. In front of watching England boss Roy Hodgson at Loftus Road, Kane continued a stellar breakthrough season and moved his tally for the campaign to 26 goals in all competitions at club level. Eight of those have now comes in his last five Premier League London derbies, with generous QPR defending lending a hand to Kane's strikes in the 34th and 68th minutes. But it did not take long for Tottenham to find its rhythm and Rangers goalkeeper Rob Green made a magnificent point-blank save to deny Kane from Kyle Walker's right-wing cross. QPR rued those missed chances as Kane headed in from Andros Townsend's floated free kick, capitalizing on disorganized home defending with Green coming out to leave himself stranded. Tottenham began the second half brightly, with Christian Eriksen curling a strike against the post and Kane blasting the rebound off target. Midway through the second half, Tottenham's pressure eventually told as Kane sprung a sorry excuse for a QPR offside trap and coolly rounded Green to slot home. He might want to put that shot in an album alongside a portrait of Harry Kane, who delivered three points by scoring his 15th and 16th Premier League goals in a spectacular breakthrough season. The clash of the Premier League\u2019s top two English goalscorers was a subplot in this high-stakes showdown, and Roy Hodgson turned up to run the rule over Kane and Charlie Austin. In the sixth minute Kyle Walker presented Kane with an early opportunity to impress the watching England manager but instead Hodgson must have admired the reactions of Rob Green, who showed terrific reflexes to beat away the forward\u2019s close-range header. Nedum Onuoha, seemingly sensing his approach, ducked out of the way, but Green never got near the ball and Kane nodded it into the net unchallenged. Kane bungled the follow-up. Rio Ferdinand, having utterly lost his bearings, simply stopped, and Kane was allowed to canter into the box and around Green before slotting into the net.",

        "The Hawthorns club has endured a mixed start to life under Alan Irvine, but answered its critics with a defiant performance that was capped off with a headed goal from James Morrison. The teams continued to exchange chances with Morrison and Soldado testing Lloris and Foster respectively as the game opened up. But it was a set piece, rather than a swashbuckling counter, that handed West Brom the lead, with Morrison finding acres of space from Brunt's corner to head in unmarked. The goal came when James Morrison tip-toed on to Chris Brunt\u2019s corner to head unmarked into Hugo Lloris\u2019s net and begin an inquest among the Tottenham defence as to how such a diminutive midfielder might have done that. Irvine could revel in a clutch of excellent performances, chiefly from Morrison, the striker Saido Berahino and the centre-halves Craig Dawson and Joleon Lescott. Craig Gardner drew a smart save from Lloris after Morrison\u2019s square ball and Berahino\u2019s hard running worried the home defence. Dawson\u2019s flicked header from Morrison\u2019s corner on the half-hour sent the ball into Emmanuel Adebayor\u2019s outstretched hand and, if the Tottenham striker had little time to react, the hand was certainly a long way from being pinned to his side.

        "Wayne Rooney wrote his own headlines as Manchester United turned in a punch-perfect performance to defeat Tottenham 3-0 and strengthen the club's pursuit of a top-four Premier League finish. England and United captain Rooney headed into Sunday's match amid an unusual media storm after footage emerged of him being supposedly floored in a mock boxing bout with Stoke City fullback Phil Bardsley at his home. Rooney ensured he had the last laugh with a boxing-themed celebration when he put United 3-0 ahead in the 34th minute, completing a first half where nothing went right for the visiting side at Old Trafford. Nabil Bentaleb carelessly coughed up possession on halfway, allowing Rooney to tear through a retreating and disheveled Tottenham defense before firing home. Old Trafford rose to welcome a late Premier League debut for highly rated youngster Andreas Pereira, but it was an afternoon when long-time hero Rooney stole the limelight. Related: Wayne Rooney and Louis van Gaal play down boxing story after United win \n   \nAsked if this was United\u2019s best performance since he arrived, Van Gaal said: \u201cI have to watch the video again. By the time \u2013 after 34 minutes \u2013 that Rooney had scored a barnstorming third for United this was all forgotten. Rooney\u2019s fifth goal in six games came from a shocking ball from Nabil Bentaleb that went straight to the United captain. Now came the sight of the Rooney of yore, the England captain charging at the backpedalling Spurs rearguard before he made a mug of Eric Dier, removing him from the equation by swerving left and beating Hugo Lloris with a cool finish to the goalkeeper\u2019s right. Fellaini revealed that Rooney had given a rousing speech to the players at the team hotel on Saturday that was \u201cvery important\u201d and had inspired the squad. As with Rooney\u2019s goal, the Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino will be bitterly disappointed at his side\u2019s defending.

However, Liverpool goalkeeper Mignolet was alert to the danger and was also called into action on the stroke of halftime, doing well to tip a fizzing Schneiderlin effort over. And Clyne, who was allowed to run into the penalty area untracked by Lucas Leiva, hammered past Mignolet and into the top-right corner. It could have got worse for Liverpool when Ward-Prowse centered for a free Davis in the penalty area with the hosts in disarray at the back, but the Northern Ireland international could only shoot at Mignolet after an excellent team move. Rickie Lambert came off the bench to feature against his old club, but it was his strike partner, Sturridge, who stole in front of Clyne to score the winner, while Mignolet's heroics at the other end were just as crucial. Twelve months ago Liverpool laboured to three points against a team under new management courtesy of a Daniel Sturridge goal and an 89th-minute penalty save from Simon Mignolet.

Cesc Fabregas threaded a pass into Costa\u2019s stride and although the angle was difficult on the left side of the area, the use of Michael Dawson as a shield to unsight McGregor, and the accuracy of the curling effort combined for his 19th league goal of the season.",

Edin Dzeko and Yaya Toure both had sights of goal in the opening 15 minutes thanks to Clichy crosses but neither was able to stretch Mignolet. City\u2019s home record over the last three seasons incorporates only three defeats but Rodgers always sets up his side to take the game to the opposition and that meant Zabaleta and Gael Clichy, City\u2019s overlapping full-backs, were reluctant to break forward as much as usual. Clichy, in particular, had to worry about the pace and directness of Raheem Sterling but one of City\u2019s great strengths is the way they gang up on the opposition full-backs in wide positions and it was noticeable that when Zabaleta did start venturing forward more regularly it helped Jovetic to his second goal, turning in Samir Nasri\u2019s pass from the right.",

By the midway point of the first half, West Brom had settled comfortably into the contest and Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet saved well in the 35th minute when Berahino ran at a back-peddling home defense to unleash a vicious, swerving strike. Berahino headed wastefully over from close range as the interval approached and his frustration was compounded as Lallana put Liverpool ahead in the final minute of the first half. Not for the first time in the afternoon, Lovren struggled against Berahino's speed and movement, although he was unfortunate to see referee Michael Oliver point to the spot when he clattered through the forward. Berahino hammered home from the spot, but West Brom was only level for five minutes as Raheem Sterling regained his footing having gone to ground under Craig Gardner's challenge and fed Henderson to slot home. A wonderfully whipped cross from Chris Brunt prompted a poorly mistimed header by Berahino when well placed, leaving him without the second goal his boundless energy perhaps deserved. Saido Berahino brought a save from Simon Mignolet after Javier Manquillo inexplicably gave the ball away on half way, and might have done better with a free header from Sebastien Pocognoli\u2019s cross, three minutes before the interval, than put it wide. The penalty Dejan Lovren conceded to allow them back into the game was unnecessary and, quite possibly, outside the box, too, though the fact that the centre half had to stretch to prevent Berahino reaching Stephane Sessegnon\u2019s pass on the edge of the area showed the visitors were looking for a way back into the game.

        "\nThis season's leading Premier League goal scorer Sergio Aguero was on target again as Manchester City beat Tottenham at White Hart Lane. Sergio Aguero was the scourge of Tottenham once again as Manchester City won 1-0 at White Hart Lane on the day the side was dethroned as Premier League champion by Chelsea. Aguero scored all four goals in City's 4-1 home win over Tottenham in October and his first-half strike ensured he has now found the back of the net eight times in his last four games against the London club. Hugo Llloris had a huge stroke of luck when he slipped after coming out of his penalty area attempting to deal with a long ball, but Aguero was unable to take advantage as he also went down with the ball running away from him and, despite claims he had been upended by Federico Fazio, there was no contact from the defender. Aguero was not to be denied an opening goal 29 minutes in, though, as Tottenham way made to pay for some slack defending. Aguero really ought to have doubled the lead almost immediately, rounding Lloris with his first touch but firing into the side-netting with his second when off balance with the goal gaping. And so might Sergio Aguero. The Manchester City manager has now won four out of four against Tottenham and Aguero continues to excel against them. Aguero was not perfect but enough of what he did was close to it, particularly during a rampant first-half performance in which he scored the decisive goal. Aguero took a cute pass from David Silva following a rapier-like counter to blast high into Hugo Lloris\u2019 near corner. They got the job done here to end a damaging run of five consecutive away defeats but it spoke volumes that the goalkeeper, Joe Hart, ran Aguero close for the man of the match award. City, though, did not take long to advertise their threat and time and again it came from Aguero. There was controversy on 22 minutes when, after a long punt forward and a slip from Lloris, Aguero felt that he was tripped in the area by Federico Fazio. Fernandinho twice went close for City in the first half while Aguero worked Lloris after a breathtaking trick inside the area. Kane robbed Martin Demichelis only for Hart to crowd him out and block while Aguero took Fernandinho\u2019s cross around Lloris but, off-balance, he could not finish.

Issues surrounding Gerrard's future at Anfield dominated the build-up to Tuesday's match - where the former England skipper reverted to an advanced midfield role and scored the vital second goal for the visiting side. Adam Lallana restored parity shortly afterwards and Brendan Rodgers' side was ahead when skipper Gerrard - left out of the starting XI against Stoke City last Saturday - made no mistake with a calm finish after 54 minutes. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson named an unchanged XI, while Gerrard returned alongside Javier Manquillo and Lallana for Liverpool. The center back stretched to divert Sterling's cutback away from goal but he could only place the ball into the path of Gerrard, who clinically steered home side footed. Gerrard was unfortunate not to win a penalty when Schmeichel appeared to bring him down in the box soon after only for referee Lee Mason to wave his appeals away. But Liverpool's nerves were eased when Schmeichel failed to deal with a low Gerrard cross and Sterling teed up Henderson to mark his 150th appearance for the club with a simple finish. \nLeicester City 1-3 Liverpool | Premier League match report\n\n\nSo this is what Liverpool will be missing if Steven Gerrard calls time on his Anfield career. Rolling back the years in an advanced attacking role, Gerrard registered his first goal in 12 appearances as Liverpool gave their season a shot in the arm.

Gerrard was adamant that he should also have been awarded a penalty, when Kasper Schmeichel rushed from his line and collided with the Liverpool captain in the 73rd minute. Lee Mason waved away the appeals; Rodgers and Gerrard felt that the referee\u2019s thinking was influenced by the fact that pointing to the spot would almost certainly have meant a red card for Schmeichel and Leicester finishing the game with nine men. \u201cFor me it is a blatant penalty,\u201d Gerrard said.

        "John Terry and Diego Costa grabbed the goals in an impressive display as the fourth-placed visiting side was brushed aside at Stamford Bridge. That did not materialize in the opening period as Mourinho's men dominated, entering the break 1-0 ahead as Terry scored in back-to-back matches for the first time in a decade. Gary Cahill was next to threaten when rising high in the area to head over from center back partner Terry's clever chipped pass. The opening goal finally arrived in the 31st minute, as Terry tapped home after Costa had flicked on Fabregas' corner. John Terry and Diego Costa scored the goals which set Chelsea apart but only the excellence of West Ham\u2019s goalkeeper, Adrian, prevented a rout. The opener was more brutal in its construction, Cesc Fabregas\u2019s corner flicked goalwards by Costa and the striker having lured Collins towards him, an unmarked Terry converted his 36th Premier League goal with ease.

Dejan Lovren's header was then kept out by Ahmed Elmohamady on the line after nine minutes before Balotelli was denied by Jakupovic from a narrow angle, though Hull's third-choice goalkeeper, making a rare outing due to injuries to Allan McGregor and Steve Harper, was rarely tested. Liverpool dominated after the break and Balotelli looked set to register his first league goal for the club just after the hour but an acrobatic clearance from Brady kept the scores level and Sterling's firm effort on the rebound was gathered comfortably by Jakupovic. Balotelli brought a good save from Eldin Jakupovic after 12 minutes, sent Alberto Moreno galloping down the left wing with an elegant backheel a little later, and even passed to colleagues on occasions instead of shooting every time he received the ball. Dejan Lovren saw an early header from a corner saved, Balotelli tested Jakupovic\u2019s reactions again, and that was about it.

        "\nRadamel Falcao, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata missed golden chances as a match of early promise petered out. United \u2014 which named an unchanged lineup for a league match for the first time in more than two years \u2014 took charge after a frantic start and Radamel Falcao should have done better when Juan Mata played him in, but the Colombia striker got the ball stuck under his feet and his tame effort was comfortably saved by Lloris. Mata's deflected free kick struck the post and some great defending from Vlad Chiriches denied Van Persie the chance to tuck home the rebound after 21 minutes. Van Gaal made a substitution at the break, with Rafael da Silva replacing Antonio Valencia, and Van Persie had another great chance to put them in front nine minutes into the second half, but volleyed over the crossbar after Mata picked him out. United could have been out of sight if it had been more composed in front of goal and Mata blazed wildly over the bar from 10 yards out after 67 minutes when Rafael cut the ball back to the Spain midfielder. He referenced the chances that Radamel Falcao, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata missed across the piece yet it was in the first period that his team failed to capitalise. It was Van Gaal, not Pochettino, who could grumble about the fairness of the scoreline and his argument was based on a first half in which Mata excelled and Ashley Young made inroads from left wing-back.

        "Chelsea raced into a two-goal lead at the KC Stadium on Sunday courtesy of classy finishes from Eden Hazard and Diego Costa inside nine minutes. But Remy had the final say with his first touch after replacing Costa, and it was a moment to forget for Allan McGregor, as the striker's tame shot squirmed through his legs and into the net. Hazard scored a stunning goal at Hull last season and he took less than two minutes to hit another sublime effort, latching onto Costa's lay-off and surging forward before letting fly with his left foot to find the far corner with a classy 20-yard finish. Hernandez was wasteful when one-on-one soon after, and Hull was punished in the ninth minute as Cesc Fabregas picked out Costa and the Spain striker cut in from the left before picking his spot inside the far post in measured style. Costa, who moved level on 19 goals with Harry Kane in the race for the Premier League golden boot, was withdrawn clutching his hamstring 15 minutes from time but his replacement Remy won it almost immediately. Pegged back by a draw against Southampton seven days previously, recent history threatened to repeat itself before Remy replaced Diego Costa a quarter of an hour from the end and scuffed in the winner off Allan McGregor\u2019s boots a couple of minutes later to provide Chelsea with what Mourinho described as their most dominant position of the campaign. The first, dispatched from 20 yards by Eden Hazard\u2019s left boot, owed to a combination of home hesitancy once Costa\u2019s muscular lay-off cushioned the ball into the Belgian\u2019s path. Cesc Fabregas threaded a pass into Costa\u2019s stride and although the angle was difficult on the left side of the area, the use of Michael Dawson as a shield to unsight McGregor, and the accuracy of the curling effort combined for his 19th league goal of the season. If the finish was typical Costa, so unfortunately were the second-half antics in which his elbow appeared to connect with Jake Livermore during a prolonged tussle between the pair at a corner. Hull City manager Steve Bruce says his side is very disappointed after losing 3-2 to Chelsea    \nHowever, a recurrence of Costa\u2019s hamstring injury trouble may mean further reliance on Remy.",

        "Sergio Aguero's four-goal haul continued Manchester City's dominance over Tottenham with a 4-1 win at the Etihad Stadium. Both sides pounced on mistakes to score inside the opening 15 minutes, with Aguero the beneficiary of some sloppy play from Erik Lamela as City broke the deadlock. Aguero stroked home his second from the spot to become City's all-time leading Premier League scorer with 59 and restore the hosts' lead in the 20th minute. City spurned the chance to extend their advantage when Aguero saw a penalty saved by Hugo Lloris shortly after the half-hour mark, volleying the rebound over the bar, and Soldado followed suit in the second half as Joe Hart kept his penalty out. The game was put beyond Spurs when Aguero wrapped up his hat trick from yet another penalty, with Fazio's red card for hauling him down putting a blemish in his Premier League debut, and the City man added his fourth to take his top-flight tally for the season to nine. Eriksen should perhaps have hit the target from inside the area eight minutes in before Aguero made Lamela pay for his carelessness by shifting the ball quickly onto his right foot and curling an effort past Lloris. However, the visitors' response was almost immediate \u2014 Ryan Mason taking the ball off Fernando before Soldado's pass allowed Eriksen a clear sight of goal, his shot coming off Hart's knee and nestling into the net via the crossbar\n\nLamela's difficult half continued when he was harshly judged to have fouled Lampard inside the area, allowing Aguero to continue his fine form and surpass Carlos Tevez in terms of Premier League goals for the English champions. Lampard \u2014 one of the six to come into the City side \u2014 was forced off with an apparent thigh injury following a challenge from Mason before Aguero wasted the chance to wrap up a first-half hat trick. Aguero ensured his hat trick from the spot after Fazio brought him down inside the area, before adding to his tally with a smart curled finish late. \nManchester City 4-1 Tottenham Hotspur | Premier League match report\n\n\nWhen Mauricio Pochettino was asked before this match for his impressions of Sergio Aguero he compared it to the joys of listening to Mozart and Beethoven. Aguero\u2019s performance here could certainly have been set to music but, for Pochettino, it must have sounded like the blare of sirens whenever the Manchester City striker had the ball. Aguero terrorised his opponents, scored four times, missed a penalty and, in the process, caught and overhauled his compatriot Carlos Tevez\u2019s scoring record in City\u2019s colours. Aguero\u2019s 61 have come in 95 games and it is difficult to remember the last time one of City\u2019s players tormented the opposition so relentlessly and mercilessly. By the end, Younes Kaboul\u2019s limitations had been brutally exposed and Federico Fazio, his partner in central defence, had become so flustered that he tugged down Aguero for a red card. Aguero\u2019s first was a typical piece of excellence, taking a touch to elude Kaboul and then firing in a vicious, diagonal shot through a crowded penalty area. Aguero has now scored nine times in six games against Spurs and was so rampant here he might reflect he ought to have had more. This time, Aguero\u2019s penalty was struck poorly and when the rebound came back off Lloris he rushed his attempt at a bicycle kick and slashed the follow-up effort over the bar. Instead, Hart dived full-length to his right to keep out Soldado\u2019s penalty and within five minutes Fazio was trudging off the pitch and Aguero was about to make it 3-1 with his third spot-kick. The only absolute certainty was that Spurs were permanently vulnerable in defence and Aguero was not in the mood to be charitable. They were indebted to Hart\u2019s goalkeeping and Fernando made a bad mistake to lose the ball in the moments before Christian Eriksen lashed in to make it 1-1 a minute after Aguero\u2019s goal. Aguero took the match-ball home as a souvenir and when he is playing with this menace City give the impression they could trouble the world\u2019s best defences, never mind one as obliging as Tottenham\u2019s.\n\n\n",

Baines was judged to have fouled Balotelli 25 yards from goal and Gerrard stepped up to curl the resulting free kick over the wall and beyond Howard, who got his left hand to the ball but could not keep it out. A predictably frantic first 20 minutes were dominated by Liverpool, who had the Everton penalty area under siege from the outset and were only kept out by Tim Howard\u2019s reactions and Gareth Barry\u2019s spiky resilience.

England Under-21 defender Dier, a close-season acquisition from Sporting Lisbon, found himself on the end of Harry Kane's measured through ball to round goalkeeper Adrian and coolly convert.

If Noble had scored, West Ham probably would have won and the boos would not have rung around Upton Park when Chris Foy blew for full-time moments after Eric Dier had given Mauricio Pochettino a perfect start as Tottenham\u2019s manager. This time they stood firm and stunned West Ham when Dier, 20, the defender who was signed from Sporting Lisbon in the summer, burst on to Harry Kane\u2019s pass in stoppage time, rounded Adrian and tapped the ball into the empty net.

The France international came off the bench to secure all three points to the delight of a packed home crowd, Remy converting his first after a superb run from Eden Hazard and adding a second in the closing minutes. Remy could have had his name on the scoresheet much earlier, but he spurned two excellent chances before finally accepting the third to register his sixth of the campaign.

Remy added a third late on with a deft finish from close range as the champions rounded off the campaign in fitting fashion. Another substitute, Loic Remy, scored twice after the interval to ensure the third highest points tally in this club\u2019s history, even if it was Drogba, returning to the pitch post-match, who claimed the match ball as his own.

        "A Harry Kane-inspired Tottenham side dropped London rival Chelsea into a tie at the Premier League summit with a spectacular 5-3 win. But it was another striker who truly illuminated the contest, with Kane brilliantly equalizing after 30 minutes and winning a penalty that Andros Townsend converted moments after Danny Rose gave Tottenham a 45th-minute lead. A 3-1 halftime advantage became 4-1 eight minutes into the second period when Kane excelled once more to chalk up a sixth goal in his past six games and 16th of the season overall. As has so often been the case during its recent impressive run, Tottenham looked to Kane for inspiration and he answered the call in style. Kane was involved once more in stoppage time, stealing in front of Gary Cahill to draw a foul and leaving the England center back to watch international colleague Townsend thrash a low penalty beyond Courtois' dive. Ramires came on for compatriot Oscar at the break and Hazard blasted over from the edge of the area before Kane sublimely took center stage once more. Seizing possession with his back to goal, Kane spun past Nemanja Matic and slotted an effortless finish past the helpless Courtois. Kane and Chadli combined for the latter to cut in from the left and steer home another finish. Memories of this riotous occasion will sustain Harry Kane through the winter. Gary Cahill has quelled the threat of Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez at times during his career, but Kane left him dazed and confused. In truth, the entire Chelsea defence appeared flustered and uncharacteristically vulnerable, disconcerted by the aggressive running of Chadli and Andros Townsend down the flanks but, most of all, by Kane\u2019s excellence. Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s Harry Kane celebrates his equaliser. Chelsea were still wheezing in disbelief when Cahill upended Kane as the striker appeared on his blindside.

The excellent Carrick was one of three players to come into the United lineup following Monday night's dispiriting FA Cup quarterfinal loss to Arsenal, alongside Juan Mata and Phil Jones, while Danny Rose was preferred to Ben Davies at left back in Tottenham's only change. There was an initially nervy start from United as David de Gea spared Jones from an embarrassing own goal in the third minute following a rash back pass. Phil Jones was the culprit, the defender\u2019s heavy backpass requiring David de Gea to scramble and stick out a boot to prevent an own goal. A few shadow punches and a fall backwards in jest at being knocked out by Stoke City\u2019s Phil Bardsley in the kitchen last month.",

Chelsea almost doubled the lead shortly before the hour when Hazard's driven cross deflected off Mathieu Flamini and then the arm of Szczesny, before Arsenal felt it should have had a penalty when Wilshere's effort hit the arm of Fabregas, although it was unclear whether the incident had occurred inside the box. He ran onto Fabregas' pass and lobbed a deft finish over the advancing Szczesny. Danny Welbeck was perhaps lucky to only receive a yellow card for a two-footed lunge on Fabregas in stoppage time as Arsenal desperately chased the game, but Chelsea comfortably held on to secure maximum points. The referee, Martin Atkinson, could feasibly have shown four red cards and his leniency was starting to feel absurd when Danny Welbeck lunged in two-footed on Cesc Fabregas during the closing exchanges and it was deemed worthy only of a booking. Wenger was justified in saying it was a red-card offence and he could also reflect on the moment, at 1-0, when Fabregas threw himself at Jack Wilshere\u2019s shot and the ball deflected off his hands inside the penalty area only for Atkinson to wave play on. Chambers could feasibly have been dismissed for two bookable offences before half-time and Welbeck\u2019s studs-up challenge on Fabregas was an even more obvious sending-off than Cahill\u2019s. It has become a recurring theme when these sides lock horns and the deja vu for Arsenal was compounded by the fact it was the brilliantly influential Fabregas playing the ball for Costa to run clear and lob Wojciech Szczesny in the 78th minute.",

John Terry's headed opener from a Fabregas corner with less than two minutes played gave Chelsea something to defend, and Stoke rarely looked like finding a way through the visitor's determined defensive line. Chelsea, for its part, often looked dangerous on the break after going ahead but was unable to build on its breakthrough until Fabregas's scuffed shot 12 minutes from time. Terry shrugged off Geoff Cameron in the box to get his head to a Fabregas corner and deal the host an early blow \u2013 the Spaniard providing a 12th assist of the season. Asmir Begovic did well to get down to his right to keep out a Willian strike early in the second period before clinging onto a soft Fabregas strike after Hazard had managed to force the ball into the six-yard box. However, Fabregas had the final say, diverting the ball into the back of the net after being played in by Hazard, who limped off late on after a tackle from Jonathan Walters, although there was an element of fortune about his finish. John Terry\u2019s header after only 95 seconds, followed by a second-half goal from Cesc Fabregas, secured their place at the summit and restored their three-point advantage over Manchester City.

        "But a moment of brilliance from Eden Hazard shortly before the break leveled proceedings, as he curled home his seventh league goal of the campaign. Yet the visitors restored parity on the stroke of half-time with a fine finish from Hazard. Creator-in-chief Fabregas showed great vision to play a delicate chip into the path of Hazard in the left channel, who cut inside Belgium colleague Toby Alderweireld and bent a fierce shot into the far corner. The visitors continued to press and Fabregas once again teed up Hazard on the hour, but this time he flashed wide of the right-hand post, while Didier Drogba was introduced to add muscle to Chelsea's attack. Cesc Fabregas and Eden Hazard played virtually every pass in those 45 minutes apart from the killer one and their frustrations did not stop there on a day when two bookable offences by Morgan Schneiderlin meant Southampton had to get through the last couple of minutes of normal time, plus another four for stoppages, a man down. Hazard, such a menace throughout the second period, was subdued in the opening half an hour and Matt Targett, one of the teenagers from Southampton\u2019s conveyor belt of seemingly endless young talent, had slotted in so harmoniously that his direct opponent, Andre Schurrle, was substituted by Willian at half-time. Chelsea took their time to get going but the pattern of the game changed in first-half stoppage time when Fabregas lifted the ball into the path of Hazard, running through the inside-left channel, and the Belgian was set free for the first time. Hazard, wanting the ball on his right foot, still had plenty to do and had to cut inside the full-back, Maya Yoshida, as well as the nearer centre-half, Toby Alderweireld. Diego Costa had one of his least productive games and, for all the menace of Hazard and Fabregas, Fraser Forster in Southampton\u2019s goal was surprisingly underworked given how much time the ball spent in and around his penalty area. Alderweireld showed again what a fine centre-half he is and Ronald Koeman made a sensible decision to replace a tiring Yoshida given that the defender was facing the elusive Hazard and had already been booked. Costa lost his footing when he had the opportunity to run clear and the home side held on after Schneiderlin\u2019s foul on Fabregas, following an earlier booking for one on Hazard, left them a man down during the final exchanges.

Liverpool were missing the pace and penetration of the rested Raheem Sterling, yet that could hardly be offered as an excuse for the difficulty they were experiencing defending set pieces. Brendan Rodgers watched Liverpool\u2019s attacks being comfortably repulsed by the outstanding Baker and the rest of the visiting defence for 15 minutes of the second half before sending on Sterling, who was welcomed to the game by a scything tackle from Hutton for which the Villa full-back was rightly booked. Sterling beat Cleverley with his first chance to run at Villa with the ball at his feet, only to produce a shot that landed in the middle of the Kop.",

        "Misfiring striker Mario Balotelli was dropped to the bench as Rickie Lambert came in to lead the Liverpool attack, while Costa Rica international Cristian Gamboa made a first Premier League start at right back for West Brom with Andre Wisdom unavailable to face his parent club. Liverpool was determined not to give its visitors another route back into the contest, with Sterling to the fore, and the winger skipped past Joleon Lescott to draw a vital block from Pocognoli before the recently introduced Balotelli then lashed wide. West Brom pressed in spirited fashion late, while Foster saved with his legs in stoppage time to ensure Balotelli's wait for a first league goal for Liverpool goes on. Brendan Rodgers had responded to a fourth Liverpool defeat in the opening nine games by dropping Mario Balotelli and Lazar Markovic to the bench, the former carrying the can \u2013 a little unfairly \u2013 for a poor overall team performance in Basel, the latter having failed to make a significant impression on English football since signing from Benfica. Rickie Lambert did not really step up to the plate as line leader in Balotelli\u2019s absence, failing to connect with an early cross from Lallana, and too often finding his first touch letting him down. The former Southampton striker did bring the first save of the game from Ben Foster, midway through the first half, after neatly controlling a searching pass from Martin Skrtel, though \u2013 when he took too long over his next penalty-area opportunity, and saw the chance disappear \u2013 it was hard to see how Lambert was bringing any more mobility to the Liverpool attack than Balotelli. With Balotelli already on for the last half hour, the stage was set for Liverpool to put the game to bed and possibly score a few more confidence-boosting goals in the process, yet things are just not happening for them as smoothly this season as they did last. When Balotelli sent Sterling clear on goal with a precisely timed pass, the England player popped up in the right place and showed all the necessary acceleration, only to see the chance go begging when an unwanted touch showed too much of the ball to the goalkeeper. While Balotelli and Steven Gerrard both saw shots saved before the end, West Brom refused to collapse, and the score remained the same. \n\n\n",

The visitors' task was made easier in the second half thanks to Gerrard's moment of madness, with Mata subsequently doubling United's advantage with a goal that on another day would likely have stolen the headlines. After a cagey start, a moment of brilliance from United broke the deadlock in the 14th minute, as Mata silenced the home fans with a goal at The Kop end.

Juan Mata\u2019s brilliant second goal arrived just before the hour and at that stage Liverpool might have been excused for thinking the game had become an exercise in damage limitation. Mata was superb, with Herrera not far behind, whereas Liverpool\u2019s lack of discipline was accompanied by some of the flaws that undermined them earlier in the season. Herrera played in a way that made it seem absurd he has found it so difficult to get a place in the team and Mata looked absolutely determined to shape the match from his new position, in Van Gaal\u2019s words, as a \u201cfalse right-winger\u201d.

        "\nTwo goals in two minutes from David Nugent and Jeffrey Schlupp earns bottom side Leicester a point at Anfield as they cancel out two goals from Steven Gerrard. Resurgent Liverpool looked to be heading for a third consecutive Premier League victory when two Steven Gerrard penalties put the club in command at halftime on New Year's Day. Gerrard, who also scored in Liverpool's 3-1 win at Leicester last month, tucked home the resulting spot kick and struck again from 12 yards after Danny Simpson had handled. Gerrard made no mistake with the resulting spot kick, which he buried into the bottom-right corner of the net. Leicester had every right to feel hard done by with Liverpool's first penalty, but there was no doubt Simpson handled when referee Jones pointed to the spot five minutes before the break and the fullback was punished when Gerrard sent Ben Hamer the wrong way from 12 yards out. Jordan Henderson almost had a contender for goal of the season when he showed great technique to meet a Gerrard corner with a volley that flew narrowly wide shortly before the break. That should be enough to play the game out but we made too many mistakes.\u201d\n \nSteven Gerrard scored the two penalties \u2013 the first a joke, the second justified \u2013 as Leicester players railed at Jones and their coaching staff gathered at the top of the tunnel to berate the referee at half-time. The referee, who has the \u2018beach ball\u2019 goal against Liverpool among his litany of errors, decided otherwise and Gerrard, back in the starting lineup having been rested against Swansea, converted the penalty to the left of the goalkeeper Ben Hamer. Jones called it right, Hamer dived the same way from the spot-kick but Gerrard went the other.",

Chelsea had fallen behind in the first half as Steven Fletcher netted his first league goal since November, but Diego Costa cancelled that out from the spot. As the half-hour approached, Chelsea failed to deal with a right-wing corner, the ball bounced inside the six-yard box and Fletcher made no mistake at the back post.

        "However, the Brazilian was speared by the Arsenal goalkeeper and, after the effort was cleared away by Hector Bellerin, Chelsea's frustrations were clear as referee Michael Oliver opted against awarding a spot kick and brandishing a possible red card. Arsenal edged the initial stages, although Chelsea felt it should have earned an early penalty seven minutes in when Oscar went down under pressure from Bellerin. Bellerin was then required to clear Oscar's goal-bound effort following a sublime ball from Fabregas, with Ospina's foul on the forward failing to merit sanctions. Hector Bellerin prevented Oscar\u2019s looping effort from bouncing into the goal and Chelsea had every right to argue it should have been a penalty. Oscar can just about be given the benefit of the doubt after an optimistic fall in front of Bellerin but Cesc Fabregas deserved all the condemnation that came his way when he wafted his leg in the direction of Santi Cazorla, then plopped to the ground in the vain hope that the referee, Michael Oliver, might be conned. Aaron Ramsey\u2019s link-up play with the overlapping Bellerin was another feature but, with less of the ball, Mourinho\u2019s team still created the best chances of that period.",

Costa has been nursing a hamstring problem, but there were no signs of an injury as he continued his outstanding start to his Chelsea career by finding the back of the net with a towering second-half header Saturday. Costa doubled the lead just before the hour-mark and Willian added the third with a tap-in, his first goal of the season, to round off another impressive display from free-scoring Chelsea, which has now notched 19 goals in its first six top-flight games. Chelsea was dominant and Willian laid on another chance when he picked out Costa with a cross, but the Brazil-born striker's powerful header was saved by Guzan. Baker rose highest to meet a free kick, but headed onto the roof of the net and Costa ought to have made him pay when he failed to get a good contact on his header after Branislav Ivanovic picked him out. Willian then got his name on the score sheet, converting from point-blank range after Costa's shot was saved by Guzan 11 minutes from time. \nChelsea 3-0 Aston Villa | Premier League match report\n\n\nAgainst Arsenal last week Aston Villa\u2019s team had been laid low by a virus; this time they were brought to their knees by a phenomenon they found similarly impossible to defend against and equally destructive to their morale and their victory chances, in the rather more human shape of Diego Costa. Jose Mourinho said that goals were of particular importance for Costa given that he is doing \u201calmost nothing\u201d in training. \u201cBut I know it\u2019s good for him and for his confidence, especially for a player like him who\u2019s not training as he should, so he cannot be on top of his game.\u201d\n \nHaving complained earlier in the week that Spain remain free to select Costa despite his injury concerns, Mourinho now pinpointed the period next month in which they have back-to-back qualifiers against Slovakia and Luxembourg as key to Costa\u2019s long-term fortunes for club and country. Willian came close to a second in the 15th minute when he ran on to Costa\u2019s excellent backheel flick and set off down the centre but Nathan Baker diligently shepherded him wide of goal, from where his shot was deflected the wrong side of the near post. \u201cThe team always gave the feeling that everything was under control.\u201d\n \nAll the more so when, in the 59th minute, the Villa defence was momentarily mesmerised by some neat triangular passing on the left and forgot to keep an eye on Costa, who scored with a powerful header when Cesar Azpilicueta finally speared in a cross. Twenty minutes later, Aly Cissokho having in the meantime cleared Oscar\u2019s casual effort as it rolled towards the line, Costa was found in too much space on the left, from where he cut inside, cut inside a little more and then sent in a shot that bounced off Guzan and Cissokho before landing helpfully between Willian and an empty net.\n\n\n",

Sunderland tried to reply immediately and appealed for a penalty when Defoe went down under a challenge from Vertonghen.

Fortune then turned in Sunderland\u2019s favour and perhaps it bodes well that Defoe was involved.

Markovic was at the center of Liverpool's best play and also struck the woodwork with an acrobatic effort, while ex-Sunderland loanee Fabio Borini was wayward with his shot from a tight angle after rounding Costel Pantilimon in a dominant first half for Brendan Rodgers' side. Liverpool started brightly and felt it should have been awarded a penalty when Markovic took a tumble under a clumsy challenge from Wes Brown after four minutes, with referee Craig Pawson unmoved. But Markovic, one of three Liverpool changes from the New Year's Day draw against Leicester City, soon capped a swift break with the opening goal. Having initially taken possession out wide on the right, Markovic played the ball inside and continued his run before being picked out by Borini's toe-poked pass. The Romanian goalkeeper was beaten by Markovic's improvised 29th-minute volley, but the ball came back off the crossbar and went out for a corner via Pantilimon's elbow. With Lazar Markovic excelling in a howling wind, a significantly under-strength Liverpool enhanced their hopes of a top-four push while Gus Poyet contemplated another painful struggle against relegation. Some players are taking a long time to learn the basics of how I\u00a0play.\u201d\n \nLiverpool should have had a very early penalty but Craig Pawson refused to accept that Wes Brown had blatantly brought Markovic down in the area.

        "\nBen Mee's header earned Premier League struggler Burnley a surprise point from a 1-1 draw at 10-man Chelsea on Saturday. Premier League struggler Burnley earned a shock 1-1 draw at 10-man Chelsea thanks to Ben Mee's late header at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Seemingly buoyed by that sending off, Burnley snatched an equalizer with nine minutes to go as Mee rose highest to head in Kieran Trippier's left-wing corner. However, from the resulting corner, Mee headed home to spark scenes of jubilation among Burnley players and fans alike. Chelsea were leading at that point thanks to Branislav Ivanovic\u2019s goal in the first half but Burnley equalised against the 10 men when Ben Mee headed in from a corner nine minutes from time. Mourinho sought to shore up midfield and was intending to introduce Gary Cahill for Costa in the 81st minute as Burnley lined up a corner following a fine save by Courtois from another Barnes shot, but he could not make the change in time and had to watch aghast as Mee rose above Ramires and headed Trippier\u2019s delivery into the net.",

Palace should have been level in the 29th minute when Bolasie outmuscled Dejan Lovren to send in a low cross from the right.

Earlier, Herrera had set up Mata for the opening goal with a superb pass as United suffocated a Liverpool side that had not lost a league game since its 3-0 defeat at Old Trafford in December. The Spaniard timed his run to perfection to meet a superb through ball from compatriot Herrera and coolly slotted his shot across the face of goal into the bottom-left corner.

        "\nTottenham striker Harry Kane scored his first Premier League hat trick as Spurs downed Leicester City at White Hart Lane on Saturday. Harry Kane celebrated his first senior England call-up by scoring his maiden Premier League hat trick as Tottenham beat Leicester City 4-3 in an enthralling encounter at White Hart Lane. Former Leicester loanee Kane was included in Roy Hodgson's squad for the upcoming internationals against Lithuania and Italy, and the England manager was in the stands to watch the striker's latest match-winning contribution on Saturday. Kane put the home side back in front, though, slotting home from the penalty spot to become the leading scorer in the Premier League with 19 goals, and a Jeffrey Schlupp own goal restored Tottenham's two-goal cushion. Michel Vorm came on to make his Premier League debut for Spurs, who were in front after only six minutes courtesy of yet another goal from Kane. Leicester was caught out when Andros Townsend's corner was cleverly flicked on by Eric Dier and Kasper Schmeichel - making his first start in 2015 - palmed the ball straight at Kane, who finished from inside the six-yard box. The German defender intervened to cut out Walker's cutback, but his heavy touch fell invitingly for Kane and the man of the moment's scuffed shot hit Huth and looped into the far corner of the net. Kane sent Schmeichel the wrong way from the spot to complete his hat trick. \nTottenham Hotspur 4-3 Leicester City | Premier League match report\n\n\nHurricane Harry Kane blew in from the south side here after six minutes and, by the time that this force of nature had departed, he had his first Premier League hat-trick and Tottenham Hotspur had the result that they wanted after Sunday\u2019s drubbing at Manchester United. Kane spent the later part of the 2012-13 season on loan at Leicester City, where he managed two goals in 13 Championship appearances and the speed of his progress remains difficult to comprehend. Related: Newcastle United 1-2 Arsenal | Premier League match report \n   \nKane\u2019s heroics, however, were only a part of this helter-skelter, error-strewn encounter in which Leicester contributed fully.

        "Loic Remy had replaced Costa in the starting lineup and, just as he did at Hull City last time out, the France striker scored the winner following a mistake from the otherwise outstanding Asmir Begovic as Chelsea continued its march toward regaining the title. Remy wasted no time in making his presence felt, as he almost put Chelsea in front with a deflected strike that was destined for the top corner until Begovic somehow scrambled across to make an impressive reflex save just two minutes in. The recalled Philipp Wollscheid rashly dived in on Cesc Fabregas after being beaten by the Spain midfielder and Hazard sent Begovic the wrong way after referee Jonathan Moss had pointed to the spot. Costa replaced Oscar at halftime and normal service was resumed, as Hazard's drive forced Begovic to make another fine save and the Stoke keeper again reacted brilliantly to keep out a free kick from Willian that appeared to flick off Glenn Whelan's head. Chelsea's frustration was mounting by that stage, but Begovic undid his good work by gifting the Blues a second goal. Chelsea's joy was almost shortlived, as Steven N'Zonzi clipped the outside of the post soon after Remy had struck, while Begovic made a fine double save to deny Juan Cuadrado at the other end as the leaders secured another three points. The Frenchman\u2019s decisive goal here was a gift from the otherwise excellent Asmir Begovic, the goalkeeper rolling the ball towards Steven Nzonzi only for Willian to intercept. Chelsea had laboured at times without him in that first period, Begovic denying them reward from an urgent opening and Stoke rugged and organised until self-destructing with half-time in sight. He should have supplied Juan Cuadrado with a third before the end only for the Colombian, offered a rare cameo, to strike Begovic with a point-blank shot and then with the rebound when it appeared easier to score.",
