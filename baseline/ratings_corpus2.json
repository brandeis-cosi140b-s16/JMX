Drogba\u2019s goal was a particularly traumatic one for Spurs to concede given that it came from nothing more elaborate than Hugo Lloris miscuing a routine kick, not even getting the ball to the midway point of his own half and leaving himself hopelessly exposed as Oscar and Hazard set up the man filling in for Costa. Drogba might not be the player he once was but this was a gift and Lloris took a long time to shake his head clear.

        "\nTwo goals from Saido Berahino and one from Chris Brunt saw West Brom defeat 10-man Chelsea in the Premier League. Saido Berahino's brace either side of a bizarre Cesc Fabregas red card helped to condemn champion Chelsea to only its third Premier League defeat of the season as West Brom claimed a 3-0 win at The Hawthorns on Monday. Back in the Albion side after starting on the bench at Newcastle last time out, Berahino netted his first goal in 10 games in all competitions with a fine early opener and followed that with a penalty just after halftime after being upended by John Terry. Berahino took just nine minutes to repay Pulis' decision to recall him by putting Albion ahead in some style. Joleon Lescott rolled a simple pass that Berahino turned and ran on to before escaping the attentions of Gary Cahill and rifling right-footed into Courtois' bottom left-hand corner from 25 yards out. The drama continued straight after the interval as Terry bundled Berahino over in the box to concede a penalty within 30 seconds of the restart. A full-stretch Courtois got a hand to Berahino's spot kick, but it nestled in the bottom corner to make it 20 goals for the season in all competitions for the England Under-21 international and 14 in the league.",

Swansea was the architect of its own downfall at times, though, with Oscar profiting from a poor pass to open the scoring from 20 yards within the opening minute, and Costa opening his account with a composed finish. Mourinho's side was in total control and, after Eden Hazard saw a low shot saved, the Blues doubled their lead as Costa applied the finishing touch to a flowing move. Another two goals arrived before the break as Chelsea punished some more slack Swansea defending, the first coming when Costa pounced on Fernandez's weak back pass and the second \u2014 Chelsea's fourth \u2014 going in two minutes later. Willian powered through the Swansea midfield before finding Costa, whose cutback found Oscar \u2014 and the playmaker fired high into Fabianski's goal.",

Jose Mourinho said that goals were of particular importance for Costa given that he is doing \u201calmost nothing\u201d in training. \u201cBut I know it\u2019s good for him and for his confidence, especially for a player like him who\u2019s not training as he should, so he cannot be on top of his game.\u201d\n \nHaving complained earlier in the week that Spain remain free to select Costa despite his injury concerns, Mourinho now pinpointed the period next month in which they have back-to-back qualifiers against Slovakia and Luxembourg as key to Costa\u2019s long-term fortunes for club and country. Willian came close to a second in the 15th minute when he ran on to Costa\u2019s excellent backheel flick and set off down the centre but Nathan Baker diligently shepherded him wide of goal, from where his shot was deflected the wrong side of the near post. \u201cThe team always gave the feeling that everything was under control.\u201d\n \nAll the more so when, in the 59th minute, the Villa defence was momentarily mesmerised by some neat triangular passing on the left and forgot to keep an eye on Costa, who scored with a powerful header when Cesar Azpilicueta finally speared in a cross. Twenty minutes later, Aly Cissokho having in the meantime cleared Oscar\u2019s casual effort as it rolled towards the line, Costa was found in too much space on the left, from where he cut inside, cut inside a little more and then sent in a shot that bounced off Guzan and Cissokho before landing helpfully between Willian and an empty net.\n\n\n",

        "A late strike from Willian ensured Chelsea beat Everton 1-0 at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday to remain seven points clear at the top of the Premier League. Tim Howard looked set to deny the leaders victory on his return from injury, but the Everton goalkeeper was unable to keep out a deflected strike from Brazil midfielder Willian just a minute from time in a dramatic finale. Eden Hazard, Willian and Nemanja Matic were all thwarted by the former Manchester United man and Branislav Ivanovic had a late goal disallowed for offside, before Willian secured an 11th win from 12 top-flight home games. Romelu Lukaku was denied by a fine save from the recalled Petr Cech and also went close in the first half for the visitor, which had Gareth Barry sent off for a second bookable offense just before Willian struck. Fellow midfielder Willian went even closer with a dipping shot from just outside the penalty area, before Lukaku almost struck at the other end against his former club when he raced into the box. The busy Howard again demonstrated why Martinez was so eager to recall him when he produced a diving stop to keep out a measured Willian effort, before Cech showed his class at the other end to thwart an unmarked Lukaku. Barry was then dismissed for a challenge on Willian which sparked a mass confrontation, and there was more drama to come, as Howard fisted away a cross into Willian's path and he rifled home with the aid of a defletion to stun Everton.",

        "\nEden Hazard's goal was all League Cup winner Chelsea needed to beat London rival West Ham in the Premier League on Wednesday. The top-flight leader tasted Wembley joy at the weekend and Eden Hazard's first-half header proved enough to cap a winning return to league action, with Jose Mourinho's side staying five points ahead of Manchester City. Chelsea led 1-0 at the break thanks to Hazard's close-range header, although West Ham should have been level before the interval with Diafra Sakho nodding straight at Thibaut Courtois. Hazard impressed throughout and twice in the second half laid on great chances for Ramires, who was denied a goal by the frame of the post and a fine stop from Adrian. Hazard's pass to Cesc Fabregas was worked right to Ramires and his cross picked out the unmarked Belgium international to nod home from six yards. Chelsea had the chance to make it 2-0 when Hazard sent Costa free in a swift breakaway, but the striker dawdled on the ball and allowed Carl Jenkinson to make a fine tackle. Chelsea reasserted control from thereon and the excellent Hazard played Ramires in behind the defense.",

Costa was back in the thick of it before the hour mark as he saw penalty appeals waved away following a tangle with Jose Fonte before diverting Willian's wayward strike onto Forster's post.

Costa had a running argument with Seamus Coleman and then Howard and took out his anger with his goals. Chelsea\u2019s third goal came from a Hazard cross that Coleman deflected into his own net and that was the moment Costa apparently said something to taunt the Everton defender, bringing an incensed Howard out of his goalmouth to confront him. Howard was shown a yellow card and for the rest of the match Costa seemed intent on prolonging the argument with Everton\u2019s goalkeeper.

The visiting side dominated possession in the first half and had its first sight of goal after 10 minutes, when Willian fired narrowly wide of Elliot's goal after good work from Costa and Eden Hazard. Chances continued to come for Chelsea but Willian was again guilty of missing a great opening 18 minutes with a curling effort 18 minutes in, before Cesc Fabregas saw a low shot deflected wide.",

        "Saido Berahino's brace either side of a bizarre Cesc Fabregas red card helped to condemn champion Chelsea to only its third Premier League defeat of the season as West Brom claimed a 3-0 win at The Hawthorns on Monday. Fabregas was given his marching orders in between the striker's double for petulantly kicking the ball at Chris Brunt during a stoppage in play after the fit-again Diego Costa and Gareth McAuley grappled in the box. In a lively start, Thibaut Courtois got down well to turn Callum McManaman's angled drive behind and Fabregas evaded two tackles as he slalomed into the penalty area at the opposite end before firing straight at Boaz Myhill. Just 29 minutes in, Fabregas was dismissed in unusual circumstances. Fabregas, all on his own on the opposite side of the penalty area, inexplicably struck the dead ball back into the crowd of players and into the back of Brunt's head, prompting Jones to brandish a straight red.",
