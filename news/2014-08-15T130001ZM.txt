b'<p>Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez will probably go down as an all-time great at Liverpool but his behaviour over the past three years means that he cannot be trusted and I am not sad to see him go. I was very critical of him when he bit Branislav Ivanovic and they could have sold him then. Although he is a brilliant talent and quite possibly irreplaceable in an individual sense, managers need players who are reliable and there have been too many incidents involving Su\xc3\xa1rez that reflected badly on the club. I do not care how many goals he scores, Liverpool have done well to get so much money for him from Barcelona.</p> <p>The club lives on and it is not like he is leaving a team that has won the league and the Champions League in the past two years. People forget that he won one League Cup at Liverpool and while he did fantastic things, what would have been possible if he had not missed so many games? Yes, he scored 31 goals last season but he also missed the first five league games and they ended up dropping points against Swansea City and Southampton without him. If he had been available, they probably would have been champions.</p> <p>Can you replace a player like Su\xc3\xa1rez? Probably not, because he is such a huge influence, but a team such as Liverpool will always create chances and they just need someone to finish them off. There will be pressure on Daniel Sturridge and players with extra responsibility. If they have anything about them, they will rise to the challenge and I recall that when Thierry Henry left Arsenal, everyone thought they were finished. Instead they scored more goals and almost won the league. You have to share the goals around. It makes a team harder to predict.</p> <p>I am happy with the players Liverpool have signed, although they still need a centre-forward. At the moment, they have only Rickie Lambert and Sturridge, with Divock Origi going back to Lille on loan. Lambert and Adam Lallana have shown they can play in the Premier League; Emre Can and Lazar Markovic still have to do that but they are very exciting. I think Can is going to do well and he has already made a big impression. He is a very clever player, a good passer of the ball and a big boy. He has all the ingredients to be a success at Liverpool. There is no shame in not making it at Bayern Munich with the players they have but he went to Bayer Leverkusen and played a lot of games out of position because they had injuries. His best position is probably in the holding role. Hopefully Steven Gerrard carries on for another two years or so but once Stevie decides to hang his boots up, Can will be the ideal replacement if he continues to improve as a player. He is a very bright prospect.</p> <p>Dejan Lovren will also improve the Liverpool defence, although the criticism of them was too harsh last season. They have moved to strengthen the full-back positions and are better defensively than people make out.</p> <p>However, with the added demands of the Champions League, I am not sure if Liverpool can win the league. Manchester City are my favourites and the signing of Eliaquim Mangala will improve them defensively, even though Mart\xc3\xadn Demichelis formed a good partnership with Vincent Kompany at the end of last season. The signing of Fernando will also make the team more balanced. They will not go anywhere in the Champions League with a midfield pairing of Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 and Fernandinho but Fernando will be crucial in shielding the defence.</p> <p>Their reinforcements have not been eye-catching and I was perplexed by the signing of Frank Lampard, but they still have the best squad. Do not forget that they won the league with \xc3\x81lvaro Negredo and Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero barely doing anything in the run-in. Having them fit is a bonus and Stevan Jovetic looked like a different player in pre-season.</p> <p>City are a better team than Chelsea. I do not understand why people think the west London club are title favourites. Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has been on edge since his return. Bringing Didier Drogba back was a strange decision and moves like that often end in tears. They should have kept Samuel Eto&apos;o for another season and I do not see Diego Costa offering them much. Should they have sold Romelu Lukaku? Everton will not be far off the top four with him up front and if you compare how much Manchester United paid for Luke Shaw, they got him for a reasonable price at \xc2\xa328m.</p> <p>Costa is overrated. He had a couple of good years for Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid, but his biggest asset is his physicality and while he could bully defenders in Spain, in England they will not be scared of him; as we saw at the World Cup, he is not a ball-playing striker. He was badly found out for Spain.</p> <p>Chelsea play in a different way and maybe he will be a better fit for them but Roman Abramovich has won everything and wants to see a more expansive style. Cesc F\xc3\xa1bregas is obviously a very good signing. I played against him a few times and he is gifted. But is he dominant enough to change Chelsea&apos;s style? Can he do that on his own? Has he got the players around him to bring out the best in him? I am not so sure.</p> <p>Arsenal look like the best London team and have done well in the transfer window. Maybe they need another midfielder, but Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez is a very good buy. He is a decisive player and, unlike Olivier Giroud, I expect him to make a difference in those big matches. If I have one concern, it is whether they have goalkeepers who can win them the league. It is not clear if David Ospina is the real deal.</p> <p>However, the best signing this summer is not a player, but a manager: Louis van Gaal. He is precisely what Manchester United needed. He is the perfect fit, a strong hand who has shown with his comments about Shaw&apos;s lack of fitness that he does not care who he upsets. Van Gaal has his way. Either he brings out the best of Wayne Rooney or he eventually gets rid of him \xe2\x80\x93 there will be no in between. The good news for United is that Rooney, the new captain, is buying into Van Gaal&apos;s approach.</p> <p>They still need some more experience in defence and the worry is in midfield. Ander Herrera will improve them but they need one or two more. Then it is a case of how Van Gaal fits Rooney, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata into the side. If he finds the right formation, United will be serious contenders.</p> <p>Forget about Chelsea, I have a feeling that Van Gaal&apos;s United will be the biggest threat to City.</p>'
