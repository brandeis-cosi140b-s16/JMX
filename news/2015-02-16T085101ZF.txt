b'FA Cup fifth round: talking points from the weekend action | Guardian writers'


b'1) Home comforts provide succour for Arsenal <p>A sequence of nine consecutive wins, manufactured by scoring 23 goals and conceding three, have turned the Emirates into a source of home comfort for Arsenal. They continued their confident run by swatting aside the challenge from up-and-coming Middlesbrough in the FA Cup and Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger sees that as an important foundation for the challenges ahead. For all the value of the cup runs, Wenger quickly turned his attention to the Premier League not long after the final whistle secured his team\xe2\x80\x99s progress to the FA Cup sixth round. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have plenty of home games. We have some tough opponents here, it\xe2\x80\x99s important we feel strong at home. Liverpool, Everton, Chelsea will be very important games for us.\xe2\x80\x9d Monaco are visiting the Emirates in the Champions League next week and Wenger has his eye on another home win as a springboard for the rest of the campaign.

The Belgium international has scored only three times in 19 appearances for Villa this season and Sherwood will have seen with his own eyes on Sunday, in the 2-1 win over Leicester City, just how much the striker is struggling for form. It was not only the wayward shot that Benteke blazed over when he ran clear in the second half; his general game, whether holding the ball up or picking the right pass, smacked of a player desperately lacking confidence. Benteke, on his day, is unplayable, as he demonstrated on a regular basis in the second half of his first season at the club. If Sherwood can rebuild Benteke\xe2\x80\x99s belief, in the same way that he brought the best out of Emmanuel Adebayor at Tottenham Hotspur last season, and also set the team up to play to the striker\xe2\x80\x99s strengths, Villa\xe2\x80\x99s chances of staying up will be hugely improved. Stuart James</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Aston Villa 2-1 Leicester City\xe2\x80\xa2 Sherwood praised for his \xe2\x80\x98positive impact on dressing room\xe2\x80\xa2 Michael Cox: Sherwood\xe2\x80\x99s changes reap reward\xe2\x80\xa2 Tim Sherwood makes instant impact\xe2\x80\xa2 Gregg Bakowski\xe2\x80\x99s minute-by-minute report</p>  3) Poyet needs to build, not burn his bridges <p>All is not well on Wearside right now and one did not have to be present for Gus Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s bizarre Seagull and Trawler moment in the post-match press conference to realise it. Asked about the jeers from the 4,250-strong travelling support during the 2-0 FA Cup defeat at Bradford, Poyet responded: \xe2\x80\x9cI am not going to get involved any more. I am doing my job, I know what\xe2\x80\x99s good for the team, the players give everything. If we close Sunderland and put a china wall around the city it will be fantastic.\xe2\x80\x9d The inference being that it is the media to blame for the chants of \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s always our fault\xe2\x80\x9d emanating from the away end at Valley Parade, presumably in response to last month\xe2\x80\x99s difference of opinion between dugout and terraces on the team\xe2\x80\x99s style of play. Further disquiet followed the home defeat by QPR last week. With only a two-point buffer to the relegation zone heading into the final 13 Premier League matches it is not an ideal time for friction with anyone. Richard Gibson</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Bradford 2-0 Sunderland\xe2\x80\xa2 Parkinson looks forward to televised game in last eight</p>  4) Derby heroic in defeat <p>There is a growing clamour from managers \xe2\x80\x93 mainly, but not exclusively, Premier League managers \xe2\x80\x93 for FA Cup replays to be scrapped. Such is the pressure of league fixtures, they argue, all Cup ties should be a one-off and conclude with penalties if the sides cannot be separated after extra-time. </p> <p>Leaving aside questions of fairness and match revenue, however, there is now a strong case to be made that the determination of some clubs to avoid having to play an extra match is producing some of the best games of the season. It is hard to believe, for example, there was a more entertaining match than that at the iPro Stadium, where the number of chances created by both sides added up to well over 30. Despite going down to 10 men after 39 minutes, Steve McClaren\xe2\x80\x99s Derby County side attacked without pause and, though it hardly seemed possible, stepped up their efforts after equalising, when under normal circumstances they would have sat back and settled for taking Reading back to the Madejski. </p> <p>The speed of the game as play switched from end to end was extraordinary, and served to highlight the touch, skill and athleticism of the players. For most of the second half Derby played a 2-5-2 formation, which demanded the midfield in particular cover a huge amount of ground and, while the media are quick to criticise and highlight individual mistakes and errors, at the end of this game it was only possible to shake one\xe2\x80\x99s head and applaud. \xe2\x80\x9cHeroic\xe2\x80\x9d was McClaren\xe2\x80\x99s description, and for once, the word did not seem entirely inappropriate.

The goalkeeper had already made critical saves against Everton and Tottenham Hotspur to suggest that he has come back from his exclusion from the team as a better goalkeeper but he needed another encouraging display against Palace \xe2\x80\x93 both because he, even more than most Liverpool players, had particularly bad memories of Selhurst Park and because he had previewed the game by explaining publicly how he regained his form. </p> <p>He backed that up with a performance that showed he has become more decisive. There was none of the hesitancy and instability that spread jitters among Liverpool fans and defenders earlier this season. Instead he dealt well with crosses and set pieces, constantly punching the ball away from danger, and he was always quick off his line, notably narrowing the angle on Dwight Gayle before making a superb save with his feet to prevent Palace from taking a 2-0 lead; Alan Pardew later identified that as the game\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpivotal moment\xe2\x80\x9d. Even his kicking was decent and on one occasion, when it seemed as if Fraizer Campbell was about to charge down an attempted clearance, he feinted his way past the striker and booted the ball to Alberto Moreno despite slipping. </p> <p>With Mario Balotelli also suggesting he is finding form, what is needed now is a series of solid performances from Dejan Lovren, allowing Emre Can to push into midfield, and Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s impressive mid-season transformation will be almost complete. All that will remain will be for them to crown that with a top-four finish and a trophy. Their chances of doing that look good: they have indicated an ability to think clearly when facing failure; now Brendan Rodgers and his players must show they can keep clinical when triumph beckons.

Palace played some excellent football under Pulis and West Brom are beginning to do the same. He keeps things simple, staying tight at the back and breaking out quickly when possible, but there is nothing wrong with that. </p> <p>Some Baggies fans on message boards were describing the victory over West Ham as their best display for decades, which was perhaps a little over the top but a long way from moaning that Pulis had brought along his bullying tactics from Stoke. Pulis seems to specialise in organisation and communication, can make a difference remarkably quickly and is deservedly building a reputation for bringing the best from any given group of players. Louis van Gaal has been at Manchester United for more than half a season now and has just admitted he is not sure of his best team or his best system, probably because he has such an embarrassment of playing riches. That will probably never happen to Pulis, who tends to operate at the more cost-conscious end of the spectrum, though the Theatre of Dreams might have heard fewer snores this season had United gone Welsh instead of Dutch.

The previous reverse had been on 22 December when Chelsea won 2-0 in the Potteries. Yet by Saturday evening the Welshman had overseen a second 4-1 defeat in four days, as Blackburn Rovers knocked Stoke out of the FA Cup at the fifth-round stage at Ewood Park. Now, the club stand 10th in the Premier League with only 13 games left of their season and Hughes is determined they will not fall away.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re absolutely determined not to allow that to happen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve had a good season up to this point, two games won\xe2\x80\x99t change that. We\xe2\x80\x99ll pick ourselves up, we obviously have to dust ourselves down. It\xe2\x80\x99s been a week that\xe2\x80\x99s been difficult. It started OK, we had a great result at Newcastle [drawing 1-1], getting a last-gasp goal, which was a real boost for us, but the last two games have knocked the stuffing out of us somewhat. But we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a week now, we can pick ourselves up and we\xe2\x80\x99ll go again. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>What Hughes may tell his troops is to recall the first 45 minutes against City when they made the champions wobble, and to forget everything since. If so, Stoke have a chance of catching West Ham United, who are five points ahead, to finish in a fine sixth place.
