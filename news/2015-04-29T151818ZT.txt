b'WALCOTT, DON\xe2\x80\x99T YOU KNOW THAT IT\xe2\x80\x99S INSANE? <p>Bibliophiles, the only people likely to know what the hell that word means, are all in a tizzy about the imminent publication of recently discovered works by the famous story-hogger JD Salinger. So we have to wonder whether the literary world can possibly cope with the excitement that is sure to follow today\xe2\x80\x99s revelations that another elusive author is about to release a new masterpiece. It has been four long years since Theo Walcott treated us to the last of his quartet of books starring TJ, a happy-go-lucky football prodigy who is loved by everyone except mean teachers, ghastly bullies and, perhaps, Tottenham fans. But the wait is over!</p> <p>After TJ and the Cup Run, TJ and the Winning Goal, TJ and the Hat-trick and TJ and the Penalty, Walcott is at last ready to unleash the natural next instalment in his series: TJ and the Odd Delusion. Showcasing an imagination so fertile that it could sprout a whole rainforest of fantastical scenarios, Walcott today outlined the fictional universe he has created for his latest story, a wacky one in which every team in Europe aspires to be just like Arsenal!</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn this calendar year, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been the best team in Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Walcott of a storyline steeped in magical realism, featuring dragons, talkative greyhounds and no mention whatsoever of humiliations at home to Monaco. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the strongest the squad has been and everyone is staying fit as well,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Walcott, avoiding a spoiler by declining to disclose whether the squad is so fit that TJ can no longer get a start for his team and winds up being flogged to Liverpool, where he is taken under the wing of a seancha\xc3\xad with an inexhaustible supply of far-fetched yarns. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we had an injury-free season, I think we could lift the title,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Walcott, without saying which title he was planning to lift. Surely TJ and the World in Which the Likes of Barcelona, Bayern and Chelsea Don\xe2\x80\x99t Exist has not already been taken, has it?</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE <p>Paul Doyle is in the house for MBM coverage of Leicester 1-1 Chelsea in the Premier League at 7.45pm BST, while Daniel Harris will be watching Real Madrid 4-0 Almeria in la Liga from 7pm.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY     Rotherham manager Steve Evans in one of his more reflective moods. Photograph: Paul Currie/Action Images    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cA Millwall player said we\xe2\x80\x99ve not got bottle. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got 12 bottles of pink finest Champagne and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be drinking them for about a week. Look forward to League One, son, and keep your trap shut\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 the ever-classy Rotherham manager Steve Evans takes a swipe at Lee Gregory, after the Millwall player expressed his hope that the Millers would bottle their survival scrap. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: Stephen Hernandez letter about \xe2\x80\x98Bagsy\xe2\x80\x99 (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters). You can\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x98Bagsy no more letters about bagsy\xe2\x80\x99. You can Bagsy to reserve things for yourself, call shotgun to bagsy the front seat (or any seat you prefer) or have dibs on something. Maybe you can have dibs on shotgun?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Steve Stebbings</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cContinuing the Daniel Sturridge-shaped hole theme, regardless of it it\xe2\x80\x99s a bed or a couch or whatever, if it\xe2\x80\x99s a Daniel Sturridge-shaped hole and you put Daniel Sturridge on top of it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he just fall straight though it much in the same way as a toddler\xe2\x80\x99s shape recognition toy? If so, I guess this would explain why he is always injured\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Andy Yates.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI find it hard to believe that Charlie Austin is annoyed by having to wait another week for his bins to be emptied. He\xe2\x80\x99s been surrounded by rubbish all season, so what\xe2\x80\x99s another week?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Stephen Yoxall.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI see that palaeontologists are at a loss as to how to fit bizarre new discovery Chilesaurus diegosuarezi into the dinosaur family tree, what with it being a therapod turned vegetarian. Might I suggest the mystery will remain unsolved until such time as fossil remains of its emphatically carnivorous cousin Uruguaysaurus luissuarezi come to light\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Dermot McDermott</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
