b'Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas missing for Spain but should be fit for Chelsea'


b'<p>Chelsea are confident Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas will be fit to start their next Premier League game, against West Bromwich Albion, despite the midfielder withdrawing from the Spain squad citing discomfort in his hamstring.</p> <p>F\xc3\xa0bregas was called up by Vicente del Bosque for Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s Euro 2016 qualifier against Belarus in Huelva and next Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s friendly against Germany in Vigo but indicated he had an injury. The Spanish football federation\xe2\x80\x99s medical staff examined the 27-year-old in Madrid and, while there did not seem to be a serious problem, agreed to release the player back to Chelsea for treatment.</p> <p>The midfielder had played the whole of Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League victory at Liverpool on Saturday, having also featured for 90 minutes in the midweek Champions League draw in Maribor, though Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho had indicated that including F\xc3\xa0bregas had represented a \xe2\x80\x9cgamble\xe2\x80\x9d given he was carrying the injury.</p> <p>Del Bosque said on Wednesday the player\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmuscle seems all right, but he complains and he is the best doctor\xe2\x80\x9d and that, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a player of his calibre tells you that he is injured, you have to believe him\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Chelsea have since conducted their own checks on their \xc2\xa330m signing from Barcelona, whose return to English football has been so eye-catching to date, and are confident rest during the international window will suffice to ensure he can face West Brom on 22 November. The same applies to Diego Costa, who was not selected by Spain given recent groin and hamstring trouble.</p>'
