b'Cesc F\xc3\xa1bregas is making the difference for Chelsea \xe2\x80\x93 Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho'


b'<p>Forget Frank Lampard. Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho may not have been expecting the former Chelsea stalwart to pitch up at Manchester City after leaving Stamford Bridge in the summer but the outcome of Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s match between the two favourites for the Premier League title is likely to depend more on a signing that raised Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s eyebrows even higher \xe2\x80\x93 Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI thought he was going to stay at Barcelona,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mourinho, who is grateful but somewhat mystified that F\xc3\xa0bregas was available at a time when natural erosion seemed to be weakening the Catalans\xe2\x80\x99 midfield. \xe2\x80\x9cI was looking at him as the natural successor of this generation of Barcelona players who were getting older, like Xavi. The surprise for me was not that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to Arsenal but that he was actually leaving Barcelona.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Under the terms of the transfer that had taken F\xc3\xa0bregas from London to the Camp Nou in 2011, Arsenal had the right of first refusal if Barcelona ever decided to sell the player, but Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger decided against a reunion with his former captain. So the path was clear for Chelsea to pick up a proven elite midfielder for a fraction more than the \xc2\xa325m that Liverpool paid Southampton for Adam Lallana \xe2\x80\x93 a bit puzzling but a no-brainer for Chelsea.</p> <p>F\xc3\xa0bregas has got into the groove immediately, helping Chelsea to swagger through their first four league matches. He has woven his team together and contributed an assist in each of those games, showing an instant understanding not only with the club\xe2\x80\x99s other major recruit, the striker Diego Costa, but with all of his new team-mates. There is no surprise there. F\xc3\xa0bregas is a supremely intelligent player with an innate ability to spot a killer pass, as exemplified by his brilliant set-up for Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle in Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s win at Burnley in their opening match of the season.</p> <p>It was seven years ago that Wenger said F\xc3\xa0bregas had qualities akin to one of the finest playmakers of all time \xe2\x80\x93 Michel Platini. F\xc3\xa0bregas has evolved impressively since then and Mourinho reckons he has returned to the Premier League at his prime. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s 27 years old, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s the perfect age,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9c[He is] physically on a high, mentally very stable, [and has a] tactical education in different contexts.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Gary Neville said on Sky this week that F\xc3\xa0bregas\xe2\x80\x99s one flaw is a tendency to go chasing the ball at the expense of team shape, meaning that, while he is an outstanding offensive midfielder, he makes teams vulnerable when he is one of only two central midfielders. Mourinho disagrees. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the reasons he\xe2\x80\x99s so important for us is exactly because he can play in any position,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cEven in Barcelona he was playing so many times as a nine \xe2\x80\x93 their style of nine. He sometimes was playing on the left wing too. He can play in many positions. It depends what you want. What is your plan? Where do you think he can be or have more influence on the game?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>So what will be Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s plan at City? Neville said F\xc3\xa0bregas is likely to be deployed as part of a three-man central midfield, perhaps with Ramires and Nemanja Matic performing the bulk of break-up work, as they did in the second-half of the win over Swansea after Mourinho withdrew Sch\xc3\xbcrrle.</p> <p>Manuel Pellegrini must be pondering a similar issue, and it will likely seem more pressing to him given how flimsy the normally dominant Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 has been so far this season. If F\xc3\xa0bregas sometimes leaves Chelsea vulnerable, then Tour\xc3\xa9 has been a liability to City on occasions this season, notably in the midweek Champions League defeat by Bayern Munich. The notion that City should go into their most important contests of the season so far without their best player from last term might seem perverse but Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s meagre contributions in the early days of this campaign mean the manager must be seriously considering it, especially given how comprehensively Matic subdued Tour\xc3\xa9 in this fixture last season, which the Ivorian had gone into in fine form.</p> <p>If Tour\xc3\xa9 does start \xe2\x80\x93 and it would certainly be understandable if Pellegrini elected to keep faith with a player of such enormous quality - it will likely be in an advanced role in front of two central midfielders and at the cost of either dropping David Silva or shifting the Spaniard farther wide. The result of the match could come down to who manages to exert more influence: will it be Tour\xc3\xa9, the best midfielder in last season\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League, or F\xc3\xa0bregas, the man most likely to take his crown?</p>'
