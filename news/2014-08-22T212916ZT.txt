b'Tim Howard has his Everton and international future all planned out | Andy Hunter'


b'<p>It should not be difficult prising an uplifting World Cup tale from Tim Howard. After all, this is the man who set a record of 15 saves against Belgium, was thanked by Barack Obama, replaced Chuck Hagel as the US secretary of defence on Wikipedia as his internet profile went viral and has guest-starred on comedian Jason Sudeikis\xe2\x80\x99s latest episode of Ted Lasso, the hapless US soccer coach fired after six and a half hours by Tottenham. So what are Howard\xe2\x80\x99s abiding memories of Brazil? Losing and trying to pee in the company of the man responsible for his World Cup misery.</p> <p>The Everton goalkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s reflections on the World Cup serve as a jolt and a reminder that, for a professional sportsperson, acclaim, financial reward and even recognition from the president of the United States are secondary to the need to win. J\xc3\xbcrgen Klinsmann\xe2\x80\x99s USA team enthralled in progressing from a group containing Germany, the eventual world champions, Ghana and Portugal.</p> <p>They left the watching world breathless with that epic last-16 tie against Belgium. But they lost. For their 35-year-old goalkeeper, who he is taking a 12-month break from international football and plans to quit football when his Everton contract expires in 2018, that is the bottom line.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn 2010 we lost in the round of 16 and in 2014 we lost in the round of 16,\xe2\x80\x9d Howard says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were poo-pooed in 2010 and we\xe2\x80\x99re celebrated now, but we still lost in the round of 16 so it\xe2\x80\x99s all a little bit lost on me. I played well on the day, we were resilient against a real tough Belgium team. But I\xe2\x80\x99m an old dog. I don\xe2\x80\x99t get too excited. We lost a game of football when although we played a good team, we could have won at the end.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Howard\xe2\x80\x99s defiance against Belgium was broken in extra-time by Kevin De Bruyne and Romelu Lukaku. Despite Julian Green\xe2\x80\x99s response and several late chances there was no reprieve for the US and Howard\xe2\x80\x99s night deteriorated when selected for a post-match doping test. Not easy after sweating for 120 minutes in Salvador, nor when the Belgium player chosen turned out to be Lukaku \xe2\x80\x93 the match-winner who turned his Everton loan spell from Chelsea into a permanent stay for \xc2\xa328m after the World Cup.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was happy for him as a person because I regard the guys at Everton as like my family. I love those guys,\xe2\x80\x9d Howard says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was heartbreaking to lose but I was oddly happy for him because I believe in him and love him as a person. He is not arrogant, he is a good person.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe were just standing there trying to drink water. Your mind is racing. He is looking forward at a World Cup and I am looking back. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk about the game. We talked about our families and we spoke a little bit about what was next for him. He said he\xe2\x80\x99d had some good conversations with Roberto [Mart\xc3\xadnez, the Everton manager] so I was encouraged by that.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to beat him over the head about joining Everton. We made our case last year. Maybe he had to keep things in check. I wanted to go cry in the locker room and he wanted to celebrate. As much as I felt his joy, he felt my pain. Eventually we both peed and we left.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The following day Howard and his captain, Clint Dempsey, were summoned to a room at the team hotel for a call from Obama, who credited their performances with \xe2\x80\x9cfocusing\xe2\x80\x9d the US on the sport. \xe2\x80\x9cWe spoke to him via a speakerphone. It all had to be checked out by secret service first and through the White House,\xe2\x80\x9d Howard says. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m fortunate because 99.9% of people don\xe2\x80\x99t get to speak to him. You just try not to say anything stupid really, just \xe2\x80\x98yes sir, no sir\xe2\x80\x99. He watched the game with his family and said he was on the edge of his seat. It was cool that he was so excited about it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Obama admitted \xe2\x80\x9csoccer\xe2\x80\x9d was his first sport growing up in Hawaii and knew exactly what lay in store for Howard. The president advised the goalkeeper to shave his beard \xe2\x80\x93 he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x93 in an attempt to avoid crowds and cautioned: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you are going to survive the mobs, man.\xe2\x80\x9d The attention, you suspect, has been the downside of the World Cup for Howard, who admits the anonymity he enjoyed back at home in North Brunswick, New Jersey, has faded since his exploits in Brazil.</p> <p>He says: \xe2\x80\x9cIt has gone a little bit. It\xe2\x80\x99s down to the internet, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived in Manchester for 12 years. Football in England is a fish bowl and you have to deal with it. I\xe2\x80\x99m very comfortable with it. I can compartmentalise things. I have my own little bubble and I don\xe2\x80\x99t really get carried away with all of it.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no privacy in our culture any more so I have to try and carve that out for myself, but I\xe2\x80\x99m OK with it. I\xe2\x80\x99ll sign autographs but not when I\xe2\x80\x99m out for a meal or out with my kids. That\xe2\x80\x99s rude and disrespectful. I would never ask anyone for an autograph while they were eating dinner. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I was taught by my parents.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Howard may be comfortable with World Cup fame but will be relieved to return to the sanctuary of a competitive game at Goodison Park against Arsenal on Saturday . \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be good to get home,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt feels like I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been there forever.\xe2\x80\x9d He described April\xe2\x80\x99s 3-0 defeat of Arsenal as \xe2\x80\x9cone of the signature performances since I have been at Everton\xe2\x80\x9d and is intrigued to discover whether that display, when Lukaku was switched to the right by Mart\xc3\xadnez to exploit Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s weakness at left-back, will have a lingering effect.</p> <p>He says: \xe2\x80\x9cWe switched things up on them last season and we really hurt them. Will they be coming to defend against that or will they be trying to play straight up? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. We had a system and a style that worked last year and we need to grow from that.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cGetting Rom was a huge thing for us, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the money can be down-played, and our ambition is to finisher higher than last year. Other clubs have been spending ridiculously for the past 10 years and we have still managed to find a way. Now we are doing it with style and with better players, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why not.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Everton\xe2\x80\x99s No1 for the past nine years announced he was taking a break from the national team on Thursday but is adamant it is not a retirement. Howard has not ruled out one more World Cup campaign but accepts there is no guarantee of a recall. What is certain, he insists, is that 2018 will be his final year as a professional. The four-year contract extension he signed with Everton in April will be the American\xe2\x80\x99s last.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPrior to 2010 it was simple,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I will play for four years and go to the World Cup and then I will go again and play in a World Cup. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s harder. I\xe2\x80\x99m getting older. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be 39 at the next World Cup.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy contract here will have just finished and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be done with football at the end of that. It would be perfect timing. There are other things I want to do. I want to do lots of things in my local community back home, get out of the public eye for a while and just be normal. Football has been great for me and to finish up at Everton after 13 years and then maybe have another World Cup would be great.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf I stay free from injury and keep myself fit, and the mental challenge for me has never been an issue, then I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why I can\xe2\x80\x99t be in the mix and be considered. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s as No1 or the No2 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I will have to compete for that, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why not if the circumstances are right.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Everton supporters\xe2\x80\x99 groups in the US held a Tim Howard Appreciation Day last Saturday, with more than 50 pubs involved. That is one by-product of Brazil that has Howard\xe2\x80\x99s support. \xe2\x80\x9cA friend sent me an image of a flyer that was on the internet. Free beer for everyone, that\xe2\x80\x99s cool,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cYou get 15 minutes of fame, I hear, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve had 14 minutes. The clock\xe2\x80\x99s ticking.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
