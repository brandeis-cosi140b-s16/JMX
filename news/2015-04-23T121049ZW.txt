b'What now for Theo Walcott? Nine years at Arsenal and still not a certain starter | Paul Chronnell'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho will remember it well. The 2007 Carling Cup final in Cardiff was only 12 minutes old when Abou Diaby slipped a pass across the edge of the penalty area and a whippet-fast teenager controlled it, nipped through a gap and finished adroitly past Petr Cech.</p> <p>That player was Theo Walcott, it was his first goal for Arsenal and, although Mourinho and Chelsea would end up victorious, the promise of a boy still a few weeks short of his 18th birthday seemed undoubted. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger looked to have a brilliant young talent in his ranks.</p> <p>Over eight years on from that game, Mourinho will take his Chelsea side to the Emirates to meet Arsenal on Sunday. In the intervening years Mourinho has left Chelsea, managed and won league titles in Milan and Madrid, returned to Stamford Bridge and is on the verge of more glory. It is unlikely Walcott will start the game. More than nine years since signing for Arsenal as a startled 16-year-old in January 2006, Walcott does not seem to be the finished article.</p> <p>If the Southampton prodigy was blinded by the media glare when he was unveiled that day, it was merely a preparation for his even more surprising inclusion, four months later, by Sven-Goran Eriksson in England\xe2\x80\x99s squad for the 2006 World Cup finals in Germany, despite Walcott not having played a single minute for Arsenal or in the top flight.</p> <p>It is only one of the ironies of Walcott\xe2\x80\x99s stop-start career that he has not made it to a World Cup since to reap the benefit of that experience, having been dropped by Fabio Capello in 2010 and then missing out injured last year.</p> <p>It is perhaps another irony that Walcott, along with the permanently injured Diaby, who joined the club a week before him, are the longest-serving members of Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s squad. At 26 Walcott should be approaching his peak but remains a player who divides opinion among fans and pundits alike.</p>     Walcott poses with the Arsenal manager, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger, after signing for the club as a 16-year-old in 2006.

One moment he is burying a half-chance with undoubted finesse, the next he is back on the periphery, drifting through games, showing neither the required wit or aggression to combat the best defences in the Premier League and Europe. Discussions over a new contract have become a thorny issue for a player whose current deal expires in little over 12 months\xe2\x80\x99 time.</p> <p>Walcott and Arsenal have been here before \xe2\x80\x93 in 2013 his contract was within six months of finishing when he signed a new three-and-a-half year deal worth a reported \xc2\xa3100,000 a week. Perhaps the signs of doubt from player and club were there then, some telling reticence to over-commit: the club\xe2\x80\x99s customary five-year deal rule for a young player had not been adhered to and, modern contract negotiations being what they are, Arsenal must have known they would be back down this road soon enough.</p> <p>Two years later and they are. Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of the issue this time has been interesting, making a none too subtle dig at the player\xe2\x80\x99s advisers last month. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is very quick on the pitch but off the pitch not always,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wenger. Walcott then took to Twitter to say, quite pointedly, that no discussions had yet taken place.</p> <p>So how badly do Arsenal want to keep him or, to be more pertinent, how much do they need him? Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s 4-2-3-1 formation should suit the pace Walcott offers on the right flank but has ended up frustrating him. He has made no secret of his desire to play up front but as the lone striker he simply does not have the attributes, the ability to lead the line or the physical presence of Olivier Giroud or Danny Welbeck. Walcott inherited Thierry Henry\xe2\x80\x99s No14 shirt and it was often felt he would follow the Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps in evolving from a wide player to a central striker too but that day still looks a long way off.</p> <p>The arrival of Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez and Welbeck last summer to complement Mesut \xc3\x96zil, Santi Cazorla and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has merely intensified the competition for the wide roles at the Emirates. S\xc3\xa1nchez has raised the bar of what is expected from Arsenal forward players, Giroud and even the slow-burning \xc3\x96zil have lately responded in kind. The defensive of industry of S\xc3\xa1nchez, Welbeck and Oxlade-Chamberlain has also not gone unnoticed; it is an area where Walcott has often been found wanting.</p>     Walcott scored his first goal for Arsenal in the 2007 Carling Cup final defeat by Chelsea. Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images    <p>The 2012-13 season had looked like it was to be his breakthrough year. With Robin van Persie having left for Manchester United, there was more of a goalscoring burden on others and Walcott responded, scoring 21 goals in all competitions. On the back of a goal at Euro 2012 for Roy Hodgson\xe2\x80\x99s new-look England, Walcott, at 23, appeared to have arrived. Much like his lethal hat-trick for England in Croatia in 2008, however, it proved another false dawn, another moment when fleeting potential has not quite transformed into the consistent performer he craves to be.</p> <p>Injuries have, of course, played their part. Persistent shoulder problems interrupted his early years at the club, and it took him until 2011-12 to have an entirely injury-free campaign. Theruptured anterior cruciate ligament that ended his season and World Cup hopes in January last year was an untimely blow, stunting tangible progress.</p> <p>For his part, Wenger has been forthright he wants Walcott to stay. He has invested much time, and the club much money, into the player\xe2\x80\x99s career and the prospect of his best years being spent elsewhere is not one the manager wants to entertain. He has seen that too often before. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is only young and I believe he will have a great goalscoring record in the future because of the quality and intelligence of his game. Therefore I want him to stay with our club,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wenger last week.</p> <p>That goal against Chelsea at the Millennium Stadium certainly feels a long time ago. Sunday would be a good time for Walcott to remind everyone of his attributes, maybe a few suitors as well as his own club.</p>'
