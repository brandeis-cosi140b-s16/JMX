b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini has Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic all injured for this visit of Crystal Palace meaning the champions of England have no frontline striker available. The manager may field Jos\xc3\xa9 \xc3\x81ngel Pozo in attack for a consecutive start as he is a forward by trade, or perhaps turn to James Milner, Samir Nasri or David Silva to knit the side together when moving forward. Pellegrini, though, can be delighted at being only three points behind Chelsea following their early season travails yet Neil Warnock\xe2\x80\x99s Palace may prove awkward opposition.
