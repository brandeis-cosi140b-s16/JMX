b'Has Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho landed transfer bargain of the season with Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my? | Paul Doyle'


b'<p>When Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my swept in another delicious goal on Thursday night, combining with Mathieu Valbuena as the duo used to do at Marseille, he not only gave France victory in their prestigious friendly with Spain in Paris, he also upstaged Diego Costa, who again struggled to blend into the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 system before being replaced shortly after his new club-mate\xe2\x80\x99s successful strike. Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho must have been delighted. Other top managers must be worried.</p> <p>R\xc3\xa9my scoring when Costa does not is exactly what Chelsea want to see happen regularly this season. It could be the key to them winning the Premier League and even the Champions League. Costa has made a brilliant beginning to his career in England but will not always be on form or in the team, and when he is off-colour or rested, R\xc3\xa9my will be expected to step up and help provide the goals that Chelsea lacked last term.</p> <p>That is a reasonable expectation given the Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s ability and recent record, notably his 14 goals in 26 appearances for Newcastle while on loan last season.</p> <p>R\xc3\xa9my has not always been the most reliable performer, partially because of unfortunate injuries, but since moving from Marseille to the Premier League in 2013 he has improved on the two aspects of his game that had been the most lamented in France \xe2\x80\x93 his consistency and his physicality \xe2\x80\x93 and now he boasts a rare skill set that also includes exceptional speed, canny movement, tricky feet and exquisite finishing. Signing the 27-year-old this summer seemed a no-brainer for any big club given the relatively paltry \xc2\xa38.5m buy-out clause in his QPR contract, yet the queue of suitors was puzzlingly short. So as soon as Milan relieved them of Fernando Torres, Chelsea were able to pop over to Loftus Road and help themselves to a ready-made upgrade. Will other clubs end up regretting that?</p> <p>Brendan Rodgers, of course, did recognise how valuable R\xc3\xa9my could be and was about to bring him to Anfield earlier in the summer before backtracking. It is believed that Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s medical staff detected the same heart problem that their Marseille counterparts had spotted four years previously, although the French club did not deem it serious enough to prevent them buying R\xc3\xa9my from Nice for some \xc2\xa38m, and QPR, Newcastle and Chelsea do not appear to have found anything too alarming since then.</p> <p>Harry Redknapp was baffled by Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s about-turn, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cHe had a stringent medical here \xe2\x80\x93 one at Marseilles, at Newcastle and with the French team at the World Cup \xe2\x80\xa6 he\xe2\x80\x99s got no problems whatsoever.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Perhaps, however, other clubs were still scared off by the breakdown in the Liverpool transfer. There is no other obvious explanation for the apparent reluctance to pursue R\xc3\xa9my, whose talent would improve any squad in the Premier League and many other elite clubs in Europe.</p> <p>Arsenal were the club most often linked with the Frenchman and could have had him for almost half the price that they ended up paying Manchester United for Danny Welbeck, who could well turn out to be a tremendous acquisition for the club but is not yet, and may never be, a finisher in R\xc3\xa9my\xe2\x80\x99s class. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger could probably have landed his compatriot in the summer long before Olivier Giroud\xe2\x80\x99s injury led Arsenal to turn their attention to the striker at the same time as Chelsea. R\xc3\xa9my had certainly not played hard to get, even turning up at the Emiratesin May to watch Arsenal in action against West Bromwich Albion.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI hope he paid for his ticket,\xe2\x80\x9d said the laughing Arsenal manager, who, later that night, possibly had a recurrence of that dream of his where Yaya Sanogo skips through a high-grade defence and curls the ball into the top corner of the goal to complete another hat-trick.</p> <p>Talented, determined young players should not be dismissed lightly, of course, and R\xc3\xa9my\xe2\x80\x99s progression in recent years could be cited as evidence that Welbeck and even Sanogo could develop into outstanding strikers. Yet one of the defining themes of this season, despite Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s purchase of Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez, will be the contrast between Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s continued faith in unripened fruit and Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s rigorous impatience. Romelu Lukaku would surely still be an Arsenal player if he had joined that London club rather than Chelsea years ago, but Mourinho let the Belgian leave Chelsea because he prefers proven reliability to bright potential. R\xc3\xa9my offers that and Chelsea fans must be confident that Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s approach will be vindicated.</p>'
