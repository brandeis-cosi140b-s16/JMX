b'Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Manuel Pellegrini switches focus after Middlesbrough defeat'


b'<p>So, Manuel Pellegrini, is it true that Manchester City disrespected the FA Cup and seriously underestimated Middlesbrough\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities by taking a warm weather break in Abu Dhabi and only returning the evening before the game?</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I understand why people might think that, but I have a different opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were ready for this game and in the first half we made a lot of clear chances to go in front. We just didn\xe2\x80\x99t take them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Fair enough. Let\xe2\x80\x99s put the question slightly differently. Would you consider doing the same thing this week, only returning from a sunshine break on the evening before your now crucial visit to Chelsea on Saturday?</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut this was not the game against Chelsea. We must now finish thinking about the FA Cup and turn our full focus to the Premier League.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Make of that what you will, but it is clear that FA Cup upsets are not what they used to be. Middlesbrough were full value for a sensational result at the Etihad, fully deserving of victory and a little unlucky not to have won by an even more emphatic margin, but intentionally or otherwise City clearly signalled that their priorities lay elsewhere. As did Chelsea, by making nine changes against Bradford. Sometimes big clubs can get away with taking such liberties, sometimes they are going to be caught out. City were caught out by a bold and enterprising Boro, for whom Patrick Bamford and Lee Tomlin were irrepressible in attack, but sadly the shock factor was missing.</p> <p>The home side were asking for trouble, Boro are flying high in the Championship after all, and even Pellegrini admitted the required level of concentration and application was not there. Someone had better break this gently to the BBC, and anyone else still harping on about the magic of the FA Cup, but unless there is a return to the time when every club wanted to win the trophy more than just about anything else in the world, \xe2\x80\x93 a state of affairs that younger readers might be amazed to learn existed as recently as two or three decades ago \xe2\x80\x93 going out of the competition will no longer feel like the end of the world.</p> <p>City are now free to concentrate on what could be a title decider at Stamford Bridge, and after that the knockout stages of the Champions League, and Pellegrini did not sound like a man worried about explaining to his superiors that there would be no running round Wembley with the cup this year. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a difficult game against the leaders to prepare for, and I hope that during the week we can recover our normal level of performance,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am concerned about the number of goals we are conceding as well as the fact that we have not scored in our last two home games. We need to improve in defence and attack.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini also highlighted the fact that it was a game of contrasting halves, with City on top in the first and Boro running away with the second, and had the home side managed a goal or two when they were dominant their opponents might have accepted their fate and conserved their energy for their promotion push. Instead the goalkeeper Tom\xc3\xa1s Mej\xc3\xadas kept the scores level until the interval with a string of fine saves, denying Stevan Jovetic in particular on four occasions, and when Bamford took advantage of some slapstick defending to put Boro in front early in the second half it was City who lost interest. Tomlin, who hit a post, and Albert Adomah, who narrowly failed to chip Willy Caballero, could easily have put the visitors further ahead before Kike made the result certain in stoppage time. Bamford, on a season long loan from Chelsea, was again involved.</p> <p>It was another notable scalp for Aitor Karanka, who admitted it was the best result of his short managerial career, yet even he sounded a little hesitant when it was put to him that with all the Premier League casualties his club might now be among the Wembley favourites. \xe2\x80\x9cMy thoughts are only on the next game at Brentford,\xe2\x80\x9d Karanka said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Championship is a very tough division to get out of and our first objective this season is promotion.\xe2\x80\x9d Romance is not quite dead, but the doctors are worried about it.</p> <p>Man of the match Patrick Bamford (Middlesbrough)</p>'
