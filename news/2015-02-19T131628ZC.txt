b'Diego Costa draws another blank  <p>While Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s draw against Paris Saint-Germain has been completely overshadowed by fall-out from the depressing pre-match events in the French capital\xe2\x80\x99s Richelieu-Drouot station, the underwhelming performances of several of Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s most trusted lieutenants may also prove a source of concern at Stamford Bridge. While an away score draw is an undeniably good result for the Premier League leaders, Mourinho has already acknowledged that it was only the \xe2\x80\x9cphenomenal\xe2\x80\x9d heroics of goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois that enabled Chelsea to avoid a potentially heavy defeat. </p>   <div data-embed-type="table" class="player-card player-card--football" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <div class="player-card__image-container">  </div> <div class="player-card__player"> <div class="player-card__position" itemprop="jobTitle">Striker</div> <div class="player-card__name" itemprop="name">Diego Costa</div> </div> <dl class="player-card__stats"> <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Appearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">6</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Goals</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">0</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">11</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots on target</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">64%</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Offsides</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">5</dd> </dl> </div>   <p>Several of Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s players looked extremely leggy during the second half in Paris, while Willian, Eden Hazard, Oscar and Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas all failed to impose themselves in the style Chelsea fans have come to expect. By all accounts there were extenuating circumstances, as all four had their preparations for the game interrupted due to injury or illness. Up front, Diego Costa looked his usual aggressive, snarling self, but was understandably lacking in sharpness having just returned from a three-match ban. What is not so understandable, is the striker\xe2\x80\x99s failure to score in any of Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League this season, considering his obvious talent and excellent form in the Premier League. </p> <p>Costa has featured in six Champions League matches for Chelsea this season, playing 388 minutes in total without finding the net. By this stage last season he had already notched up five goals in four European games for Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid. Chelsea have coped admirably without his goals thus far, but considering their lack of strength in depth up front, cannot realistically expect to win this tournament without more telling contributions from a man whose most recent goal in the competition came last April, against the team in which he currently stars. </p> A busy night at the office for Mark Clattenburg  <p> Related: Football Weekly Extra: Bring on the Europa League! </p>   <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s been a strange season for Mark Clattenburg, regarded by many as the best referee in England and one of just two whistle-blowers from the country, along with Martin Atkinson, in Uefa\xe2\x80\x99s elite category of match officials. For reasons that remain unclear the 39-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s employers at the Professional Game Match Officials Board appear to be keeping him away from the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s more high profile fixtures, a state of affairs that reached its nadir when he spent one match over the busy Christmas period officiating at a League Two fixture between Shrewsbury and Wycombe Wanderers. </p> <p>No stranger to controversy, Clattenburg famously incurred the wrath of his bosses in October after breaking protocol by travelling alone to the Hawthorns to referee West Brom\xe2\x80\x99s 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace in October, so that he could get back home to Newcastle in time to attend an Ed Sheeran concert at the Metro Radio Arena. He was subsequently punished with a one-match ban and seemed to be back in the good books upon being appointed to referee the top-of-the-table Premier League clash between Chelsea and Manchester City at the end of January, followed by West Ham v Manchester United a week later.</p> <p>Last night, Clattenburg found himself the centre of attention again, disallowing a Casemiro goal for Porto against Basel during a match that also featured a late penalty and nine yellow cards. With the home side leading 1-0 in Switzerland, the official came under the spotlight for disallowing what Porto believed to be a legitimate equaliser for offside, after a lengthy period of consultation with his colleague Kevin Friend, who had spotted a couple of Porto players obstructing Basel goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik. Replays showed the decision to be absolutely correct and may go some way towards pacifying pundits and team officials who continue to believe that goal-line officials don\xe2\x80\x99t actually do anything.</p>     Porto\xe2\x80\x99s Spanish midfielder Oliver Torres is shown one of nine yellow cards brandished by Mark Clattenburg, a record for this season\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League.  Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images    Business as usual for Cristiano Ronaldo <p>Any minor concerns Real Madrid might have had about Cristiano Ronaldo losing his mojo were ended last night when the Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or winner ended what was, by his own own lofty standards, a worryingly barren spell of three matches without a goal. The Portuguese striker last went three games without a goal for Real in 2011 and his 26th minute header was his 58th goal in 58 Champions League appearances for the Spanish side as they made it 10 victories in 10 games to equal the longest winning run in the tournament\xe2\x80\x99s history.Despite the player\xe2\x80\x99s record-breaking goalscoring exploits, Sky Sports\xe2\x80\x99 astute Spanish football expert Terry Gibson believes Real Madrid would be better off selling Ronaldo come season\xe2\x80\x99s end, saying that the player\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cindividual obsession with his own achievements is hindering the performance\xe2\x80\x9d of his team.\xe2\x80\x9cHe has phenomenal stats every year,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gibson. \xe2\x80\x9cThey get better and better but the all-round performance of Real Madrid is suffering because of his obsession with just scoring goals. They can\xe2\x80\x99t find the system that suits all the players that they\xe2\x80\x99ve got. We\xe2\x80\x99re talking one star player and just below that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about other world class players such as Toni Kroos, James Rodr\xc3\xadguez and Gareth Bale.\xe2\x80\x9cThis list goes on but he is above them. I just think Real would be better off taking the big money they would still get for Ronaldo and re-investing it in other world class players. I think they might be a better team for it.\xe2\x80\x9d </p>     Real Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s Cristiano Ronaldo gives it the full Paul McCartney after resuming his goalscoring ways.

Basel: OK, not literally winners, but despite failing to maximise their home advantage, the Swiss champions were pleased with their home draw against Porto and remain confident of progressing to the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time with a good result at their rivals\xe2\x80\x99 Est\xc3\xa1dio do Drag\xc3\xa3o. Fabian Frei, who loaded the chamber for Derlis Gonz\xc3\xa1lez to fire the home side into a first-half lead, conceded that Basel hadn\xe2\x80\x99t played their best, but remains optimistic they can make it further after qualifying from the group stages at Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s expense. </p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere are many things we can do better, but we have two or three weeks to look at it, and it\xe2\x80\x99s another game,\xe2\x80\x9d said Frei. \xe2\x80\x9cWe scored a goal today, we can certainly score a goal in Porto, and with that, everything is possible.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Losers ... Bayern Munich: OK, not literally losers, but despite having almost 75% of possession in the first half of their surprise draw with Shakhtar Donetsk in Lviv, Bayern Munich could only muster one shot on goal, which is some going for a team that last failed to trouble a scoreboard operator in late October and has drawn just three blanks in 31 games so far this season. </p>   <div data-embed-type="table" class="player-card player-card--football" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <div class="player-card__image-container">  </div> <div class="player-card__player"> <div class="player-card__position" itemprop="jobTitle">Midfielder</div> <div class="player-card__name" itemprop="name">Xabi Alonso</div> </div> <dl class="player-card__stats"> <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Appearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">6</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Free Kicks</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">23</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Corners</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">16</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Crosses</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">6</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Assists</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">0</dd> </dl> </div>   <p>With the Spanish referee Alberto Mallenco having controversially presented Xabi Alonso with two yellow cards followed by the obligatory red one to mark the midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s 100th appearance in the competition, Bayern will be forced to contest the second leg without their team\xe2\x80\x99s heartbeat and most consistently excellent player. </p> <p>While the Bayern manager Pep Guardiola refused to criticise his compatriot\xe2\x80\x99s performance as referee, the club\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive was far less reticent. \xe2\x80\x9cI have to clearly say that the referee was a catastrophe,\xe2\x80\x9d he harrumphed. </p> Further reading  <p> Related: Europa League gets serious with Champions League prize up for grabs | Paul Wilson </p>    <li>Cristiano Ronaldo back among the goals in Real Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s win </li> <li>Danilo holds his nerve to keep Porto in the hunt against Basel</li> <li>Mark Pougatch scores on ITV debut by letting football do the talking</li> <li>Chelsea condemn fans who pushed black man off Paris M\xc3\xa9tro</li> <li>Barney Ronay: Why Chelsea and football must step up</li> <li>David Conn on a depressing image of Chelsea, football and Britain</li> <li>Chelsea lack explosive edge to put PSG in their place</li> <li>Chelsea hold advantage despite PSG recovery</li> <li>PSG 1-1 Chelsea: five talking points from Parc des Princes</li> <li>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho hails \xe2\x80\x98phenomenal\xe2\x80\x99 Thibaut Courtois</li>  It\xe2\x80\x99s stats time again    <p>Based on historic results in European competitions, a 2-0 away win gives the away team a 97% chance to progress to the next round.</p>&mdash; Infostrada Sports (@InfostradaLive) February 18, 2015      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo equals Lionel Messi and Ra\xc3\xbal on a record 76 goals in all European competitions. #CR7</p>&mdash; Infostrada Sports (@InfostradaLive) February 18, 2015      <p>26% - Cristiano Ronaldo is responsible for more than a quarter (72 of 274) of Champions League goals scored by Portuguese players.
