b'<p>WRITE ON</p> <p>The Fiver was pleased to see Fabricio Coloccini\xe2\x80\x99s open letter to Newcastle fans on the club\xe2\x80\x99s website yesterday, which is saying something considering how pompous, passive aggressive and full of vacuous self-important bluster this medium of correspondence invariably seem to be. Coloccini\xe2\x80\x99s was no different, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll give him a pass on that one, because it\xe2\x80\x99s not like he and his Newcastle team-mates have any other kind of platform from which to demonstrate their togetherness and commitment to the fans of the club they play for \xe2\x80\xa6 unless, of course, you count those green, grass-covered rectangular ones they get humiliated on every week. But hey, why bother trying to win football matches, when you can just write an open letter or sign your name to an open letter that somebody else has written on your behalf?</p> <p>In the first demonstration of anything approaching leadership he has provided in several months, Coloccini began his missive by apologising \xe2\x80\x9cfor the moment we are going through\xe2\x80\x9d, a run of eight consecutive defeats that might trouble the compilers of the Oxford English Dictionary, which defines a moment as \xe2\x80\x9ca very brief period of time\xe2\x80\x9d. And while pedants may argue that in the cosmic scheme of things, a two-month spell without a win or draw is indeed fairly fleeting, The Fiver would argue that \xe2\x80\xa6 ah, you know what we mean and there\xe2\x80\x99s a Fiver Letters section down below if you really want to go down that road.</p> <p>Going on to waffle about how determined he and his team-mates are to win every time they go on the field, despite all available evidence to the contrary, Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s captain went on to say that the club \xe2\x80\x9cdoesn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to be in this position\xe2\x80\x9d, despite all available evidence to the contrary. He then added that \xe2\x80\x9cplayers and staff have come together in order to leave all past problems aside\xe2\x80\x9d, despite all available evidence to the contrary. Indeed, so united are Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s players and staff that their beleaguered interim boss John Carver doesn\xe2\x80\x99t merit so much as a passing mention in his club captain\xe2\x80\x99s open letter. Not one.</p> <p>Following on from this nonsense, Coloccini spends the rest of his missive begging Newcastle fans to get behind their team, a state of affairs which seems even more pointless and unnecessary than writing an open letter to dogs asking them to bark every now and then, or an open letter to The Fiver asking us to send out a series of unfunny football emails each week. Still, at least he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to pay for a stamp, eh? \xe2\x80\x9cToday we need you more than ever,\xe2\x80\x9d pleaded Coloccini, as if to suggest it is Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s players, rather than the fans, that have somehow been short-changed in the unwritten contract that\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to bind them. \xe2\x80\x9cIn these three games we need to be together, we need to be united, to be a family \xe2\x80\x93 a family that fights together against adversity, a family \xe2\x80\xa6 [blah-de-blah, empty rhetoric etc, and so on].\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of course talk is cheap and it will be interesting to see how Coloccini and his team-mates live up to this childishly simplistic nonsense when they take to the field this weekend. On the evidence of recent performances, their best chance of success might lie in writing another craven plea in open letter form. This one could be for the attention of West Brom, begging them to go easy and let Newcastle win.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Barry Glendenning from 7.45pm BST for MBM coverage of Barcelona 2-3 Bayern Munich.

Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s how they came up with that Blake Lively farrago. Anyway, watch.</p>            QUOTE OF THE DAY No1 <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was in Monaco I thought it would be good to have a family of footballers. So I made sure my brother Rotimi gets into a football academy in France. Within a few months; out of 27 players, he stole 21 phones \xe2\x80\xa6 A couple [of] years ago, I bought a house in East Lagon (Ghana) for $1.2m. I found it normal to let my older sister, Yabo Adebayor stay in that house. I also allowed my half brother (Daniel) to stay in the same house. A few months later, I was on vacation and decided to go to that house. At my surprise, I saw many cars in the driveway. In fact, my sister decided to rent out the house without me knowing. When I called her and asked for explanation, she took about 30 minutes to abuse and insult me over the phone. I called my mother to explain the situation and she did the same as my sister. This same sister says I am ungrateful\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s Emmanuel Adebayor offers an insight into his family strife.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY No2 <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing new I can say. He\xe2\x80\x99s spectacular, incredible. He\xe2\x80\x99s playing further from goal and he\xe2\x80\x99s still scored 40 in the league. If he played in goal he\xe2\x80\x99d score 25\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Bayern\xe2\x80\x99s Thiago Alc\xc3\xa2ntara has a chin-wag with Sid Lowe about Leo Messi, why he didn\xe2\x80\x99t join Manchester United in 2013 and \xe2\x80\x9cgoing in hard\xe2\x80\x9d on his brother Rafinha tonight.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI noted priest Stephen Foster\xe2\x80\x99s prayer on behalf of his beloved Newcastle (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Quote of the Day), but rather doubt that a Christian god would be a fan of Newcastle. Their black and white stripes might represent the dichotomy of good and evil, and lead to some Manichean doubting, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe god would wish to be associated with such uncertainty. However, on a more positive note for the much-needed divine intervention, the magpie was the companion of Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, so any bacchanalians out there might be able to give Mr Carver a helping hand. I believe there are a few on Tyneside right now\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Nick Cox.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFair play to Stephen Foster for filling the void for the Premier League club who haven\xe2\x80\x99t a prayer. But he might want to reconsider the wisdom of praying to keep Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s stadium named after the first apostle to be martyred. Perhaps St Jude\xe2\x80\x99s Park (after the saint of lost causes) might be more apt for a team who, at this, stage probably couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even be saved by the third coming of St Kev\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Justin Kavanagh. </p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cCan I be among the many to point out, respectfully you understand, and in the timeless spirit of pedantry, that bulldozers do not have steering wheels (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver). They are equipped with steering levers, one for each set of tracks; to go forward, you push them both forward, to reverse, pull them both back; to steer to the right, you simply push the right lever forward and pull back on the left one: vice versa for travelling to the left\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 James Treacy (1,056 others who ignored the fact that The Fiver was \xe2\x80\x98dreaming\xe2\x80\x99).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
