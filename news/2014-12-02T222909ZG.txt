b'Gus Poyet: Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s insiders can help us against Manchester City'


b'<p>Gus Poyet can barely believe Sunderland have won their past four games against Manchester City at the Stadium of Light by 1-0 margins. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s incredible, it\xe2\x80\x99s unique,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot explain it, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why but I would take a fifth 1-0 at home. That would be perfect. Absolutely perfect.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s Sunderland have been largely unspectacular this season but the manner in which they held Chelsea to a 0-0 draw on Wearside last Saturday will have given Manuel Pellegrini pause for thought.</p> <p>Moreover the home side have three former City players \xe2\x80\x93 Jack Rodwell, Costel Pantilimon and Adam Johnson \xe2\x80\x93 eager to impart inside information about the visitors in their ranks. \xe2\x80\x9cThat could work in our favour,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poyet. \xe2\x80\x9cThey know about City. We talk about certain things and it is so much easier when you can confirm those things with these three players. I can tell you they have shared a bit of information with us \xe2\x80\x93 and every little bit helps.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Rodwell \xe2\x80\x93 who left the Eitihad Stadium in a \xc2\xa310m transfer last summer \xe2\x80\x93 impressed against Chelsea after a slow start to life at the Stadium of Light and a spell out of Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s first team.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think playing City will be special for Jack,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poyet. \xe2\x80\x9cWe paid a lot of money for him and he left on good terms but he wants to show he is still on City\xe2\x80\x99s level. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a great night for Jack. I hope he scores.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
