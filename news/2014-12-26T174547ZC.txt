b'<p>Chelsea continue to be dogged by accusations that their players tumble too easily to the turf after Sam Allardyce claimed Branislav Ivanovic \xe2\x80\x9cwent down looking for a penalty\xe2\x80\x9d as the home side maintained their three-point advantage at the top with a 2-0 victory.</p> <p>Ivanovic fell after a clash with Andy Carroll in first-half stoppage time, the West Ham United forward initially appearing to grab hold of the full-back\xe2\x80\x99s shirt but loosening his grip before the Serb fell. The incident provoked a furious reaction from Carroll and the goalkeeper, Adri\xc3\xa1n, with players from each side going head to head in the penalty area.</p> <p>The incident came after two Chelsea players were booked for simulation in the recent victory over Hull City, when Gary Cahill was fortunate to escape a second yellow card in that fixture for a similar offence. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought he went down looking for a penalty,\xe2\x80\x9d said the West Ham manager, his frustrations at a number of decisions having regularly been aired to the fourth official. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know about players being \xe2\x80\x98entitled\xe2\x80\x99 to go down looking for penalties but they do try and make the referee\xe2\x80\x99s mind up. Staying on your feet does not get rewarded if you\xe2\x80\x99re fouled. We all know that.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think the decisions went for us today but we all know the script for games like this, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve been in involved in games like this as long as I have. Some of the free-kicks given against us were very harsh indeed. None of them were particularly major. But you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to ask the referee. I\xe2\x80\x99m not paying any more money to the Football Association.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has consistently defended his players over the allegations of diving in recent weeks and claimed Ivanovic had been fouled. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s a penalty,\xe2\x80\x9d he claimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe other guy grabs him if you look at it on television. But it was an isolated situation. The game was good, aggressive but correct. The only guy who dived was [West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s Enner] Valencia and that was not in the box, and no one reacted negatively. A good victory for us, a good performance from the referee, a good performance, even if it was a defeat, for West Ham.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The win was a fifth in succession for Chelsea since they suffered their only defeat this season, at Newcastle in the first week of December, to maintain a three-point lead over Manchester City, who won 3-1 at West Bromwich Albion. \xe2\x80\x9cI am delighted,\xe2\x80\x9d said John Terry, whose second goal in successive matches had established the lead. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are playing well,\xc2\xa0everyone can see that, and the pressure is on [the teams below] now to win. If we continue to play well, it will be tough for everyone else. That is the target for us. We have had a good start and if we continue our form it will be tough for anyone. It is important we remain calm and keep doing what we are doing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Asked about his captain\xe2\x80\x99s form, Mourinho added: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s always had that [knack] of scoring goals. He\xe2\x80\x99s full of confidence. I see my John of 2004, 2005, 2006. I see him back. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see the difference. The only difference is when I see his twins at the training ground. They were born in that period when I was first at the club but now they are there running around and kicking balls. In him, there is no difference. He\xe2\x80\x99s playing so well. But when the team is playing so well, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy for the individuals to be performing at this level.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
