b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho facing Premier League punishment after press blackout'


b'<p>The Premier League is likely to punish Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho after he maintained his silence by failing to fulfil his media duties before or after Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s 1-1 draw with Manchester City at Stamford Bridge.</p> <p>It follows Mourinho cancelling his pre-match conference on Friday after he was fined \xc2\xa325,000 by the Football Association for alleging there is a \xe2\x80\x9ccampaign\xe2\x80\x9d against Chelsea in the aftermath of the 1-1 draw with Southampton on 28 December. He was further enraged by Diego Costa\xe2\x80\x99s three-match ban after retrospective action was taken for his stamp on Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Emre Can during Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s Capital One Cup semi-final.</p> <p>Premier League rules state managers must speak to rights holders the day before the game and the league will seek an explanation from Chelsea.</p> <p>Mourinho felt Costa was unfairly targeted by Sky and he refused to speak to the broadcaster before kick-off against City. There was also no representative from Chelsea for the post-match press conference. The Premier League is already investigating why Mourinho sent his deputy, Steve Holland, to carry out his press duties before last month\xe2\x80\x99s game against Newcastle \xe2\x80\x93 Holland also spoke to the media after the final whistle \xe2\x80\x93 and this latest incident is likely to lead to a fine.</p> <p>The draw kept Chelsea five points clear at the top of the league, although Manuel Pellegrini felt City were the better side. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that our team tried to win the game from the first minute until the end,\xe2\x80\x9d the City manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not easy to come here to the leaders of the Premier League. We created clear chances. That is why I am not happy about the point but I am happy about the performance of the team. From the first minute, we came for the three points.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini reiterated his belief that City can still win the title. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was important to try to close the gap,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe tried but we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. We have 45 points to win. It was not a final so we still have time to recover those five points.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It was an emotional occasion for the former Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard who made a late cameo against his old side. There were a few light-hearted boos when he came on, but he was afforded a fine ovation by the majority of the crowd. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Chelsea fans showed complete class at the end,\xe2\x80\x9d Lampard said. \xe2\x80\x9cI enjoyed this.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
