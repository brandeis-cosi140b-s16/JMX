b'<p>Fernando Torres is receptive to the possibility of moving to Milan, most likely on loan for the season, though talks between the Italian club and Chelsea have yet to reach agreement over the Spaniard\xe2\x80\x99s wage package.</p> <p>The striker, who moved from Liverpool for a then British record \xc2\xa350m in January 2011, has two years to run on his \xc2\xa3175,000-a-week contract and is unwilling to take a pay cut if he departs Stamford Bridge. Yet having rarely thrived over his three years at the club, there is a recognition that he will only ever play a fringe role at Chelsea after falling behind Diego Costa and even the veteran Didier Drogba in the pecking order.</p> <p>Milan have confirmed talks are underway between the clubs as they seek a replacement for Mario Balotelli, who joined Liverpool this week for \xc2\xa316m. They had inquired about the Merseyside club\xe2\x80\x99s Fabio Borini and Roberto Soldado at Tottenham Hotspur, but are now focusing on Torres, 30, as a high-profile forward to lead the line at San Siro.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOur goal is to take a great striker,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rossoneri\xe2\x80\x99s vice-president, Adriano Galliani. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will see if we achieve our aim, but Fernando Torres? He is a great striker. We are actively working.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea, who will also allow Marco van Ginkel to move to Milan on loan for the season, had initially envisaged retaining Torres as their third striker. Should they succeed in moving both the 2010 World Cup winner and Van Ginkel, they would have room to secure one more overseas player under Premier League regulations, with the Roma forward Mattia Destro having been heavily scouted by the London club.</p>'
