b'TEFLON SEPP <p>At the time of writing, Sepp Blatter is not in jail. Nor is he in an igloo or a space shuttle. No, His Holiness is exactly where he should be, still proudly astride his golden throne in Switzerland, contemplating ways to use another term as the hallowed father of Fifa to deliver even more joy and peace to the global footballing family. Amen.</p> <p>Uefa has decided not to boycott Friday\xe2\x80\x99s presidential elections in the wake of the FBI collaring a \xe2\x80\x93 what\xe2\x80\x99s the right collective term here? - brown envelope of Fifa executives; and Britain\xe2\x80\x99s Tory government, renowned for its intolerance of white collar chicanery, has called for Blatter to be replaced to help deodorise a sport that should be known for nothing other than the excellence of players from teams such as Aston Ham and West Harlequins and, oh, you know, all those others sides with great batsmen.</p> <p>But there are still people brave enough to stand up for the doctrine of Blatter Infallbility. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is yet another blatant attempt [by the United States] to extend its jurisdiction to other states,\xe2\x80\x9d stormed Vladimir Putin, who seemingly ranks suggestions of wrongdoing by Fifa alongside other fictional notions such as Big Foot, unicorns and Ukrainian sovereignty. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a clear attempt not to allow Mr Blatter to be re-elected as president of Fifa, which is a great violation of the operating principles of international organisations,\xe2\x80\x9d added Putin, without specifying whether due process should instead involve tanks and surface-to-air missiles.</p> <p>So that you no longer have to wonder what the head of the Guinea Bissau Football Association makes of all this, Manuel Nascimento Lopes piped up today to reassert his deep faith in Blatter and denounce the diabolical campaign against him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a Christian and this is blasphemy,\xe2\x80\x9d Nascimento Lopes blurted to Insideworldfootball.com, seemingly deifying the Swiss before hastily pointing out that this god is not omniscient: \xe2\x80\x9cPeople say Blatter must have known about this but do I know other people\xe2\x80\x99s secrets?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Follow the Fifa congress opening ceremony live right here.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe club wishes to state that tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s press conference concerns only footballing matters related to Napoli and not the future of Ben\xc3\xadtez\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Napoli club statement, 27 May.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI would like to thank the president, the club and all the fans because after two years I\xe2\x80\x99m finishing my experience here with Napoli\xe2\x80\x9d - Rafa Benitez, 28 May.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>[Snip \xe2\x80\x93 Fiver Lawyers].</p> <p>[Snip \xe2\x80\x93 Fiver Lawyers].</p> <p>[Snip-snippety-snip \xe2\x80\x93 Fiver Lawyers].</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHang on a minute. It sounds like David Lagercrantz [yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver quote of the day] is actually the world\xe2\x80\x99s greatest ghostwriter and has nothing to apologise for if he managed to make Zlatan retrospectively concur that his \xe2\x80\x98Zlatan quotes\xe2\x80\x99 were actually Zlatan quotes. I managed to do the same for Mamady Sidibe when ghostwriting his book, but doing it for football\xe2\x80\x99s best and most humble gentleman doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like such an achievement. Hats off, Mr Lagercrantz! PS this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a plug for Mamady Sidibe\xe2\x80\x99s autobiography. Although if it were, I\xe2\x80\x99d mention that it\xe2\x80\x99s called The Luckiest Man in Football and that it\xe2\x80\x99s really good\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Stephen Glennon.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: Marten Allen (Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters). Chelsea fan here, I am more than fine with football being a stick of celery and I hope the metaphor never changes\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Damien Neva.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe Adrian Foster\xe2\x80\x99s letter about Xavi. Whilst I agree with the sentiment can I just point out that the \xe2\x80\x98one club man\xe2\x80\x99 is actually signing for another club? Much like Gerrard. And whilst Liverpool fans might presently tell us that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count, you can bet it will if he wins the USA! USA! USA!
