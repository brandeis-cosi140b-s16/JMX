b'<p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger regarded Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s 3-1 win at Hull City as further evidence of his side\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing improvement as Santi Cazorla targeted a title push next season. The victory, which effectively secures Champions League qualification, featured Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez scoring the team\xe2\x80\x99s 100th goal of the season in all competitions and Wenger could not have been happier.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI feel we have made progress as a team and tonight was a demonstration we have improved,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe played the kind of football we love to play with pace, quality and desire. Most importantly we\xe2\x80\x99ve made progress since the start of the season. We\xe2\x80\x99re playing a different way from September.</p>  <p> Related: Hull City 1-3 Arsenal | Premier League match report </p>   <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve passed a few positive tests. What is at stake now is to maintain our run and finish second.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cChelsea are worthy winners this season because they have been the most consistent team of all. Let\xe2\x80\x99s finish the season well, prepare well for next season and give them a good fight.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Santi Cazorla echoed his manager\xe2\x80\x99s sentiment and challenged his team\xe2\x80\x91mates to push for top spot next year. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course we want to win the title next year,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Spanish playmaker. \xe2\x80\x9cBut second place this season is for now the most important thing. We want to finish in the Champions League places and win the FA Cup final.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe team is in a good moment and we want to keep this level up until the end of the season.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s manager was also delighted to welcome Jack Wilshere back after a five-and-a-half-month lay-off. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was full of energy,\xe2\x80\x9d enthused Wenger who saw S\xc3\xa1nchez register his 15th and 16th Premier League goals of the campaign on a night when Aaron Ramsey was on the scoresheet with the two-goal S\xc3\xa1nchez.</p>'
