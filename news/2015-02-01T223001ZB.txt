b'Branislav Ivanovic says siege mentality helps Chelsea win games'


b'<p> </p> <p>Diego Costa will thrive on the notoriety from his stamp on Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Emre Can, according to his Chelsea team-mate Branislav Ivanovic. Costa was suspended for three matches following the flashpoint in the League Cup semi-final, which Chelsea won, and the issue has led to the hardening of a siege mentality at Stamford Bridge.</p> <p>Costa has denied the stamp was deliberate and Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho, Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s manager, has stopped speaking to the media, whom he blames for pressuring the Football Association into taking action and fuelling a campaign against his club.</p> <p>Costa, though, retains tremendous support at Stamford Bridge, with the crowd singing his name at the beginning of Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s 1-1 draw against Manchester Cityon Saturday, which kept the team five points clear at the top of the Premier League. Costa watched the game from the stands, alongside the injured Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDiego likes attention, he likes for people to speak about him, this makes him a better player,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivanovic said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is his way to play. For me there is nothing wrong with that. The ban I cannot speak about but for me this has happened a lot of times. During the one game, sometimes, someone is touched, sometimes not.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think this [siege mentality] is part of the mentality to win. You need to motivate yourself. To go over the limit. Even if you don\xe2\x80\x99t think someone is against you, you have to find motivation. It is important in winning matches to find extra motivation inside yourself. Sometimes we need to feel this extra pressure.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea are poised to announce the \xc2\xa323.3m signing of Juan Cuadrado from Fiorentina. The Colombian had a medical at the London club on Saturday and the only hold-up appears to be the finalising of Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa322.5m move to Wolfsburg.</p> <p>Didier Drogba, meanwhile, has said he will stay on as a Chelsea player next season. The 36-year-old striker signed for one year when he returned to the club last year but he told the French TV programme Telefoot: \xe2\x80\x9cNext season I will still be a Chelsea player.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ivanovic said he will be fit for Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Aston Villa on Saturday despite the pain of a deep cut to a foot that he suffered against Liverpool. The defender played on in that game and he came through the 90 minutes against City. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was really painful during the game, a lot of swelling, like any wound, but it\xe2\x80\x99s all right,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivanovic said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just a wound, it\xe2\x80\x99s open. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have stitches because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to close the wound because of the inflammation.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>John Terry, the Chelsea captain, has praised Ivanovic for his bravery. \xe2\x80\x9cAt half-time [against Liverpool] he had a hole in his foot, his sock and his boot were full of blood,\xe2\x80\x9d Terry said. \xe2\x80\x9cMost players would have come off but not him. He said: \xe2\x80\x98Glue it, doc. I\xe2\x80\x99m staying on.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho said after the Liverpool game that Ivanovic\xe2\x80\x99s blood-soaked boot ought to be put on display at the club\xe2\x80\x99s Academy as an example to the young players.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nice of him,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivanovic said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I think a lot of guys in the squad play on in that way. It was unlucky, a lot of blood. But I remember a lot of guys playing with blood on the face and this is a good thing, a real show of how we have to be as professionals. I really don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make this small thing, big. Thank-you Jose for what you said but I am really no different from the other players.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Chelsea winger, Willian, was forced off with a muscular injury against City and the club will make tests to determine its severity.</p>'
