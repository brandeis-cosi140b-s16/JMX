b'\xe2\x80\x98Rolls-Royce\xe2\x80\x99 player Emre Can is driving Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s top-four ambitions'


b'<p>\xe2\x80\x9cPeople want instant results and players get criticised immediately but we always knew it would take time.\xe2\x80\x9d Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99s barbed comment was aimed at the media for prematurely writing off Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s summer signings but impatience applies to all facets of the game. It is why, for example, Emre Can represents Exhibit A in the Liverpool manager\xe2\x80\x99s theory and not a threat to his Champions League ambitions on Sunday.</p> <p>Can is the standout success of Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa3117m transfer spree last year or, to use Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99s words, the \xe2\x80\x9cRolls-Royce\xe2\x80\x9d of a player picked up for \xc2\xa39.8m from Bayer Leverkusen. The 21-year-old was also on David Moyes\xe2\x80\x99s list of potential young recruits for Manchester United until the Scot\xe2\x80\x99s departure after 10 ill-fated months closed the route to Old Trafford.</p> <p>The Germany Under-21 international had not helped his prospects with two inauspicious Champions League performances against United while Moyes was still in charge, the second coming when Ryan Giggs orchestrated a 5-0 home defeat for Sami Hyypia\xe2\x80\x99s Leverkusen two days shy of his 40th birthday.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI played very badly against them,\xe2\x80\x9d says Can, left-back that night at the BayArena and keen to avoid a repeat at Anfield. The admission comes with a smile. He, and Liverpool, know too much can be read into auditions.</p> <p>Can did not complete a game for Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99s team until 29 December as he adjusted to the demands of midfield in the Premier League. An ankle injury suffered on international duty also affected his start and, despite opening the scoring against Chelsea in November, he was back on the bench for the next 10 matches as the manager sought a solution to Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s weak form. When criticism of the club\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctransfer committee\xe2\x80\x9d followed, Can\xe2\x80\x99s name was invariably mentioned.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy attitude was not to moan or make a big fuss about it but to keep calm and work hard so that when I got the chance at half-time against Burnley I could break into the side and stay there,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflects. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel very good at the moment, in good shape, and I feel I have the trust of the manager. I believe I am doing a good job and that is why I am playing, so I am happy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Can has been a permanent resident in the team since that 1-0 win at Turf Moor on Boxing Day, aiding Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s dramatic transformation into the in-form Premier League team of 2015 and vindicating the single-minded approach that saw him turn his back on Bayern Munich at the age of 19.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI left Bayern because I needed the game time,\xe2\x80\x9d the versatile midfielder explains. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not an easy step and some people might not have seen it as a step forward because I was going to a smaller club [Leverkusen] but for me it was the right step to do that. If I keep doing what I have been doing for two or three months I am sure they might regret me leaving one day but I want to make clear that I have nothing at all against Bayern. They gave me lot of good things, a good education and it was my decision to leave. I wanted more game time, so there was no bad blood with Bayern and I thank them for all they did for me.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn the long term I think my decision will increase my chances of playing international football. Without being disrespectful to Leverkusen, playing for Liverpool helps me more because I am playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world and I have no regrets making this step. It is very similar here to Bayern. The level was very high under Jupp Heynckes with a lot of passing exercises and training specific to the position you play. It\xe2\x80\x99s like that here.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>One of the few obstacles the Frankfurt-born player has encountered since moving to Merseyside is the language barrier. He was bemused to find himself described as \xe2\x80\x9clike a Rolls\xe2\x80\x91Royce at the back\xe2\x80\x9d for Liverpool when reading coverage of the Merseyside derby in February, for instance, but given the quote came from Rodgers he put two and two together and made vier.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I first heard about it I wondered what it could mean,\xe2\x80\x9d he admits. \xe2\x80\x9cWe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use that expression in Germany. We wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say something like that. But obviously I know a Rolls-Royce is a big luxurious car so I thought it must be positive, even though I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly what it meant. I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard the comparison before but I thought that in football terms there must be a positive association and it can\xe2\x80\x99t be a bad thing if the manager is saying something like that. I understand what it means now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Rolls-Royce claims its vision is to provide \xe2\x80\x9cbetter power for a changing world\xe2\x80\x9d and in that context the simile suits a player who has flourished since being introduced to Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s rejigged defence on Boxing Day. Potentially world class and able to \xe2\x80\x9cplay in any team in world football\xe2\x80\x9d in a couple of years are also among the Liverpool manager\xe2\x80\x99s tributes to Can, although there appears little danger of the flattery causing complacency. He responds: \xe2\x80\x9cI am proud a manager of the status of Brendan Rodgers spoke about me in this way but I know there is a long way to go and I need to keep on doing my best to get there one day. I need to keep on working.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He is less enamoured by comparisons to Michael Ballack and Bastian Schweinsteiger, however, two compatriots whose impact for club and country Can has been tipped to emulate. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a completely different player to Ballack and Schweinsteiger,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI admire the careers they have had and hope I will have a career like them but I want to go my own way and build a career for myself and to be known as Emre Can rather than another Ballack or Schweinsteiger.\xe2\x80\x9dIt is a measure of Can\xe2\x80\x99s impact, his composure on the ball and willingness, as Rodgers said, \xe2\x80\x9cto do the dirty work as well\xe2\x80\x9d that he has been mentioned as a possible future captain of Liverpool after only 24 starts. That may have to wait depending on Jordan Henderson\xe2\x80\x99s contract situation or who is recruited when Steven Gerrard leaves this summer, but Can already resembles one of the leaders that Rodgers craved for the team. His popularity at Anfield will rise further on Sunday should Liverpool overtake United in the scramble for Champions League qualification.</p> <p>Can was an unused substitute when Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s team inflicted Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s last defeat in the Premier League in December but is integral to their prospects now. \xe2\x80\x9cVan Gaal does a good job wherever he is,\xe2\x80\x9d says Can of the former Bayern coach. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I would definitely back Liverpool to beat them to a top-four finish.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Beyond this season, Can\xe2\x80\x99s aim is to secure a place in Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s midfield. He explains: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s fine for me in defence. The most important thing first of all was to break into the team, regardless of the position. Over the long term it is definitely my ambition to play in the midfield. I always have a drive to take me forward offensively wherever I am playing. The fact I am playing in the back three at the moment means there is no player behind me and I have the whole game ahead of me. There is space for me to bring the ball forward and I have the drive to go forward. I am enjoying it. We are a young team that needs to keep improving, because then there will be good years ahead.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
