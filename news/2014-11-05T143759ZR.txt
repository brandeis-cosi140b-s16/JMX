b'<p>Rio Ferdinand was punished for his \xe2\x80\x9csket\xe2\x80\x9d comments on Twitter because he is a role model, according to the Football Association\xe2\x80\x99s explanation for their verdict.</p> <p>The Queens Park Rangers defender was suspended for three matches and fined \xc2\xa325,000 for directing a jibe at a Twitter follower containing the word \xe2\x80\x9csket\xe2\x80\x9d, which the Collins English Dictionary defines as \xe2\x80\x9ca promiscuous girl or woman\xe2\x80\x9d. He was also ordered to attend an education programme.</p> <p>After a Twitter user sent the message \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe QPR will sign a good CB (centre-back) they need one\xe2\x80\x9d, Ferdinand replied by saying \xe2\x80\x9cget ya mum in, plays the field well son! #sket\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>In its written reasons for the judgment, the FA said that: \xe2\x80\x9cWith nearly 6m followers, Mr Ferdinand is clearly an experienced Twitter user and should know better. He is, without doubt, a role model for many young people. His responsibility is therefore that much greater.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>A letter from Ferdinand\xe2\x80\x99s solicitors had claimed that the use of the word sket indicated that the \xe2\x80\x9cmum\xe2\x80\x9d was able to play anywhere, such as the centre-back position and was not intended to denigrate the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s mother.</p> <p>But the FA said: \xe2\x80\x9cGiven the nature of the preceding comment, namely \xe2\x80\x9cget ya mum in, plays the field well son!\xe2\x80\x9d, the regulatory commission rejects Mr Ferdinand\xe2\x80\x99s explanation.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In its written reasons, the FA added: \xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately there is ... certainly no sign of remorse. The regulatory commission members extracted what \xe2\x80\x98mitigation\xe2\x80\x99 they could from the solicitor\xe2\x80\x99s letter, but again reminded themselves that Mr Ferdinand had simply not responded at all to the actual charge brought against him despite several requests for him to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Ferdinand told a Web Summit in Ireland that he would not appeal. Photograph: Brendan Moran / SPORTSFILE / Web Summit/  Brendan Moran / SPORTSFILE / Web Summit/SPORTSFILE/Corbis    <p>Ferdinand had returned to Twitter to express his frustration at the ban, posting a message that read: \xe2\x80\x9cIs humour even allowed \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m baffled! Ludicrous &amp; I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean the rapper.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>However, the FA noted that it was his second Twitter offence, the defender having been reprimanded after he appeared to endorse a description of Ashley Cole as a \xe2\x80\x9cchoc ice\xe2\x80\x9d in 2012.</p> <p>Ferdinand told a Web Summit technology conference in Dublin on Wednesday that he felt an appeal was pointless.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the point in doing it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe rate of success on appeals on these type of disciplinary panels is almost zero.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t see myself getting the games taken away: it\xe2\x80\x99d just prolong the affair, so I\xe2\x80\x99m nipping it in the bud now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He said that the fine and suspension has reminded him to be more careful on Twitter. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be mindful of what you say and when you say it. Normally I\xe2\x80\x99ve been quite good at that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
