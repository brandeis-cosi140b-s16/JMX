b'Head to head: Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s seven FA Cup clashes against Manchester United'


b'<p>Arsenal versus Manchester United was a fixture that dominated the chase for trophies in the late 90s and early Noughties \xe2\x80\x93 a rivalry in no small part formed by an epic FA Cup semi-final replay in 1999.</p> Arsenal 0-0 Manchester United <p>11 April 1999, semi-final, Villa Park Back in the good old days when semi-finals weren\xe2\x80\x99t tied to Wembley, Birmingham was the setting for a grim draw between the two teams dominating the English game, with little clue as to the fireworks that would erupt a few days later in the replay. The main talking point was a disallowed Roy Keane goal seven minutes before half-time. David Elleray, having initially given the goal, consulted his linesman and awarded offside for an earlier infraction by Dwight Yorke \xe2\x80\x93 a decision that would never be given with today\xe2\x80\x99s rules about phases of play. Nelson Vivas, filling in in midfield for the absent Emmanuel Petit, was sent off five minutes into extra time, but Arsenal defended stoutly to earn themselves a replay, a few short days later \xe2\x80\xa6</p> Manchester United 2-1 Arsenal <p>14 April 1999, semi-final replay, Villa Park \xe2\x80\x9cYou couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take your eyes off the action for a second,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Jim White in the Guardian. It was the last ever semi-final replay \xe2\x80\x93 penalties were used from 1999-2000 \xe2\x80\x93 and the old tradition was given a fitting send-off, with Gary Neville later calling it the best game he has ever played in. David Beckham opened the scoring in the 17th minute and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until the 69th that Dennis Bergkamp scored the equaliser. Soon after that Arsenal thought they had taken the lead through Nicolas Anelka, only to see the offside flag raised. But the game had swung in Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s favour. When Roy Keane was dismissed for a second yellow card, Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s side took control, and in the 90th minute Phil Neville conceded a penalty. Up stepped Bergkamp, down leapt Peter Schmeichel \xe2\x80\x93 and the tie went to extra time. It was the last penalty the Dutchman would ever take.</p>            <p>Arsenal dominated the ball, but in the 105th minute, Ryan Giggs, a second-half substitute, leapt upon a Patrick Vieira mistakeand darted between Lee Dixon, Martin Keown and Tony Adams before smashing the ball past David Seaman to score one of the great FA Cup goals. \xe2\x80\x9cThe two teams are very close to each other and in the end the luckiest won,\xe2\x80\x9d bemoaned Wenger after the match. But that luck took Manchester United all the way to the Treble that season.</p> Manchester United 0-2 Arsenal <p>16 February 2003, fifth round, Old Trafford</p> <p>Arsenal had to wait four years for Cup revenge. Following 2002\xe2\x80\x99s Old Trafford victory when they wrested the Premier League title back to north London with a comfortable FA Cup victory, Arsenal went back to Manchester still chasing a Treble of their own. Wenger rested both Thierry Henry and Bergkamp but a front line of Francis Jeffers and Sylvain Wiltord still proved too much for United in a typically bad tempered contest. The match turned on Giggs\xe2\x80\x99s bizarre missed chance in the first half. Presented with a clean run on goal by a mistake from Keown, the Welshman rounded Seaman, skipped past Sol Campbell and suddenly had just an empty net in front of him. 1-0, surely? But no. Giggs lofted the ball over the bar, leaving Sir Alex Ferguson open-mouthed. Arsenal took full advantage, a deflected Edu free-kick giving them the lead just before half-time, and Wiltord doubled the advantage seven minutes in to the second half. Arsenal would go on to win the Cup but the \xe2\x80\x9csignificant psychological blow\xe2\x80\x9d predicted after the result was not enough to help Arsenal top United in the title race.</p>            Arsenal 0-1 Manchester United <p>3 April 2004, semi-final, Villa Park Back to Villa Park, but no repeat of the excitement of five years before. Arsenal, in the midst of their unbeaten league season and on an 18-match unbeaten run in the FA Cup, were full of confidence. Too much, perhaps. With the second leg of a finely poised Champions League quarter-final against Chelsea to come three days later, Wenger opted to leave Henry on the bench in favour of J\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9mie Aliadi\xc3\xa8re \xe2\x80\x93 a decision he must surely have cursed as the younger Frenchman failed to make any impact. Arsenal hit the woodwork twice in the first half but could not make the breakthrough. Paul Scholes scored the winning goal after 31 minutes but in truth was fortunate to last the full 90 minutes. At a time when Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s team seemed a cut above their rivals, Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s side had taken to dishing out a bit of physical punishment and when Scholes\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful tackle on Jos\xc3\xa9 Antonio Reyes put the winger out with knee ligament damage it went unpunished. Freddie Ljungberg also suffered a broken hand and the physical and mental effects took their toll, with Arsenal following their Cup exit with defeat against Chelsea to end their European ambitions.</p>     Paul Scholes hacks down Jos\xc3\xa9 Antonio Reyes.

Manchester United had 12 shots to Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s four, eight on target to Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s one, 12 corners to Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s one in 120 minutes of football. Wayne Rooney hit the post and terrified the Arsenal defence throughout and United came close twice in the last five minutes of normal time. But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to be. Reyes was sent off in the final seconds but it made not a jot of difference. Patrick Vieira, captain and on-pitch embodiment of Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s reign, won the trophy with the last kick of his career at the club in the season when the Arsenal-United axis was finally broken by Chelsea at the top of the Premier League.</p> <p>Amy Lawrence wrote in the Observer: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a way to settle a consolation prize. What a way to separate the two biggest hitters in this historic competition. What a way for the FA Cup to be decided. For the first time in its long and illustrious life, it came down to penalties. With the shootout locked at 4-4, but United a kick down after Paul Scholes\xe2\x80\x99s effort had been parried by Jens Lehmann, Patrick Vieira and Roy Keane passed each other on the walk of footballing hell \xe2\x80\x93 the long march between the centre circle and the penalty spot.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThese two captains and symbols of their teams didn\xe2\x80\x99t exchange a word. A glance. Both knew what was at stake. Vieira belted his spot-kick past Roy Carroll. United had dominated the preceding 120 minutes, but Arsenal showed the mental strength to overcome the hex United had held over them. Defeated three times by them this season, this made it all worth it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Patrick Vieira lifts FA Cup trophy for Arsenal in 2005. Photograph: Reuters    Manchester United 4-0 Arsenal <p>16 February 2008, fifth round, Old Trafford Many an Arsenal fan looks back at this capitulation as the day that Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s last convincing title bid fell apart. It was a week later at Birmingham that Eduardo had his leg broken but the confidence blow of this defeat for a severely under-strength team at Old Trafford was defining. Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s side were on track for a first league title in four years (and what a puny drought that seems now), five points above United, eight above Chelsea. And so names such as Justin Hoyte, Armand Traor\xc3\xa9 and Nicklas Bendtner were sent like lambs to the slaughter. Ferguson rested Cristiano Ronaldo, but apart from that it was a full-strength team that tore Arsenal to shreds, Rooney opening the scoring after just 16 minutes, with Darren Fletcher and Nani making it 3-0 in the first half. When Emmanuel Ebou\xc3\xa9 was sent off after 48 minutes it was time for damage limitation and United added just one more goal in the second half, Fletcher netting a second. For a man with such success in the Cup, Wenger has often been accused of not taking the competition seriously. In 2008, he could offer no complaints of that criticism.</p>     Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Armand Traor\xc3\xa9 looks on dejectedly after Manchester United score in the 4-0 win at Old Trafford in 2008. Photograph: Michael Regan/Action Images    Manchester United 2-0 Arsenal <p>12 March 2011, quarter-final, Old Trafford Four years ago United hosted Arsenal at the same stage as now, and this time it was Ferguson who opted to leave out some regulars \xe2\x80\x93 but with rather different results to three years earlier. Manchester United had seven recognised defenders starting the game, while Arsenal were in fine fettle, Robin van Persie fit, Andrey Arshavin performing well, and Laurent Koscielny forming a decent partnership with Johan Djourou at the back. But it made no difference. Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s streetwise team swatted aside an insipid Arsenal side too content to play pretty passes with a worrying lack of end product.</p> <p>The Da Silva brothers took up unusual berths on either wing, and it was F\xc3\xa1bio who opened the scoring. Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s cross was met by Javier Hern\xc3\xa1ndez, Manuel Almunia parried and the Brazilian was there to tuck the ball away to put United up in the first half. It took just four second-half minutes for the tie to be put beyond Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s team. After Edwin van der Sar had maintained United\xe2\x80\x99s lead with a neat double save at the start of the half, it was that man again, Rooney, who doubled their advantage, latching on to another blocked Hern\xc3\xa1ndez shot to poke home. Arsenal huffed and puffed but to no avail and United proceeded to a semi-final they would lose 1-0 to Manchester City at Wembley. At least there\xe2\x80\x99s no danger of that happening for Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s team this season.</p>     Fabio Da Silva celebrates scoring Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s opening goal in the 2-0 quarter-final victory.
