b'Liverpool v Manchester City: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened | Jacob Steinberg'


b'<p>A word on Liverpool in a moment, but first let\xe2\x80\x99s deal with Manchester City, who followed up a fine first-half performance with a pathetic display after the break. For a team with so many talented players, they should be embarrassed by their lethargy in the second half. They are now five points behind Chelsea, they have played a game more and you do wonder how long Manuel Pellegrini has left in this job. Where was the desire? City strolled their way to this defeat. Mind you, they must be sick of the sight of Coutinho, who arguably topped his winner in this fixture last season with the goal that won this match. Jordan Henderson\xe2\x80\x99s goal was pretty damn good too and Liverpool - who, lest we forget, played extra-time and penalties in Turkey on Thursday night - move up to fifth place, two points behind Manchester United.
