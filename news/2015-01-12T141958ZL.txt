b'Lionel Messi helps Barcelona unite to avert a crisis \xe2\x80\xa6 for now | Sid Lowe'


b'<p>Not long after the game finished, the game began. \xe2\x80\x9cWinning is the only way to stop the wave,\xe2\x80\x9d Luis Enrique said following Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s 3-1 victory over Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid, but the night was not all played out yet. On the touchline, Neymar was asked who rules, Leo Messi or Luis Enrique? \xe2\x80\x9cBartomeu,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. In the treatment room, where the physio and kitman \xc3\x81ngel Mur has built up a mini-museum and confessional over three decades, Andr\xc3\xa9s Iniesta, Ivan Rakitic and Gerard Piqu\xc3\xa9 gathered to take a picture, all big smiles and thumbs up. And Javier Mascherano left the dressing room, strode along the orange corridor and made for the media, wearing his angry face and ready to rumble. It was time to send a message.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t study journalism,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I do know what the truth is.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Knowing it is not necessarily the same thing as telling it, but Messi\xe2\x80\x99s best friend in the squad had a job to do and came ready to shoot at seven days of stories after which the sporting director was sacked, Carles Puyol walked and the president called elections; in which the reports kept coming, the details making increasingly painful reading: Messi and Luis Enrique don\xe2\x80\x99t talk and when they do it\xe2\x80\x99s to argue, some ran, while others said Messi had demanded the manager\xe2\x80\x99s head. Off Mascherano went, heading down the line, challenging as he passed. The \xe2\x80\x9cChief\xe2\x80\x9d playing the chief.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very easy to pick up a microphone or a pen and say things,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is sensationalist stuff and, sadly, that sells, even though most of it is not true. What you lot say gets to people. In any group of 40 or 50 people, things happen, but that does not mean we\xe2\x80\x99re not united. There\xe2\x80\x99s lots of morbo [people getting a thrill from the dirty stories] but those of us that are inside know how things really are. There is no problem with Messi and Luis Enrique. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about [institutional issues] but when they stick us in the middle, you have to. It\xe2\x80\x99s not nice for them to try to stain you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Lionel Messi says he has no intention of leaving Barcelona </p>   <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDoes it annoy you for people to be talking about all that stuff?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNo. The thing that annoys me is when people invent things, that\xe2\x80\x99s what annoys me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSo you think it\xe2\x80\x99s all been made up? But journalists have been told \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cA source with malicious intentions is the same as an invention.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut it comes from inside \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean \xe2\x80\x98it comes from inside\xe2\x80\x99? Why do you say that? Because of what you read? But do they give names and surnames, the [passport] number, of their sources? It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to write things and not cite the sources \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhy couldn\xe2\x80\x99t they have invented them? \xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m asking you \xe2\x80\xa6 I am sure they invent things because I know what happened. Ask the journalist who wrote it: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if they invent [the story] or if the source invents [it]. It\xe2\x80\x99s very easy to say \xe2\x80\x98this happened\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98they told me\xe2\x80\x99. I could say loads of things that people \xe2\x80\x98told me\xe2\x80\x99. Would you be able to tell me if it [really] happened or not?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>And so it went, until Mascherano did. At the other end of the room a small crowd was gathering by the door to Bar\xc3\xa7a TV. Leo Messi had arrived; after a week in which he stood silently in the middle of the storm, it was time to talk. Through the glass they watched him and, while he was on the television, they listened. \xe2\x80\x9cThanks for giving me the opportunity to give my version of events,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as if he had not had the chance before. Reports that his father had spoken to Manchester City or Chelsea is \xe2\x80\x9clies\xe2\x80\x9d, he said; he has \xe2\x80\x9cno intention\xe2\x80\x9d of going anywhere; the reports \xe2\x80\x9churt\xe2\x80\x9d because they come from people who support Barcelona \xe2\x80\x9cor say they do\xe2\x80\x9d; he is \xe2\x80\x9cjust another player,\xe2\x80\x9d not the boss; and he had not demanded that anyone be sacked and \xe2\x80\x9cnever would\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cStop throwing shit,\xe2\x80\x9d Messi said, and that was it. Barely 40 seconds in a two minute interview. Messi got up and left the room while a man scurried along behind him carrying a blue box containing the trophy that he\xe2\x80\x99d been given for becoming the league\xe2\x80\x99s all-time leading scorer, probably the greatest player in the club\xe2\x80\x99s history. He headed past the line of cameras, ignoring the questions shouted his way, and out of the exit. It was just before midnight and the message had been delivered. It had been received too \xe2\x80\x93 differently by different people, and received doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always mean believed, but it had. Handily, a new enemy had been created: handier still, it was an external one.</p> <p>It did not really matter if it was true, it may be useful. Short term, it was necessary. When Luis Enrique refused to \xe2\x80\x9cconfirm or deny\xe2\x80\x9d reports on Wednesday, his words leant closer to the former than the latter and although he turned the focus on the media, the famous \xe2\x80\x9centourage\xe2\x80\x9d of which John Cruyff bemoaned, he did not deny them here either. As for the president, during an exhausting press conference on Wednesday he had not so much been on the ropes as tumbling through them and out the other side. Equally, not every player followed suit, Iniesta noting simply he was \xe2\x80\x9cnot aware\xe2\x80\x9d of Mascherano\xe2\x80\x99s words when asked about them. But last night, the response was a more effective one, an efficient exercise in crisis management.</p> <p>It was striking how in control Messi looked, how confident, and how clearly he spoke \xe2\x80\x93 a long way from the mumbling awkward kid they called \xe2\x80\x9cel mudo,\xe2\x80\x9d the mute one. It was striking too how determined Mascherano had been, so conscious of his role, of the significance of the message, the need to project an image of unity amid the division. This was an operation to contain the crisis and an impressive one. It was tempting to think it could even work, for a while at least. This result suggested that even if they cannot definitively resolve their differences, they can live with them and win with them. For how long remains to be seen.</p> <p>In the long term much will have to change for the manager\xe2\x80\x99s position to become sustainable. It is one thing to stop a wave, another to turn back the tide. Luis Enrique will not last beyond the end of the season, and the club have sounded out possible replacements to take charge sooner, but here was a hint he may at least get that far. The club\xe2\x80\x99s president, Josep Maria Bartomeu claimed he had called elections in order to \xe2\x80\x9creduce the tension\xe2\x80\x9d and now the players had contributed too, off the pitch and on it. It had started on it; the performance was a perfect platform for what came next.</p> <p>At one point Mascherano had asked, pointedly: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, and Messi ambled about tonight, did he?\xe2\x80\x9d The answer of course was \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d And that was the point. In midweek, Bartomeu had claimed he \xe2\x80\x9cknew\xe2\x80\x9d Messi and his team-mates were happy because of the way they played. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the best tactic in a season in which the on-field evidence suggests the exact opposite, but offer up the same argument now, after a victory, and it might even work. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything\xe2\x80\x99s OK\xe2\x80\x9d was almost believable after Barcelona beat Atl\xc3\xa9tico.</p>           Lionel Messi denies reports that there are rifts between him and the Barcelona manager, Luis Enrique    <p>Messi was superb and so were Barcelona; this was their best performance of the season, at the end of their worst week. They scored as many goals against Atl\xc3\xa9tico as they had in their previous six games against the league champions, finally winning after over a year of defeats against them. Diego Simeone said it best: Barcelona had been \xe2\x80\x9cexcellent\xe2\x80\x9d. He said: \xe2\x80\x9cthe velocity and intensity with which they started the game was better than us; they were dynamic, intense, and they have great players.\xe2\x80\x9d There was hunger, determination, and attitude; they were fast, focused and aggressive.</p> <p>It is impossible to nail down why, of course. Why this night, of all nights, did Barcelona play better than they have all season? It might have helped that this was their most natural, theoretically \xe2\x80\x9cstrongest\xe2\x80\x9d starting XI of the season, even if it was the first time they had played together. It probably helped that the front three fit together better with Messi on the right, encouraged by an out of position substitute right-back in front of him, and Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez at centre-forward. The fact it was Atl\xc3\xa9tico, the league champions who took the title off them on the final day of last season, motivated them too.</p> <p>Sometimes wins just happen, good performances too. As the coach Juanma Lillo once put it: \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes people tell me reasons why my team have lost, when even I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a clue.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet there was certainly something different about Barcelona. \xe2\x80\x9cThe most important thing was not that they had won, it was that they had deserved to,\xe2\x80\x9d as Ernest Folch astutely put it in El Peri\xc3\xb3dico. Rarely was the \xe2\x80\x9cconvincing\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cconvincing victory\xe2\x80\x9d more significant. They needed to win, sure; more importantly, they needed to win over.</p>  <p> Related: Barcelona 3-1 Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid | La Liga match report </p>   <p>Could it be that Barcelona produced their best performance because of, not in spite of, the crisis? By performing superbly, by racing into every challenge, by playing in a way that was almost hyperactive, a point was made \xe2\x80\x93 to multiple audiences, even if the post-game discourse was inevitably about players showing the press. The crisis provided a collective task behind which they could unite, and an obligation too, binding together against the \xe2\x80\x9cthem\xe2\x80\x9d. On the pitch at least.</p> <p>That coherence extended to the stands. A match that had appeared set up for a plebiscite, with 68% of supporters in one poll saying that Luis Enrique should be sacked, brought them back together. The loudest boos and whistles were reserved not for the manager or the president or any of the players, but the referee \xe2\x80\x93 the way that it was supposed to be. \xe2\x80\x9cI liked that,\xe2\x80\x9d Luis Enrique said. Unity was achieved. Precarious, perhaps, but unity nonetheless. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing we can say is play well and win so that people concentrate on that and nothing else,\xe2\x80\x9d Iniesta said. That was not the only thing, but it was the first thing.</p> <p>At the start of the game, the fans had chanted Messi\xe2\x80\x99s name. At the end they did too. If the chanting at the start was pointed, even a little needy, the chanting at the end was praise. Then they welcomed his words as much as they gloried in his goals. Messi had won and Barcelona had won too; he then won the game that followed the game, and so had they. The focus had shifted, the blame too, and the disaster had been averted. For now.</p> <p>Not far away, Luis Enrique was facing the media. Do you feel like the crisis is over, he was asked. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he shot back swiftly. \xe2\x80\x9cNext time we lose it will return.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Talking points     Cristiano Ronaldo offers Gareth Bale some startling news about his mother. Photograph: GERARD JULIEN/AFP/Getty Images    <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Gareth Bale provided a brilliant pass for the first and scored the second with a superb free-kick, meaning he\xe2\x80\x99s running at a goal every 9.5 free-kicks, as Real Madrid defeated Espanyol 3-0 \xe2\x80\xa6 and still some fans whistled him at the Bernab\xc3\xa9u. Which, quite apart from the fact that whistling your own player is rarely a good tactic, made very little sense. It started with a chance in which Bale was running clean through and put his shot just wide. Alongside him, Cristiano Ronaldo was calling for the ball and when he did not get it the response from the Portuguese was as furious, his anger externalised for all to see. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whore that gave birth to you,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted. Which, dramatic and bizarre though it sounds is a pretty common and relatively harmless phrase in Spanish. The week before Bale had run through and had a shot saved against Valencia when he might have passed it to Karim Benzema, prompting some to conclude that he is greedy \xe2\x80\x93 even though on both occasions he was clean through, entirely entitled to take on the shot, and probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t even see the pass.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBale probably feels stupefaction at the Latin character,\xe2\x80\x9d Juanma Trueba wrote in AS. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was whistled during one of his most complete games. The first goal was born with a long, fabulous pass from him, like a golf swing. He scored the second with an extraordinary free-kick. And between them there were gallops, good movement, and measured crosses, even with his right foot. Not enough, according to part of the Bernab\xc3\xa9u.\xe2\x80\x9d Fair enough, you might say. After all, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like he has scored in three out of four finals since arriving, including the goal that put Madrid in the lead in the Champions League final and the ludicrously good strike that won the Copa del Rey final, or like he has scored or assisted over 50 goals for Real Madrid in a season-and-a-half ... Oh, right.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Six hundred and ninety three minutes later, Celta had the chance to finally score a goal. There was just one problem: the man standing in front of Fabi\xc3\xa1n Orellana was the Valencia goalkeeper Diego Alves, now the best penalty saver La Liga has seen. He has saved penalties from Messi, Ronaldo and Freddie Kanout\xc3\xa9 and he saved from Orellana too. He has faced 32 penalties in Spain and less than half have gone in. 18 goals have been scored, he has saved 17, and there has been one wide and one off the bar. Luckily, Orellana did eventually get a goal \xe2\x80\xa6 over 12 hours since Celta last scored one. It finished 1-1 and they still haven\xe2\x80\x99t won since beating Barcelona at the Camp Nou.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Eibar are still La Liga\xe2\x80\x99s best Basque team after they beat Getafe 2-1, and Real Sociedad drew and Athletic lost. They will finish the first half of the season ahead of both too \xe2\x80\x93 the first time the best Basque side at the halfway stage of the season has been anyone other than la Real or Athletic since 1929.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Javier Tebas is the president of the league but he is not Charlie. Before the Barcelona-Atl\xc3\xa9tico game, pretty much everyone in the directors\xe2\x80\x99 box held up the slogan ... except him.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 And Sevilla are into the Champions League places, with a game in hand over Valencia.
