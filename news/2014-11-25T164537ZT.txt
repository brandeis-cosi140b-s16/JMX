b'A MASOCHISTIC NOD TO THOSE DAYS BEFORE THE LOTTERY WIN <p>Playing Bayern Munich is difficult at the best of times, what with their only discernible weakness being a goalkeeper that\xe2\x80\x99s grown so bored with never having to do anything bar deal with the occasional back-pass, he has taken to doing so with a range of avant garde flourishes that looks likely to end in ignominy sooner rather than later.</p> <p>Playing Bayern Munich is particularly difficult when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got one ear tuned into events in Moscow, desperately hoping for news that CSKA and Roma are playing out the draw that is crucial to your chances of Big Cup survival, assuming you can get a result against a Bayern Munich side that are unbeaten in 18 matches and currently scoring goals for fun. But that is the ordeal that awaits the players of Manchester City, whose best hope this evening is that Bayern Munich might go easy on them because they\xe2\x80\x99ve already won the group and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really be bothered trying too hard.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t find the tension, the power or the joy to qualify with the three points because the job is done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola, upon being asked how he\xe2\x80\x99d go about motivating his players for a match against a football club whose Big Cup campaign to date has resembled some sort of weird nod to masochistic fans who pine for the halcyon days before their lottery win when they lurched from one comedy crisis to the other. \xe2\x80\x9cThe game for them is more important than our game, but we always find the right way, something to be motivated, to be a competitive team. We have to defend our club.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>With David Silva, Edin Dzeko and Aleksandar Kolarov all knacked and Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 and Fernandinho sitting this one out on the naughty step, City manager Manuel Pellegrini is down to the bare bones and will be forced to throw inexperienced whelps such as Frank Lampard, Fernando and Samir Nasri into the white hot heat of battle and hope City fans who haven\xe2\x80\x99t seemed all that into Big Cup finally get behind their team, even if it means just shouting general encouragement from their living rooms while watching Holby City.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel there is any extra pressure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pellegrini, whose punishment for another Big Cup failure could be a multi-million pound bonus in the shape of a hefty severance payment. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s important for this club to do well in Europe; it\xe2\x80\x99s one of our targets, to improve every year. Tomorrow we will see the team fighting to the end to try and continue in [Big Cup] and I hope we will do it. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the team, plus myself, have a lot of faith that we can do it. I hope we will continue to have a chance until the last game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Quite why City haven\xe2\x80\x99t fought to the end, or even much past half-time on several occasions, to try and continue in Big Cup thus far is something of a mystery, with many questioning the hunger and motivation of players who are now so ludicrously rich they may no longer care about winning football matches. Still, with Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero on hand to carry his team-mates on those narrow little Argentinian shoulders, anything is possible. This being City in Europe, the Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s plumping for the draw City need to keep their hopes alive in the behind-closed-doors match in front of a handful of fans in Moscow, plus a tragicomic last-minute defeat for City in the behind-open-doors match in front of a handful of fans in Manchester.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Scott Murray for Schalke 0-3 Chelsea and Barry Glendenning for Manchester City 1-2 Bayern Munich at 7.45pm.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY     John Delaney, right, obviously.

It\xe2\x80\x99s a typically Irish thing we do, we sing songs amongst a group and you expect that to be kept within the group. Unfortunately on occasions people use camera phones in a sly way when they are not in your company and then they try to make something bigger out of it. If the song offends anyone of course I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 ah, but FAI chief suit John Delaney confirms that it is.</p> THE SECRET FOOTBALLER\xe2\x80\x99S GUIDE TO THE MODERN GAME \xe2\x80\x93 EXCLUSIVE OFFER FOR FIVER READERS <p>Fiver readers can get The Secret Footballer\xe2\x80\x99s Guide to the Modern Game for just \xc2\xa37.49 (RRP \xc2\xa312.99).

Imagine my concern for the unfunny and quite terrible tea-timely email I am accustomed to receiving when I read Monday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver and it came close to making sense #ReturnOurBS\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Samuel Kathungu.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe famous Liverpool Way (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver). It was set up so nicely for you. There were so many open goals, and you missed every single one of them. You could have gone with the Steve Heigh-Way. Or transposed G\xc3\xa9rard Way (miserable goth-singing bloke) with the Gerrard Way (miserable footballer weeping-bloke after his slip against Chelsea last season). It\xe2\x80\x99s not like you to miss an easy joke \xe2\x80\xa6 oh\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ben Graham.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not personally familiar with the roads on Merseyside, but this \xe2\x80\x98Liverpool Way\xe2\x80\x99 that Dalglish is harping on about, does it lead to a dead-end? Also, if this fabled street does exist, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it about time they kicked Glen Johnson to the curb?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Shaun Payne.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhile \xe2\x80\x98Last night I dreamt of Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez\xe2\x80\x99 (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s last line) had me singing \xe2\x80\x98No hope, some harm, just some teeth marks in my arm,\xe2\x80\x99 I realised there was no need to alter Morrissey\xe2\x80\x99s lyrics for the Uruguayan. He was a sweet and tender hooligan, but he swears that he\xe2\x80\x99ll never, never do it again and of course he won\xe2\x80\x99t, not until the next time\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Colin Seiler.</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

We don\xe2\x80\x99t need to go to the newspapers,\xe2\x80\x9d he told, erm, various newspapers.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Jack Wilshere has been ruled out for \xe2\x80\x98a while\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 which the Fiver understands to be slightly longer than \xe2\x80\x98a bit\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 after suffering ankle-knack against Manchester United.</p> <p>Ryan Giggs has come to the conclusion that the Premier League 2014-15 shutters may as well come down now. \xe2\x80\x9cI think everyone will agree Chelsea are head and shoulders above anyone else,\xe2\x80\x9d sniffed the United No2.</p> <p>Russia\xe2\x80\x99s former assistant manager, Christian Panucci, has taken aim at Don Fabio for not backing him over a pay dispute that caused him to leave his job last month. \xe2\x80\x9cHe behaved in a shameful way towards me and all the other Italians on the staff. I will tell him that to his face the next time I see him. A great manager has to defend his men and he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t done that,\xe2\x80\x9d sniffed Panucci.</p> <p>French police have nabbed just the 95 Ajax fans before the Big Cup match with PSG. The detained supporters were carrying iron bars, knuckledusters and ski masks and definitely not in the French capital to take part in Scrapheap Challenge.</p> <p>Police are investigating a serious blaze at a company that is refusing to make way for Tottenham Hotspur\xe2\x80\x99s new stadium, with the owners suspecting arson.</p> <p>Former Stuttgart manager Huub Stevens is now Stuttgart manager Huub Stevens again after jumping back into the job he left just months ago to \xe2\x80\x9chave a break.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>West Brom\xe2\x80\x99s Saido Berahino is to be interviewed by police after being arrested on suspicion of drink-driving on the M6 in Cheshire.</p> <p>And away-day burglaries are back! Victor Wanyama was reportedly relieved of his Range Rover and three TVs by thieves who got busy in and around the Southampton midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s home while he was trotting around Villa Park last night. \xe2\x80\x9cThey turned the house upside down and [Wanyama] is still in shock,\xe2\x80\x9d a member of his family told Nairobi News.</p> STILL WANT MORE? <p>Happy 33rd birthday Xabi Alonso you hero.
