b'Louis van Gaal not concerned by Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Football Academy'


b'<p>Louis van Gaal dreams of Manchester United being in Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s or Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s position in the league, though the manager is not concerned by the champions\xe2\x80\x99 new \xc2\xa3200m academy as he is \xe2\x80\x9cvery happy\xe2\x80\x9d with his own club\xe2\x80\x99s training centre.</p> <p>United are in third place, five points behind City and a further three off Chelsea, going into a weekend in which Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s team host Liverpool on Sunday. His side are hoping for a sixth consecutive win and Van Gaal, asked if he was looking up the table, said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo. I dream for Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s place or Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s place but now we have to live match to match and that is the most important thing. We have to beat Liverpool, which is more important than thinking about City or Chelsea.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Gaal was asked whether United were back in the title race, now they had reduced the gap to Chelsea by five points. \xe2\x80\x9cI said that when we were 13 points behind,\xe2\x80\x9d Van Gaal added. \xe2\x80\x9cWe now have a better possibility because I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Chelsea shall lose so much.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He was dismissive of the former United player Paul Scholes, who claimed City were attracting the better local youngsters. Asked about these comments he repeated the response to Gary Neville\xe2\x80\x99s claim that United\xe2\x80\x99s match with Liverpool would be akin to The Dog and Duck v The Red Lion, which came after victory over Southampton.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYes that\xe2\x80\x99s also a legend, yeah? I think he has to pay attention to his words too,\xe2\x80\x9d Van Gaal said of Scholes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe building and accommodation [of the City academy] is not so important. The philosophy and staff are \xe2\x80\x93 and then of course you have to work with the talents. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have time to compare talents and staff with each other. When I see what we have I know I am very happy. Now I am more occupied with the first team and that\xe2\x80\x99s more than difficult enough without the youth education.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Asked if Neville\xe2\x80\x99s pub comparison was disrespectful to United, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know the context of how he said that so I can\xe2\x80\x99t answer that, so I can only say what I have said \xe2\x80\x93 which is that as an ex-legend you must mind your words.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Gaal did agree with Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 comments before the clubs\xe2\x80\x99 meeting in August in a pre-season friendly that the Premier League would be a surprise to him because of its highly competitive nature.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYeah I think he said at that moment the truth and I have experienced that way also,\xe2\x80\x9d Van Gaal said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe big difference between the leagues and where I have worked before is the high rhythm of the game. I think also every club has a player who can decide the match and that\xe2\x80\x99s not so like in Germany or in Spain.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The manager compared Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere to el cl\xc3\xa1sico. \xe2\x80\x9cBarcelona v Real Madrid was 102,000. The stadium was adapted to 102,000 and they were sitting there and I won my first game [in charge of Bar\xc3\xa7a] against them 3-0 and I was very pleased,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s injury list has eased and he confirmed Radamel Falcao will be fit to start, if chosen. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I have only four players injured \xe2\x80\x93 only [Luke] Shaw, [Chris] Smalling, [\xc3\x81ngel] di Mar\xc3\xada and [Daley] Blind. Falcao could make a return,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, before adding of Smalling: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not so heavy an injury, he was very wise to stop immediately. I think it shall take two weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d Regarding Di Mar\xc3\xada, Van Gaal said: \xe2\x80\x9cI am not a doctor so I cannot answer but I know he is not ready for Liverpool.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Robin van Persie has insisted he is not affected by having turned 31 in August. \xe2\x80\x9cPersonally I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so but if you look at the papers then it\xe2\x80\x99s different,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a strange feeling \xe2\x80\x93 when you hit 30 and you\xe2\x80\x99re having a bad spell everyone say it\xe2\x80\x99s because you\xe2\x80\x99re 30 or 31 and things might be over for you.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s an age thing. I live a quiet life for my football and I\xe2\x80\x99m almost convinced now that I will play for many years to come at the highest level; at least that\xe2\x80\x99s what I want and what I\xe2\x80\x99m aiming for. The age thing is not an issue for me at all.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
