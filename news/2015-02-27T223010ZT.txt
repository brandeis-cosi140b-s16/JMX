b'Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino shows steel before Chelsea final'


b'<p>Mauricio Pochettino knows what it feels like to end a trophy drought \xe2\x80\x93 and we are not talking here about Tottenham Hotspur\xe2\x80\x99s three pieces of silverware in the past 31 years. That has to be classed as a mere shortage.</p> <p>When the Tottenham manager was in his playing pomp, he started the Copa del Rey final in 2000 for Espanyol against Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid and his club were seeking to halt a run without a trophy that went back to 1940.</p> <p>They did so, winning 2-1, in a game that was partly remembered for how the Espanyol striker Ra\xc3\xbal Tamudo headed the ball out of Toni Jim\xc3\xa9nez\xe2\x80\x99s hands before scoring the opening goal. Jim\xc3\xa9nez is now Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s goalkeeping coach at Tottenham.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a very special moment. After 60 years, Espanyol had won a trophy,\xe2\x80\x9d Pochettino said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was very happy for that. But, it was a long time ago.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Argentinian comes across as resolutely unsentimental; a ruthless, hard-edged professional and, if the approach has underpinned his man-management decisions in his eight months at Tottenham, it will certainly do so for Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s Capital One Cup final against Chelsea.</p> <p>There are the inevitable selection issues but none more teasing than the one concerning the identity of the starting goalkeeper. Michel Vorm has played in every round of the competition, helping to set up the club for the prize that would fire Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s tenure. The other option, though, is Hugo Lloris, the France captain and one of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s finest goalkeepers. It would be heart-breaking for Vorm but surely Lloris has to start? \xe2\x80\x9cIt is always difficult to communicate to the players who are not in the squad,\xe2\x80\x9d Pochettino said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut this is football, this is our job. I will tell the players on Saturday or Sunday. The players know that only 18 players can be in the squad and only 11 can start.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe players, like on the first day, need to understand that I am the boss.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI decide the squad, I decide the starting XI. It is true that it is a final and an important game but the players need to accept my\xc2\xa0decision.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s mind went back to another cup final from his playing days \xe2\x80\x93 the 2006 Copa Del Rey, during his second spell at Espanyol. Again, his club won \xe2\x80\x93 beating Real Zaragoza 4-1 \xe2\x80\x93 but, this time, Pochettino watched from the bench as an unused substitute. It is unclear whether he has adopted the theory of the revisionist now that he has become a manager but he insists that he respected the decision of the coach, Miguel \xc3\x81ngel Lotina, and he still felt a big part of the triumph. \xe2\x80\x9cAlways, I had respect for the decision from my manager,\xe2\x80\x9d Pochettino said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I didn\xe2\x80\x99t play, one of my team-mates plays. When you are a player and you sign the contract, it is for training, for you to give your best in that. After, you have to wait for the decision of the manager.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It is a novel idea \xe2\x80\x93 and a tough sell \xe2\x80\x93 that the notion of being a professional footballer is essentially about training hard, with the selection for matches representing some sort of cherry on top. But to Pochettino, the team ethic is everything and it is what he has tried to instil at Tottenham.</p> <p>He has spoken of how reputations mean nothing to him; how academy graduates are on an equal footing to multi-million pound signings and, also, of his desire to create a family atmosphere in the squad.</p> <p>He has at least two players for each position and he has sought to interchange them during blocks of matches, which have come thick and fast. No top-flight team in England has played more official games than Tottenham this season and they returned from Italy on Friday, after Thursday night\xe2\x80\x99s Europa League last-32 exit against Fiorentina. Chelsea have had a free week in which to prepare for\xc2\xa0Wembley.</p> <p>The signs are that Pochettino is winning the battle to impose his ideology. In several positions he actually has more than two players, and there had been the suggestion of a clear-out in January yet only Kyle Naughton and Aaron Lennon departed. There are remarkably few out-of-favour players (Youn\xc3\xa8s Kaboul, \xc3\x89tienne Capoue, Emmanuel Adebayor) and little dissent from the dressing-room. There is the general acceptance that everybody will get their games.</p> <p>Pochettino avoids controversy, he laughed when he was asked whether Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s current war footing might influence the cup final officials. Pochettino spends a lot of time in press conferences shaking his head. His focus is on a Wembley win, on showing off the mentality of his squad to what will be a global audience. They will start as the underdogs but their hopes have been buoyed by the Premier League wins over Chelsea and Arsenal since the turn of the year.</p> <p>Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s squad is impressively fit \xe2\x80\x93 the conditioning work he has overseen has paid dividends \xe2\x80\x93 and, as many of the players have remarked, they fight until the end. They have taken 14 points in the league on the back of goals in the final 10 minutes of matches while they have settled three cup ties with goals in the same period. Even if they fall behind to Chelsea, they will not panic.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI never feel the pressure,\xe2\x80\x9d Pochettino said. \xe2\x80\x9cEven in the difficult moments, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t felt the pressure. I have a good relationship with Daniel [Levy, the chairman] and he has never put pressure on me to get a trophy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The notion of an Argentinian leading Tottenham to cup final glory appeals to the romantic element of the club\xe2\x80\x99s support \xe2\x80\x93 think Ricky Villa, 1981. Pochettino just wants to win.</p>'
