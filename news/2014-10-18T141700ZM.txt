b'Markus Rosenberg: from West Brom reject to Champions League hero'


b'<p>Markus Rosenberg spent 18 months at West Bromwich Albion, played 650 minutes of Premier League football, started six games but failed to score a single goal. The only time he made the headlines was when he left, his decision to donate the entire contents of his home to a local charity earning praise from media around the world.</p> <p>So it must come as a surprise to some West Brom fans that this season, on returning to his homeland, the Swedish striker has been banging in the goals for Malmo, taking the club to the league title and into the Champions League. Three weeks ago he scored twice as Malmo beat Olympiakos 2-0 to pick up the first points a Swedish side had secured in the competition for 14 years, and he was on target again on Saturday.</p> <p>It is some transformation. At 32, Rosenberg is on top of the world and not even the disappointing spell at The Hawthorns can bring his mood down. The question that remains, though, is what went so wrong in England. In the summer of 2012 Rosenberg\xe2\x80\x99s contract with Werden Bremen had expired. The striker, 29 at the time, had had successful spells with Ajax and Racing Santander before joining the Bundesliga side and wanted a new experience in a new country. He chose England and the Baggies.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAll my earlier club choices I had taken pretty spontaneously but this time, when I could go on a free transfer and had a whole summer to think and choose, it turned out so wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cDuring my first season I got to play a bit, not often from the start but as a substitute. The following year I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even in the team.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI started one single game as a striker and came on a few times as a winger, which is not my position. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what happened that last summer. I scored every time I played during pre-season \xe2\x80\x93 even in the last game ahead of the Premier League start \xe2\x80\x93 but when it came to it I was benched. I realised that nothing was going to change. I guess it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t meant to be.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Steve Clarke was the Albion manager at the time but Rosenberg says his relationship with the Scot was \xe2\x80\x9cgood, to start off with. He explained how we were going to play, with two strikers, and the only other striker when I signed was Shane Long. But then they loaned [Romelu] Lukaku [from Chelsea for the season] and the coach decided to start playing with only one striker. Lukaku did really well and I never really got the chance up front.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The forward, who has 33 caps and six goals for Sweden, adds that he does not feel bitter about how his spell in the Midlands turned out. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not since I have been able to show that it was only during that year and a half that things didn\xe2\x80\x99t go well. I knew then and I know now that I would have made it in England if I had been given a fair chance. I was successful in Holland, Germany and Spain. Why would England have been any different?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Rosenberg did make big headlines, though, when he left. In February he and his wife Maria donated the entire contents of their home to a local charity. The Sue Ryder shop expected the donation to fetch around \xc2\xa33,500. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was for a good cause and every pound matters. We had no plans to make it public but it felt good to be able to lift the charity.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Back in Sweden it did not take Rosenberg long to find his goalscoring form. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been away for 10 years,\xe2\x80\x9d Rosenberg said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe timing was right. I got tired of being abroad when I didn\xe2\x80\x99t play football for a year and a half. It\xe2\x80\x99s easier to be at home when things don\xe2\x80\x99t work out. Malmo had something really good going on. I joined an already a strong team which only lacked a striker. I wanted to contribute to the team of my heart. I joined the club when I was five.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Before saying yes to signing, the Rosenberg coach \xc3\x85ge Hareide wanted to be certain that he still had the hunger. Their chat only took 10 seconds. The comeback has been fairytalelike. Rosenberg has steered Malm\xc3\xb6 to another league title \xe2\x80\x93 his first \xe2\x80\x93 and, going into the weekend, he has scored 13 goals and recorded 14 assists in 25 matches so far. He was decisive in the club\xe2\x80\x99s way into the Champions League group stage, with both goals in the return qualifying leg against Sparta Prag, which secured a place in the playoffs, and two goals when Malm\xc3\xb6 crushed Red Bull Salzburg in the second play-off match.</p> <p>Then came the victory against Olympiakos, leaving the Swedish team with three points after two games in Champions League group A. On Wednesday the Swedes are in Madrid for their hardest game so far, against Atl\xc3\xa9tico. Markus Rosenberg has played at Vicente Calder\xc3\xb3n before, for Racing Santander back in 2011. He expects the atmosphere to be a lot different this time against the reining Spanish champions.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a huge away game. They should run over us like every team in the Champions League should. But we have shown versus Juventus [Juve won 2-0] and Olympiakos that we can manage at this level. I think the match will resemble the one against Juve, where they took control. It was a good sign that we stayed strong for at least 60 minutes in Italy and created some chances. We believe in what we do. We will go to Madrid to enjoy the game, we will believe in ourselves and continue the way we have.\xe2\x80\x9dRosenberg\xe2\x80\x99s success story has increased calls for a return to the national team. But the striker, who represented Sweden in Euro 2008 and 2012, prefers to put all his efforts into his club team. And all the foreign clubs who have contacted Rosenberg\xe2\x80\x99s agent Martin Dahlin can expect a no. \xe2\x80\x9cThe plan had always been to retire here in Malm\xc3\xb6. But as they say, in football anything can happen.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
