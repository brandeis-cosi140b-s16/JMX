b'STICKY TIMES <p>Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez is 41 but it is believed that his seventh birthday party is still in progress somewhere in Catalonia, where a gaggle of bearded, straggly-haired and desperately weary guests have not yet reached the end of the Byzantine game of Pass the Parcel designed by their host. Of course, Mart\xc3\xadnez himself had to retire early from that game in order to give interviews to his school magazine, the parish bulletin, a pair of chatty hairdressers and everyone in the area with a functioning public address system, which, as it turned out, amounted to two stationmasters and a popular ice cream man, Se\xc3\xb1or Flake.</p> <p>In each interview Mart\xc3\xadnez exuded his usual positivity. Indeed, if you were to ask him even now about the epic ongoing parcel circulation at his childhood home, he would no doubt hail the character of his haggard former playmates, who have remained committed to a passing philosophy even after layer after layer after layer after after layer after layer after layer after layer after layer after layer of unwrapped paper revealed just another layer of paper.</p> <p>Or maybe not. Maybe some long-suffering, middle-aged Spanish version of Romelu Lukaku has finally had a word with Mart\xc3\xadnez. The Belgian sometime goal-getter, you see, has disclosed that he and several of his Everton team-mates banded together during the half-time break in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s night FA Cup tryst with West Ham to plead with the manager to allow them to get to the point more quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all said to the manager: \xe2\x80\x98Can we play a bit more direct sometimes?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d explained Lukaku, who as a result of the tweaked tactics hit a late equaliser against West Ham to end a streak of four defeats in a row for Everton. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a style of play where we keep the ball a lot but knew we needed to take more responsibility, play to my strengths more, and they did it perfectly,\xe2\x80\x9d added the striker.</p> <p>While some see Lukaku\xe2\x80\x99s revelation as evidence of rising dissedence against Mart\xc3\xadnez, the manager himself views it as a good thing. That is no surprise from a guy who could probably find positives amid the annihilation of earth by fire-breathing extra-terrestrial monsters but, in fairness, an ability to assimilate pertinent recommendations from underlings is a trait of a shrewd manager, whereas an inability to do so is a trait of the Fiver editor. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m always talking with the players and we try to prepare game to game and we always share a lot of information,\xe2\x80\x9d chirped Mart\xc3\xadnez, who stressed that he and his players are in regular consultation. It is surely only a matter of time before someone dares to put forward the notion of not defending like Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s Wigan any more.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the British papers wrote about my son smoking under the shower after Southampton game, this is b0llocks. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me as they are known for making stuff up. I have heard Wojciech smokes sometimes but he\xe2\x80\x99s not that stupid to smoke in the dressing room\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Wojciech Szczesny\xe2\x80\x99s dad sticks up for his lad, while also taking a pop at Per Mertesacker, saying the Arsenal defender shows \xe2\x80\x9cthe agility of a rhinoceros\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI enjoyed JT McWoosh\xe2\x80\x99s tale of supporter flaggery in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver. I used to work at a paper merchants and had access to many reams of blue and white paper. I got a sizeable amount of each, chopped them up into tiny, uniform squares and placed them all into a large bag, which I took to a Blackeye Rovers away game (I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember where, but it was an upstairs stand). I waited patiently for the right moment and the Rovers duly obliged, scoring a goal. In celebration I dumped the bag of paper squares over the safety rail, expecting a shimmering paper mirage dancing in the wind. Sadly I had seriously misjudged the weight of the paper used and it dropped in a lump, flutter free, directly to the stand below where a home fan toed it curiously with his foot. So very disappointing\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Marten Allen.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was one of those AFC Wimbledon fans singing \xe2\x80\x98we support our local team\xe2\x80\x99 on Monday (Fiver letters passim), and at that time I briefly wondered if that was correct, since I do indeed live in Wimbledon, rather than Kingston. But then we started singing \xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a crowd surfing womble\xe2\x80\x99 and I forgot all about it\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 James Bolton.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDelighted to read a rebuttal of the notion that only folks within some Bow Bells of SW19 are Dons fans. I write to you from the Andes of Argentina, Mendoza to be precise, Malbec country, where assorted family members parked ourselves in front of the box to witness Adebayo Akinfenwa\xe2\x80\x99s heroics the other evening against Liverpool. Indeed, delighted to report for you that the Beast featured this week in La Naci\xc3\xb3n, Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s equivalent of Big Paper, Adebayo hailed as the only football player weighing more than the combined kilos of gaucho and horse. My eldest son Mark, who as a five-year-old joined me at Wembley back in 1988 for the Crazy Gang triumph, watched from his home in Berkeley, California, such is the dedication to the cause. Quite simple, really. The Dons, back then and now, represent The Struggle, la Lucha as we say hereabouts, not the sad antics of lads earning \xc2\xa3300,000 a week who can\xe2\x80\x99t be bothered to sign a kid\xe2\x80\x99s autograph book. On a visit to Kingsmeadow last year, for the opening-day visit of mighty Shrewsbury Town, what a pleasure to see our fans remembering who we are and whence we come. $tevie Mbe should be so lucky to have tasted our hallowed ground before he departs for Hollywood ! Sorry, $tevie, but Vinnie Jones beat you to it\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 David Smith.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHmmm \xe2\x80\xa6 yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver had the following quote from Dante: \xe2\x80\x98This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make me laugh and when someone doesn\xe2\x80\x99t laugh, it means they are annoyed\xe2\x80\x99. Probably a good job he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t read the Fiver then\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Tom Murray-Rust.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
