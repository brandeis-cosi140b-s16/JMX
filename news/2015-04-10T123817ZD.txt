b'Diego Costa out for Chelsea until May at earliest, says Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho expects to be without his leading goalscorer, Diego Costa, until May at the earliest as the Spain forward recovers from his latest hamstring injury, sustained against Stoke City last weekend.</p> <p>Costa, who has been dogged by hamstring problems all season, had missed Spain\xe2\x80\x99s games against Ukraine and Holland over the recent international window to undergo treatment after suffering a strain in the win at Hull last month. He began on the bench last Saturday and was introduced at the interval, only to pull up after 11 minutes having damaged the hamstring yet again.</p> <p>While Mikel John Obi has recovered from a knee problem and Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas will feature against Queens Park Rangers wearing a mask after breaking his nose in a clash with Charlie Adam, Costa will be the only absentee for the Premier League leaders at Loftus Road on Sunday. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly Diego is injured,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody else is fine and ready. Mikel ready, F\xc3\xa0bregas with a mask but ready too. No problems.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Asked if Costa will feature again this season given the regularity of his hamstring strains, Mourinho stressed: \xe2\x80\x9cCertainly. For sure. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not concerned, not concerned. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to think about it for two or three weeks, until he\xe2\x80\x99s ready to play. That\xe2\x80\x99s my approach. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to cry about it until he can play. You know, I think we have eight matches to play. If he plays four, it\xe2\x80\x99s normal. If he plays three, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit below what I\xe2\x80\x99m expecting. If he plays five, it\xe2\x80\x99s more than I\xe2\x80\x99m expecting. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about four matches to play.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>That would leave the 26-year-old targeting the visit of Crystal Palace to Stamford Bridge on 3 May, most likely ruling him out of the games against QPR, Manchester United, Arsenal and Leicester City. The player underwent scans this week on his left leg which revealed a tear, though Chelsea will only decide how best to treat the problem long-term at the end of the current campaign. The club are reluctant to put the \xc2\xa332m forward under the knife.</p>           Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho: Chelsea deserve to top Premier League    <p>That may still end up the likeliest option for them to pursue. Costa, whose impact for Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid in last season\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League final had been nullified by a hamstring injury, was hampered severely in the autumn by the issue, missing three weeks after the October internationals and being rested for Spain\xe2\x80\x99s fixtures in November entirely after tweaking the muscle.</p> <p>Mourinho would not be drawn on Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing interest in the FC Tokyo forward Yoshinori Muto. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t make bids, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not thinking about it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI know a little of him. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s nice for me to think about a player who plays for FC Tokyo. If the FC Tokyo coach spoke about my players I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be happy. But in modern football, when football is a business and an industry, you have to think about the financial situation: especially a club like Chelsea, who want to be in the rules and within financial fair play. It\xe2\x80\x99s important for us.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn modern management, you cannot close completely the door to a little bit of commercial interests. But we are a football club. We want to win matches and trophies. We don\xe2\x80\x99t buy players if we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe a player is a good player or a good prospect, that\xe2\x80\x99s for sure. A football club is always a football club and a top club only has space for very good players, or at least very good prospects. So no, we would never bring a player if he has no capacity to be in the squad for Chelsea FC.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
