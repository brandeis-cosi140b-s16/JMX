b'Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s Louis van Gaal considers selling Robin van Persie'


b'<p>Robin van Persie is fighting for his Manchester United future, with the club ready to consider offers for the Dutchman this summer.</p> <p>The striker, whose deal expires in the summer of 2016, wants to remain at the club and win a new contract. Van Persie will be 32 in August and is hoping to earn a one-year extension, in line with United\xe2\x80\x99s general policy with players in their 30s, but Louis van Gaal is considering allowing him to be sold.</p> <p>Since being a driving force in United\xe2\x80\x99s last title triumph in 2012-13, his first season at the club, Van Persie has suffered injury and failed to find his peak form. In that opening season he scored 30 goals but under David Moyes last season there were only 18, as injuries seriously hampered him.</p>  <p> Related: Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s Ashley Young covers up cracks against Crystal Palace </p>   <p>This campaign Van Persie has found the net 10 times in 28 appearances, scoring only twice in 2015. Speaking in January he admitted to being unsure about his future at the club. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not up to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the moment I am staying here for 18 months. That is it really. I can\xe2\x80\x99t look into the future. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what is going to happen after that. We shall have to wait and see.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Persie missed Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 victory at Crystal Palace because of a virus and has only Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s visit of Arsenal and the trip to Hull City on the season\xe2\x80\x99s final day to enhance his case. United\xe2\x80\x99s agreement to sign Memphis Depay from PSV Eindhoven this summer has increased the competition for places in attack.</p> <p>Juan Mata has welcomed the move for the 21-year-old. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know about the signing of Memphis Depay for the next season,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a young footballer who has shown his quality in the Dutch League. Like any new team-mate arriving here, he will be welcomed and we will help him to settle in quickly. But right now we must focus on the last two games.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s draw at Chelsea on Sunday had made it all but certain that United will qualify for the Champions League but Mata has urged the team on.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe are virtually qualified for the next Champions League, which is the least this club must achieve. It is true that being fourth we would have to play a qualifying round, but we will try to finish even higher, although in order to do so we don\xe2\x80\x99t depend just on ourselves. But it was vital for us to secure, at least, the fourth spot this weekend.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRegardless of the table it\xe2\x80\x99s a game we have to win. We owe that to our fans: they have always been supportive throughout the season, when we played good and when we didn\xe2\x80\x99t. We want to have a good farewell in Old Trafford for them, although there is also one more game \xe2\x80\x93 away against Hull \xe2\x80\x93 that we will try to win as well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p>'
