b'Repeatedly karate chop Gareth Barry in the windpipe | The Fiver'


b'LETS GET READY TO RUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMBLE <p>OOF! That\xe2\x80\x99s the sound of James Collins shipping a violent kick in the swingers from Romelu Lukaku. CRUNCH! That\xe2\x80\x99s James McCarthy jumping two-footed into Morgan Amalfitano\xe2\x80\x99s ankles. BIFF! That\xe2\x80\x99s Kevin Nolan chinning Leighton Baines with a right uppercut. INTAYA AYE ... YA BASTIRT! That\xe2\x80\x99s Steven Naismith getting all Begbie from Trainspotting on Enner Valencia\xe2\x80\x99s loaf. CHOP! CHOP! CHOPPITY-CHOP! That\xe2\x80\x99s Mark Noble and Aaron Cresswell teaming up to repeatedly karate chop Gareth Barry in the windpipe. DIDDLY-DIDDLY-DIDDLY-DI! That\xe2\x80\x99s Seamus Coleman Riverdancing all over a prone Reece Oxford. Look! His arms are by his sides as he inflicts mindless violence. RAAAAAAAAAKE! That\xe2\x80\x99s Matt Jarvis scraping his studs down the back of Phil Jagielka\xe2\x80\x99s calf and achilles tendon. BASH! That\xe2\x80\x99s Tim Howard racing off his line as the ball sails in from a corner to punch Carlton Cole\xe2\x80\x99s head clean off his shoulders. CRASH! That\xe2\x80\x99s Rob Green falling over and clattering his head off a goalpost as he attempts to kick himself up the @rse.</p> <p>Oh yes. The Fiver is looking forward to the orgy of violence that will be next weekend\xe2\x80\x99s rumble between West Ham and Everton, now it\xe2\x80\x99s emerged both teams are in danger of qualifying for next season\xe2\x80\x99s Euro Vase courtesy of Uefa\xe2\x80\x99s fair play ranking. With the Netherlands, England and the Republic O\xe2\x80\x99Ireland having been \xe2\x80\x9crewarded\xe2\x80\x9d with an additional slot to the first qualifying round, the choirboys of Everton and West Ham are in most danger of getting lumbered with the one given to the Premier League. Expect them to see the error of their well-behaved ways in their remaining games, as they lunge studs up into each other with abandon in the hope of fouling their way out of contention for an unwanted European odyssey that would begin on 2 July.</p> <p>In what is expected to be the first match in the history of football where footballers wave imaginary red and yellow cards at the referee in an attempt to get themselves booked, the two sides meet next Saturday at Upton Park, where there\xe2\x80\x99s every chance their respective managers will empty the dugouts ice hockey style in order to instigate a 90-minute brawl that will resemble a cartoon cloud with assorted fists, feet and swear words emerging from it. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fair play assessments are made by the official Uefa delegates on criteria such as positive play, respect of the opponent, respect of the referee, behaviour of the crowd and of the team officials, as well as cautions and dismissals,\xe2\x80\x9d droned a Uefa statement, which may very well prompt Big Sam to distribute flares, lighters and coins to West Ham fans before the game and then write five words in programme notes that read: \xe2\x80\x9cOn my signal, unleash hell.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In the interests of good housekeeping, The Fiver should add that it is actually Liverpool who currently lead and will win the Premier League fair play table, but they won\xe2\x80\x99t get anything for their troubles because they\xe2\x80\x99re going to qualify for Europe anyway. It is the first league they\xe2\x80\x99ve won in 25 years and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth a damn. Oh Brendan.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Follow Brentford 1-1 Middlesbrough in the Championship play-off semi-final first leg with Jacob Steinberg from 7.45pm BST.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLiverpool contacted us and talked with the player. They were also one of the clubs interested but at the end Memphis had the final decision and he chose Manchester United\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 PSV Eindhoven suit Marcel Brands explains that Liverpool were one of several clubs interested in signing Memphis Depay, who is off to Manchester United.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t something that was ever one we were interested in\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Brendan Rodgers explains that Liverpool were not one of several clubs interested in signing Memphis Depay, who is off to Manchester United. Oh Brendan.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver Letters, Andrew Collins wondered where The Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s STOP FOOTBALL bandwagon will go once it\xe2\x80\x99s left Spain. May I suggest the Ryman Premier League? Due to Enfield playing an ineligible player on two occasions earlier in the season and subsequently reaching the play-offs, football has now stopped while the FA sort the situation out\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Danny Clark.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFurther to Steve Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Scottish pedantry and Fiver Ed\xe2\x80\x99s commentary, it would seem the SNP voting populace of Scotland are not fans of The Fiver. That got my little grey cells working (and that is hard, I assure you). Could it be that there is insufficient coverage of the beautiful game north of the border in The Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s hallowed pages? Or could it be that The Fiver deems the beautiful game north of the border is just less beautiful? Or could it simply have been that everyone in Scotland was just momentarily distracted by the election (sorry another election reference) and too busy to write in?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Derek Moir.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: John Carver maintaining that he\xe2\x80\x99s the best coach in the Premier League (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Quote of the Day). Who does he think he is? There is no way he is the best coach in the Premier League. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even the best coach at Toronto FC and that is a very low bar. In Toronto you could basically show up with a bag of cut oranges and random Xs and Os drawn on a chalkboard and you would do better than the nine managers we have had the last nine years\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Bruce Cooper.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhy oh why oh why? Why John, why? The man who has presided over the worst losing sequence since football was invented. The man who coached a team that went nearly two seasons without scoring from a corner. The man who coached the team that let in more goals in 2014 than the combined Bon Accord/American Samoa under-11 team would playing a team of Messi clones. The man whose motivation skills involve accusing almost the entire team of not trying (not you Tim or you Ginge) thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s the best coach in the Premier League. Unless \xe2\x80\x98coach\xe2\x80\x99 is now defined as \xe2\x80\x98the cone arranger\xe2\x80\x99 and John has suddenly developed a Gok Wan-esque ability to lay them down in pretty patterns, then the man has clearly been subject to a Mike Williamson tackle to the head. The only thing more worrying is someone appointed him in the first place\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Sheridan Smith.</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@guardian.co.uk.
