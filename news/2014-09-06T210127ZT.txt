b'Transfer window fans\xe2\x80\x99 verdict part 1: Arsenal to Manchester City'


b'<p>ARSENAL \xe2\x80\x93 Net spend: \xc2\xa346m</p> <p>Welbeck may not be a marquee signing like Falcao or S\xc3\xa1nchez (whose refreshingly earnest industry has won every Gooner\xe2\x80\x99s heart), but there\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of glee in gazumping Spurs and he possesses attributes that may complement Ars\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s ideology. The campaign could yet come a cropper over a lack of defensive strength in depth but Debuchy may prove an upgrade on Sagna. Above all, I pray Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s summer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t end up remembered for his greatest gaffe, should gifting F\xc3\xa0bregas to the competition prove even more calamitous than the sale of RVP.</p> <p>Bernard Azulay GoonersDiary.blogspot.com</p> ASTON VILLA \xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa36m <p>The deals that didn\xe2\x80\x99t take place brought the most joy and despair. Thank goodness Vlaar stayed (I watched the deadline approach through latticed fingers). Sadly Darren Bent is still at the club and, worse, is in the squad. The fans despaired about Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s signings before the curtain-raiser. But Cissokho and Senderos have looked composed and we\xe2\x80\x99ve won a couple, so the manager\xe2\x80\x99s a genius again. Sadly I fear the initial concerns will resurface. Cleverley divides opinion, but can someone who looked crap in a good team suddenly look brilliant in a rubbish one? I doubt it.</p> <p>Jonathan Pritchard Observer reader</p>  BURNLEY \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa38m <p>We accepted maybe \xc3\x81ngel di Mar\xc3\xada and Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez were out of reach \xe2\x80\xa6 and in the end so were Craig Dawson, Henri Lansbury and James McArthur. Even so, a summer with no outgoings and 10 incoming players has definitely strengthened the squad, although we did suffer a lack of sleep after waiting for Michael Keane to be confirmed at 1.20am on Tuesday. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we can be too disappointed with the business done. Now to getting on with picking up points; we\xe2\x80\x99re only eight points behind the leaders.</p> <p>Tony Scholes @Clarets_Mad</p> CHELSEA \xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa310m <p>For once it was a relief to be watching the \xe2\x80\x9chilarious\xe2\x80\x9d shenanigans of deadline day, smug in the knowledge that all our business had been done well in advance of that dramatic close-up of Big Ben as it bonged 11 times. We had, of course, addressed nearly all our areas of concern in the summer \xe2\x80\x93 striker, goalkeeper, left-back \xe2\x80\x93 and were really just in the market for a back up to our new pet rottweiler. That too was done in a relatively timely manner so we were spared the spectacle of a dozen half-wits bouncing behind an over-excited, yellow-tied, reporter. We seem to be finally getting the hang of this.</p> <p>Trizia Fiorellino ChelseaSupportersGroup.net</p> CRYSTAL PALACE \xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa311m <p>Securing Chamakh, Speroni, and Bolasie on new deals was just as important as getting in Brede Hangeland and Fraizer Campbell. Martin Kelly looks a decent acquisition and the addition of Zeki Fryers at left-back and the highly rated James McArthur in midfield were desperately needed. The return of SE25\xe2\x80\x99s prodigal son, Wilfried Zaha lifted the place after Tony Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s departure, but the fans are split on the loaning in of Kevin Doyle to replace Glenn Murray, who has gone out to Reading. Replacing a hero is never easy.</p> <p>Chris Waters @PalaceTrust</p> EVERTON \xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa333m <p>We could have signed Messi, Ronaldo and Ibrahimovic in the window and some fans would still have moaned. The problem is two of the new arrivals aren\xe2\x80\x99t really new \xe2\x80\x93 Romelu Lukaku and Gareth Barry were on loan at Goodison last season. But Lukaku did cost \xc2\xa328m, smashing the transfer record and surely a decent sign of intent. Muhamed Besic and Christian Atsu are fresh faces - both had good World Cups and should add to the quality. The poor defensive start to the season led to calls for strengthening in that department. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope the faith in Phil Jagielka and Sylvain Distin is repaid.</p> <p>Kevin Price Observer reader</p> HULL CITY \xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa325m <p>It was a hectic transfer window with 13 players arriving and 19 departing. Steve Bruce quickly addressed the problem areas from last season, signing Scotland left-back Andrew Robertson and wingers Robert Snodgrass and Tom Ince to provide ammunition for his strikers. The sale of Shane Long to Southampton for \xc2\xa312m and a serious injury to Snodgrass led to a second wave of attacks on the market. A ridiculously exciting transfer deadline day saw Hern\xc3\xa1ndez, Ben Arfa , Diam\xc3\xa9 and Ram\xc3\xadrez arrive to plug those gaps. The Tigers squad has more pace, power, guile and flair than ever before.</p> <p>Rick Skelton @HullCityLive</p> LEICESTER CITY \xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa310m <p>The \xc2\xa38m fee for Leonardo Ulloa was mocked, but he looks a good buy with two goals in the opening three games. Tom Lawrence is touted as \xe2\x80\x9cthe next Ryan Giggs\xe2\x80\x9d and should be considered a steal at \xc2\xa31m. Then, of course, there is Argentinian legend Esteban Cambiasso, who further amplifies the embarrassment of riches in central midfield. A total of \xc2\xa311m on nine players, including one that started over 30 times for Internazionale, was nothing short of miraculous. So much for \xe2\x80\x9cbig-spending Leicester\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Chris Whiting @ChrisRWhiting</p> LIVERPOOL \xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa336m <p>We signed the L contingent from Southampton pretty swiftly, ushered Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez out of the door and spent the rest of the summer playing back and forth over Alberto Moreno. We finally landed him and it was, City ricket aside, worth the wait. The big surprise was Mario Balotelli and the ensuing fuss, which might have helped take pressure off the other new recruits. QPR played tit-for-tat with Fabio Borini, long after we\xe2\x80\x99d forgotten Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my, and then, just when we thought it was all done and the window shut, we go in for free agent V\xc3\xadctor Vald\xc3\xa9s. And finally bye to Daniel Agger \xe2\x80\x93 sad to see him go.</p> <p>Steph Jones Observer reader</p> MANCHESTER CITY \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa332m  <p>Despite the deadline-day departures this was an extremely pleasing window. The signings addressed the key areas, with Mangala and Sagna bolstering the defence and Fernando adding some much-needed steel in central midfield. The acquisition of Caballero is also very astute: Hart hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really developed since being pushed by the presence of a true top-class goalkeeper in Shay Given. The only real worry is in attack, where the fitness of both Ag\xc3\xbcero and Jovetic will determine whether or not allowing Negredo to return to Spain was a misjudgment.</p> <p>Lloyd Scragg @Lloyd_Scragg</p>'
