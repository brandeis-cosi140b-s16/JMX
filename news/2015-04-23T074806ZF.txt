b'Football transfer rumours: Branislav Ivanovic to Bayern Munich or PSG?'


b'<p>Zinedine Zidane has been carrying on like a four-year-old again. He has announced that he likes Eden Hazard, a development that has been interpreted as bad news for Chelsea. For many people, it means that Real Madrid will be signing the Belgian wizard this summer. But what if this is a case of two plus two equalling SUMMER TRANSFER SAGA? What went unreported is that Zidane went on to say that he is also very much enjoying the new series of Mad Men and no one is writing that Madrid have identified Matthew Weiner as the man to lead their line next season.</p> <p>By the way, just so you all know, the Mill has been announcing that it likes Hazard every day and no one has batted an eyelid. No one has even checked to see if the Mill secretly has hundreds of millions stashed away, ready to splurge it all on Hazard. Obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s no money, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the point. The point is no one listens.</p> <p>Anyway. Chelsea could also be set to lose Branislav Ivanovic, a target for Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain. Not to worry, though, they\xe2\x80\x99ll replace him with Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s Nathaniel Clyne.</p> <p>Southampton will cheer themselves up by signing Feyenoord\xe2\x80\x99s Jordy Clasie, but they could be about to lose Victor Wanyama to Arsenal. He reckons that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger is a fan. \xe2\x80\x9cWenger has been talking about me,\xe2\x80\x9d Wanyama said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he has let it be known he would like to sign me this summer.\xe2\x80\x9d The Mill is doing its unconvinced face.</p> <p>Internazionale are going to knock Asmir Begovic out and then place him in a room with news items from 2010 in a bid to make the Stoke goalkeeper think that they are still a big club. They\xe2\x80\x99ll make him think there\xe2\x80\x99s an important election on and then they\xe2\x80\x99ll entice him with a big contract. Foolproof.</p> <p>Inter also want Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9. So do PSG. By the way, his birthday is soon.</p> <p>Liverpool are going to dangle Rickie Lambert in front of Crystal Palace, while trying to make off with Yannick Bolasie for \xc2\xa310m. They are also sniffing around Roma\xe2\x80\x99s Radja Nainggolan.</p> <p>Swansea are eyeing Blackburn\xe2\x80\x99s Rudy Gestede, Sunderland are flexing their muscles in the direction of Werder Bremen\xe2\x80\x99s Franco Di Santo, THE MILL LIKES EDEN HAZARD.</p>'
