b'PSG v Barcelona: Champions League quarter-final \xe2\x80\x93 live!'


b'<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s that. Barcelona have one foot in the semi-finals after a masterclass in finishing from Luis Suarez. The Catalans were simply brilliant in attack, though PSG contributed to their own downfall, Edinson Cavani wasteful up front, David Luiz all over the place at the back. Barca didn\xe2\x80\x99t look all that at the back, a weakness that may cost them against better opposition, and PSG will clutch those straws going into the return leg at Camp Nou. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a long shot for them. And what an attack Barca have! Nobody will fancy drawing them in the semi, a stage they\xe2\x80\x99ve surely already reached.</p>     Xavi, Gerard Pique and Sergio Busquets celebrate a very comfortable victory.
