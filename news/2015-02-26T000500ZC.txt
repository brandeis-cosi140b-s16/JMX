b'Chelsea warn fans over antisemitism at League Cup final v Tottenham'


b'<p>Chelsea have warned supporters they will take the strongest possible action against any groups or individuals who aim antisemitic abuse at Tottenham Hotspur fans during the Capital One Cup final.</p> <p>The club, having consulted the Metropolitan police and Spurs, and conscious of events on the Paris M\xc3\xa9tro last week, published a statement on their website reminding supporters of their responsibilities on what is likely to prove a tense occasion at Wembley on Sunday.</p> <p>Chelsea pointed out that terms used by some fans \xe2\x80\x9cas a form of identity\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 by implication the word \xe2\x80\x9cYid\xe2\x80\x9d, which has been adopted by large sections of the Tottenham support \xe2\x80\x93 can also be considered deeply offensive.</p> <p>With that in mind, they called for calm surrounding the derby fixture. \xe2\x80\x9cFor a small minority, this game has historically brought a deeply unpleasant and unwanted level of antisemitic abuse, which has no place in football or anywhere in society,\xe2\x80\x9d read a club statement. \xe2\x80\x9cAs such, we urge everyone to keep their support positive.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOpposition supporters using terms as a form of identity is no excuse for abusive chanting or behaviour. The club asks that all supporters realise such actions cause huge offence to those around them. If we receive evidence supporters have engaged in antisemitic or any other form of discriminatory chanting or behaviour, we will take the strongest possible action, including supporting criminal prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The game will be played to the backdrop of troubling recent events, with Chelsea having suspended five supporters allegedly filmed singing \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re racists\xe2\x80\x9d and pushing a black commuter from a Paris M\xc3\xa9tro train. Seven men sought in connection with racist chanting at St Pancras International station after Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s 1-1 draw with Paris Saint-Germain have also been identified, the British transport police have confirmed.</p> <p>A group of presumed West Ham fans were filmed chorusing an antisemitic chant on a train as they travelled through Stamford Hill on Sunday to their game at White Hart Lane, prompting an investigation by the club to identify the culprits.</p> <p>The anti-discrimination group Kick It Out contacted police after seeing that footage, with their chairman, Lord Ouseley, having since urged the authorities to \xe2\x80\x9cswamp Wembley\xe2\x80\x9d in an attempt to prevent trouble at Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s game. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have always had a lot of complaints when Spurs play Chelsea,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have got to have a high [police] presence.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea are keen to demonstrate that last week\xe2\x80\x99s incident in France was an isolated act perpetrated by a small minority. \xe2\x80\x9cRecent events in Paris have seen Chelsea fans united in their contempt for a mindless few,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the statement. \xe2\x80\x9cChelsea is proud of the diversity within our club and our vision embraces equality regardless of race, gender, sexuality, disability or religion. We all share the common cause of supporting our team.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe launched the Building Bridges campaign in 2010 to promote equality and have worked hard to combat all forms of discrimination both at Stamford Bridge and in our communities.\xe2\x80\x9d The club had been swift to condemn those guilty of the chants in Paris, working with the police on both sides of the Channel to identify and suspend five fans pending further investigation. They will issue banning orders for life if there is sufficient evidence to confirm the involvement of that quintet in the incident.</p>'
