b'Football transfer rumours: Liverpool to sell Raheem Sterling for \xc2\xa350m?'


b'<p>STERLING GOING NOWHERE, screams the Times. HANDS OFF, yells the Mirror. YOU WON\xe2\x80\x99T KOP A MOVE, shouts the Star, as half of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s newspapers dedicate their back page to insisting that Raheem Sterling is absolutely, definitely staying at Liverpool for a very long time indeed. And then comes the likes of the Mail \xe2\x80\x93 CHELSEA IN RACE FOR STERLING \xe2\x80\x93 and the Sun \xe2\x80\x93 CHELSEA JOIN \xc2\xa350M STER WARS, RACE IS ON WITH CITY AND ARSENAL \xe2\x80\x93 who think he might be on his bike come the summer.</p> <p>The latter even say that in addition to England\xe2\x80\x99s current top three \xe2\x80\x9cboth Real Madrid and Bayern Munich [are] watching closely\xe2\x80\x9d. The Mill gets the feeling \xe2\x80\x93 a delicious tingling in the extremities \xe2\x80\x93 this one will, somewhat like its subject, run and run.</p>  <p> Related: Raheem Sterling offers Liverpool different challenge to Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez saga | Andy Hunter </p>   <p>The Sun also speculates about the future of another Liverpool forward, saying Fabio Borini is \xe2\x80\x9cwanted by as many as EIGHT clubs this summer\xe2\x80\x9d. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, however, reveal the identity of any of the eight, making this story \xe2\x80\x93 again, somewhat like its subject \xe2\x80\x93 not totally awful but just a bit weak in all key areas.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWho doesn\xe2\x80\x99t dream of having a player like him?\xe2\x80\x9d asks the Internazionale general director Marco Fassone of Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9, the \xc2\xa343m-rated Manchester City midfield dynamo in whom his club are apparently interested, \xe2\x80\x9cbut his wages and City\xe2\x80\x99s asking price might be a big obstacle\xe2\x80\x9d. A little further south, Lazio are also targeting England-based talent, having identified Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s Graziano Pell\xc3\xa8 as the ideal summer signing.</p> <p>Meanwhile in other Serie A/Premier League interaction news, the emergence of Oscar and Ramires as summer transfer targets for Juventus has raised Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s hopes that if they play their cards right they could end up landing pan-European top transfer target No1 Paul Pogba in a complicated players-plus-large-bag-of-swag arrangement.</p> <p>And now, the return of the hoary old Mats Hummels to Manchester United transfer rumour \xe2\x80\x93 not the last resurrection you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear about this Easter weekend, nor probably the most dramatic, but worth celebrating all the same. More than three years after the Mill first linked them and very nearly one since the rumours started to get a little more specific and regular, the defensive titan could finally be on his way to Old Trafford, with the Mirror quoting \xe2\x80\x9ca source close to the Germany camp\xe2\x80\x9d insisting that the Borussia Dortmund defender \xe2\x80\x9cis preparing his exit\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgave some players signs that his transfer is close\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>In other haven\xe2\x80\x99t-we-been-here-before, German-based-defender-related news, Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s long-rumoured move for Cologne\xe2\x80\x99s Kevin Wimmer appears to have been secretly completed, after the Austria coach Marcel Koller let slip that \xe2\x80\x9che switches in the summer to England\xe2\x80\x9d. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, his assessment of the player seems extremely encouraging: \xe2\x80\x9cOn the ball he is very calm, not rushed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of Wimmer. \xe2\x80\x9cWith his young age he still has potential to improve. He has it all.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Spurs have joined the growing list of potential suitors for Petr Cech, having identified the ageing Chelsea ace as an ideal replacement for Hugo Lloris should the French gloveman be poached by Paris St-Germain come summertime. They would have a fight on their hands, however, with Arsenal, Liverpool and, somewhat confusingly, Paris St-Germain themselves also interested in the Czech shot-stopper.</p> <p>Arsenal are poised to snap up the Velez Sarsfield \xe2\x80\x9cwonderkid\xe2\x80\x9d Maxi Romero within days, says the Argentinian website Dalefortin, though they\xe2\x80\x99ll loan the 16-year-old right back whence he came for two full years, before letting him spend a season or two in their reserves and then selling him to a middle-ranking club in Spain for a small profit.</p> <p>We conclude with a little general, non-specific pre-window transfer rumbling, as Crystal Palace\xe2\x80\x99s Alan Pardew trills that \xe2\x80\x9cthree or four additions in the summer and we could be a strong candidate for the top 10\xe2\x80\x9d, Stoke\xe2\x80\x99s Mark Hughes insists that \xe2\x80\x9cwe haven\xe2\x80\x99t spent a great deal since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been here but I never had the impression that, for the right player, funds wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be available\xe2\x80\x9d and Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s Garry Monk stomps that \xe2\x80\x9cwe need to up our game and improve our quality\xe2\x80\x9d. In short: roll on the summer, it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be a good\xe2\x80\x99un.</p>'
