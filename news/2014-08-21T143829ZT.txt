b'The Fiver | This sorry tale'


b'STORMING THE PALACE <p>Having no experience whatsoever in the field of sending unfunny digital communiques riddled with lazy stereotypes on a regular basis, the Fiver doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to make of today\xe2\x80\x99s big news regarding former Cardiff City manager Malky Mackay and his former head of recruitment Iain Moody. A good PR man might try to put a positive spin on those text messages alleged to have been exchanged between the pair by arguing that, if nothing else, they appear to have been equal-opportunity bigots. Their bewildering contempt for pretty much everyone across the board is apparently so eclectic that even gay snakes came in for criticism, while the one person to emerge with any credit from this sorry tale is Cardiff City owner Vincent Tan, who it seems is every bit the high-trousered, glove-wearing evil genius most likened him to in jest upon his arrival at Cardiff.</p> <p>While Mackay and Moody have yet to volunteer public defences the Fiver hopes will be slightly more nuanced than pleas of \xe2\x80\x9cBantz!\xe2\x80\x9d, Tan has ensured the former will not now be considered for the vacant Crystal Palace manager\xe2\x80\x99s job he was set to be given, while the latter has resigned as sporting director at Selhurst Park with immediate effect. The pair are now being investigated by the FA for alleged misconduct relating to their texts, while a number of transfers that took place during Mackay\xe2\x80\x99s time at Cardiff are also being scrutinised, presumably for evidence of shenanigans and skulduggery.</p> <p>Meanwhile at Kick It Out HQ, in one of those Fiver paragraphs that isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly ripe for giggles [\xe2\x80\x98one of those paragraphs\xe2\x80\x99? \xe2\x80\x93 Fiver Ed], the head of English football\xe2\x80\x99s anti-discrimination watchdog Lord Ouseley has said the revelations \xe2\x80\x9care further confirmation of how football is tainted with racism, $exism, homophobia and antisemitism, and the culture which continues to exist throughout the game and wider society as a whole. The reality is that these views are most dangerously held by those people in positions of power, and the football establishment knows and condones it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>So where does this leave Palace? Managerless and sporting director-less, with the club having released a statement saying \xe2\x80\x9cthere will be no further comment from the club\xe2\x80\x9d on the brouhaha surrounding Moody. With Glenn Hoddle having turned down the manager\xe2\x80\x99s gig and Tim Sherwood \xe2\x80\x93 hotly tipped to get the job as recently as Tuesday \xe2\x80\x93 apparently reluctant to take it unless he can bring in his coaching team, Steve Clarke, Martin Jol and Chris Hughton are the new same old names being touted as potential candidates to step off the managerial merry-go-round. In the meantime, caretaker Keith Millen will continue to oversee first-team affairs when Palace enjoy some respite from all this madness, with an actual game of football against West Ham on Saturday.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI dropped him off at his flat a couple of weeks ago and he asked me to go to the shop to get him some cigarettes. When I got back, I was invited in and we had a good chat about various things. I gave him the cigarettes and pulled out the signing-on form at the same time. He signed it there and then. I was chuffed to bits and ran to the car as fast as I could. I was skipping like a 14-year-old. I texted some of the other lads and told them I had a real scoop of a signing\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Chris Foster, manager of Bournemouth Sunday League Division Four side Abbey, says he has secured the signing of \xe2\x80\xa6 Paul Gascoigne.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel.

I googled him, because I\xe2\x80\x99m at work and have nothing better to do, and it states that in March 2014, he was \xe2\x80\x98banned from driving following a car crash\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98admitted failing to provide a breath test\xe2\x80\x99. Now, any psychic-medium worth their tour entrance fee should have seen that coming, surely?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Daniel Rice.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99m not the only person to have been moved deeply by Mr Demetriou\xe2\x80\x99s plight with Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s training-ground aroma (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Quote of the Day), but is he sure that it\xe2\x80\x99s the 200 tonnes of grass cuttings that is causing the stench and making his 11-year old physically sick? As the old line goes, there is hundreds of million pounds of manure running around on the field those cuttings came from. Surely that is a more likely source of the fetid aroma\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 David Price (and no others).</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
