b'Besiktas v Arsenal: Champions League play-off \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>An engrossing game and a dicey scoreline for Arsenal, who would have been a lot more sanguine about the second leg if Oxlade-Chamberlain\xe2\x80\x99s fine run and shot late on had not been foiled by Tolga Zengin. There were some good performance from Arsenal - all the defenders, plus Sanchez and Wilshere - but Besiktas showed that they have dangerous players too and could nab an away goal at the Emirates. Ba, Oguzhan and Ersan were all impressive. Ramsey will be out of that match, of course, but Ozil and the other Germans should be back. And Oxlade-Chamberlain deserves more starts pronto. </p>'
