b'Pellegrini defiant after Manchester City lose at Crystal Palace'


b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini insists that he does not fear for his job despite Manchester City falling to a defeat at Crystal Palace that leaves the reigning champions fourth in the Premier League, nine points behind Chelsea at the top and in a battle for automatic Champions League qualification.</p> <p>City were beaten 2-1 in south London despite dominating for large periods of the game, Glenn Murray and Jason Puncheon scoring for Alan Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s side before a late strike from Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 set up a tense finish. The result means they have not won away from Eastlands since mid-February and increases the pressure on Pellegrini.</p> <p>The Chilean did not concede the title to Chelsea in the aftermath of defeat, defiantly claiming that he is focused on his own team\xe2\x80\x99s results rather than potential permutations at the summit of the division. However, Chelsea have a game in hand over City and any turnaround now would require a remarkable collapse from Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side.</p> <p>Asked if he was worried for his job, Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo. [I am] never concerned about my job. That\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing I\xe2\x80\x99m never concerned about. I do my work and am very happy. You maybe have a difficult season, but you never worry about things like this.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to understand the result. We played a very good game from beginning to end, had a lot of chances to score. Crystal Palace scored the first goal which was clearly offside, and then a beautiful free-kick. It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to understand, but football happens like this.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn different moments in football, you can win or lose. I hope we continue playing like we did today and we are more lucky. Every point you drop makes it more\xc2\xa0difficult, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the same answer. We are not thinking about Chelsea or the title. Just about the next game at Old Trafford.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Palace\xe2\x80\x99s opening goal from Murray came in controversial circumstances. Scott Dann appeared to be in an offside position during the buildup and City\xe2\x80\x99s players protested vehemently to the referee, Michael Oliver.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a clear offside,\xe2\x80\x9d added Pellegrini. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first minute, there was another clear offside. The mistake the referee can do \xe2\x80\xa6 there was also after that a clear penalty and a lot of things happened in the game. But with the way we played, we must win this game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>City go into their next match, at Manchester United on Sunday, trailing their local rivals by one point in the hunt for a Champions League spot. Only the top three qualify automatically for the tournament but Pellegrini dismissed such concerns. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not thinking about that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m trying to win the next game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>For Crystal Palace and Pardew, the mood was certainly contrasting. Selhurst Park was buoyant once again as Palace propelled themselves to 11th in the table, a fine feat given they were embroiled in a relegation fight when Pardew succeeded Neil Warnock in January.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too much of a secret tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pardew. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was about resilience and good organisation. Great character in the team. It was an important first goal tonight to set the mood for the game. We managed to get it. I was disappointed we didn\xe2\x80\x99t control it better in the first half than we did, but we got another immediately in the second half. We got a bit of luck.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Regarding the title race, Pardew said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s difficult now, with nine points being the gap. A long haul. Psychologically for Chelsea, with all the pack closing in on them, the next defeat or draw for Chelsea will be a big test. You wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose that kind of lead.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cCity are going to have to play on that. There\xe2\x80\x99s a long way to go still, a lot of points up for grabs. But I can only look at us: we came up against a committed team; they weren\xe2\x80\x99t lacklustre or poor. They were very good and we had to ride our luck.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
