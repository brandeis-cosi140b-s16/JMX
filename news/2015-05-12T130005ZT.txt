b'The top-scoring Premier League defenders and where they are now'


b'<p>John Terry\xe2\x80\x99s performances for the Premier League champions this season have proved that all of the old faculties are alive and well. If his Indian summer has primarily shone through in the form of defensive nous, one statistic shows that the senses have not been blunted further forward either. The Chelsea centre-back\xe2\x80\x99s goal against Liverpool on Sunday was his 39th in the Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 on his 457th appearance \xe2\x80\x93 and made him the top-scoring defender since the division\xe2\x80\x99s inception in 1992. He heads up a roll call of buccaneering backliners:</p> 1) John Terry \xe2\x80\x93 39 goals (no penalties)     Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s John Terry, left, scores his most recent Premier League goal \xe2\x80\x93 against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge last Sunday. Photograph: Matt Dunham/AP    <p>Terry has always shown the timing of a striker from dead-ball situations, sniffing out space and making the most of his aerial prowess. There has rarely been anything fancy about his output, but leave him alone in the penalty area and the outcome is likely to mirror what occurs when a top striker is afforded too much space and time.</p> 2) David Unsworth \xe2\x80\x93 38 goals (22 penalties)     David Unsworth celebrates his goal for Portsmouth against Manchester United in October 2004. Photograph: Chris Ison/PA    <p>The former Everton and West Ham, among others, player was not the quickest of movers but had a hammer of a left foot, a feature that was evident in a series of penalties that left net manufacturers fearing for their products\xe2\x80\x99 durability. He could rampage forward from left-back and support the attack in open play, too. Unsworth and Terry are well ahead of the rest of the pack. These days, he heads up Everton\xe2\x80\x99s Under-21 side.</p> 3) Ian Harte \xe2\x80\x93 28 goals (10 penalties)     Ian Harte scores from the spot for Leeds United against Charlton Athletic in April 2003. Photograph: Alex Morton/Action Images    <p>Harte, who has just been released by the Championship winners Bournemouth, has missed the chance to add to his tally but, during his best years, his left peg was possibly the best around. Able to thud a ball just like Unsworth, he could conjure a remarkable amount of whip and bend as well, accuracy matching power. Sumptuous free-kicks were his preserve but he did not mind having a go with his right foot either.</p> 4) Leighton Baines \xe2\x80\x93 26 goals (15 penalties)     Leighton Baines of Everton lifts a free-kick over a Tottenham Hotspur wall to score in October 2010. Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images    <p>Left-footers certainly seem to have more fun, and Baines has at times resembled a playmaker at left-back for Everton. Penalties make up more than half of his output but, like Harte, he can hit a dead-eyed free-kick too. His first career goal, for Wigan in the Championship, set the tone for what has followed and in January he set a record of his own \xe2\x80\x93 becoming the top assist-making defender in the Premier League era.</p> 5) William Gallas \xe2\x80\x93 25 goals (no penalties)     William Gallas leaps highest to score for Arsenal against Chelsea in October 2007. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian    <p>Gallas often seemed rather underrated \xe2\x80\x93 the histrionics and controversial moves have tainted some memories \xe2\x80\x93 but his appreciation of space and danger were up there with the very best and saw him contribute particularly well for Chelsea and Arsenal in opposing penalty areas. He became particularly popular at Emirates Stadium when scoring the winner against his old club. He retired, fairly quietly, last year.</p> 6) Julian Dicks \xe2\x80\x93 24 goals (15 penalties)     Julian Dicks of West Ham, left, celebrates a successful penalty with Mark Bowen against Tottenham Hotspur in February 1997. Photograph: Stu Forster/Allsport    <p>Another thunderclap of a left boot, and it does not do Dicks a disservice to say he rarely needed to resort to subtlety. It should be pointed out that this figure does not include goals scored before the Premier League era for West Ham, which would add another five to his total. The left-back never missed about from the penalty spot and is now passing on his experience to West Ham Ladies, whom he coaches.</p> 7) Dan Petrescu \xe2\x80\x93 23 goals (no penalties)     Dan Petrescu, pictured in action for Chelsea against Aston Villa, enjoyed freedom in the wing-back role which came into vogue in the 1990s. Photograph: Richard Saker for the Guardian    <p>Petrescu, the first right-back on this list, had rather subtler gifts and was given the stage to deploy them in advanced positions fairly often \xe2\x80\x93 making the most of the wing-back role that came into vogue during the 1990s and having particular joy at Chelsea, where he scored around three-quarters of his league goals. He is now waiting for another chance in management, most recently coaching the Qatari side Al-Arabi.</p> 8=) Matt Elliott \xe2\x80\x93 22 goals (two penalties)     Matt Elliott celebrates scoring the winning goal for Leicester City against Tranmere Rovers in the 2000 Worthington Cup final. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian    <p>Elliott\xe2\x80\x99s most famous goals came in the 2000 League Cup final, in which he scored twice for Leicester against Tranmere, but his Premier League contributions were a signature dish of Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Neill\xe2\x80\x99s Leicester and few could challenge him when he got a yard on his man at a set piece. Elliott has had several coaching roles since retiring and works with Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s academy.</p> 8=) Sami Hyypia \xe2\x80\x93 22 goals (no penalties)     Sami Hyypia, second left, scores for Liverpool in the Champions League quarter-final against Bayer Leverkusen in April 2002. Photograph: Darren Walsh/Action Images    <p>The Finn\xe2\x80\x99s goals were spread out fairly evenly over 10 seasons at Liverpool \xe2\x80\x93 he never failed to score in a league season but never managed more than four in a campaign \xe2\x80\x93 and he was another whose presence in the opposition box at corners and free-kicks frequently wreaked mayhem. He is searching for managerial work after leaving Brighton earlier in the season.</p> 8=) Joleon Lescott \xe2\x80\x93 22 goals (no penalties)     Everton\xe2\x80\x99s Joleon Lescott, left, looks on as his looping header beats Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Joe Hart in February 2008. Photograph: Darren Staples/Reuters    <p>You have to cast your mind back a few years, but time was when Lescott was a reasonably regular name on the scoresheet. His most prolific year was 2007-08, when he scored eight times in the league for Everton. That output has dropped off in his time at Manchester City and now West Bromwich Albion, although he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t completely lost the knack of being in the right place at the right time.</p>'
