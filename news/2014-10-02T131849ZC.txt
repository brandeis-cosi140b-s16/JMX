b'<p>The knives have long been out for Alan Pardew. Now, though, they are pressed against his neck. Few expect Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s manager to survive a defeat at Swansea on Saturday; fewer supporters still would mourn his departure.</p> <p>You can understand why. Newcastle have sunk into the relegation zone having failed to muster a league win this season. More damning still, of the 17 ever-present Premier League sides in 2014, they have the fewest points (19), scored the fewest goals (19) and conceded the most (48). No wonder boos come as easily to some fans as breathing.</p> <p>One of football\xe2\x80\x99s most immutable laws is that when a team dramatically nosedive, the manager takes the fall but the situation at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park is not so black and white. Pardew has suffered a couple of huge slices of ill fortune by losing his two best players from last season, and also the rub of the green in matches. He might yet turn things round.</p> <p>Many will be mightily sceptical about that but even Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s most venomous critics would concede the departure of Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my to Chelsea was a deeply concussive blow. Last season Newcastle won 14 out of 26 Premier League matches when R\xc3\xa9my played, averaged 1.6 goals a game (helped by R\xc3\xa9my\xe2\x80\x99s 14 goals), and took 45 points. Without him their record was shocking: one win, one draw, nine defeats \xe2\x80\x93 and only one goal in 11 matches.</p> <p>Before then, the January sale of Yohan Cabaye to Paris Saint-Germain had already stripped the wind from their sails. Cabaye\xe2\x80\x99s final game for Newcastle was an away victory at West Ham on 18 January, when they were five points off sixth-placed Everton. Since then they have won only four times in the league.</p> <p>During Cabaye\xe2\x80\x99s time at Newcastle, they won 37, drew 16, and lost 26 of the 79 Premier League games he played \xe2\x80\x93 an average of 1.6 points a game. In the 19 games in which Cabaye did not appear, Newcastle won four, drew three and lost 12 \xe2\x80\x93 only 0.78 points a game.</p> <p>Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s scouting team have rightly been praised for unearthing several cut-price gems but there is only so long you can rummage in the bargain bin before picking up tat. The club\xe2\x80\x99s summer acquisitions \xe2\x80\x93 including R\xc3\xa9my Cabella, Daryl Janmaat and particularly Emmanuel Rivi\xc3\xa8re \xe2\x80\x93 have yet to adapt or consistently impress. Is that Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s fault, or the inevitable consequence of the club\xe2\x80\x99s parsimonious transfer policy instilled by Mike Ashley?</p> <p>Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s critics will point out \xe2\x80\x93 rightly \xe2\x80\x93 a record of 19 points in 26 Premier League matches since Boxing Day, with a goal difference of -29, is still a desperate return. Yet luck, or rather the lack of it, has probably played a part too.</p> <p>Luck is supposed to even itself out in football but in the short term it can play havoc with a team\xe2\x80\x99s bottom line. In the 26 games between Boxing Day and the present day, for instance, Newcastle had 278 shots, with 110 on target, and made five defensive errors \xe2\x80\x93 and their passing accuracy was 80.5%. Those Opta figures are very similar to Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s previous 26 games, from spring 2013 to Christmas 2013: 289 shots, 119 on target, three defensive mistakes, passing accuracy 80.3%. Yet in this earlier period they won 41 points and had a goal difference of -3, compared with 19 points and a goal difference of -29 in their most recent 26-game spell.</p>     Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s last 26 matches compared to their previous 26. Photograph: Graphic    <p>A cynic might suggest Newcastle are now taking shots from farther away, and conceding them in more dangerous areas but that is only partly true according to Colin Trainor, an analyst for Statsbomb.com, who has developed an Expected Goals model with his colleague Constantinos Chappas which assigns a probability of every shot in a match resulting in a goal, based on the location and type of shot, plus several other factors.</p> <p>After plotting every Newcastle shot and those of their opponents since Boxing Day, Trainor\xe2\x80\x99s model suggests that Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s side could have reasonably expected a goal difference of -8.5 rather than -29. Since 2010 only two Premier League sides (Chelsea towards the end of the 2010-11 season, and Liverpool between April and November 2012) were more unlucky according to his model \xe2\x80\x93 and both subsequently reverted to their true underlying performance.</p>     Chelsea.

Photograph: Colin Trainor    <p>In other words, given a long enough time, a team will tend to deliver the results deserving of shots they are taking and allowing. Incidentally, when Tottenham were flying under Tim Sherwood in February, Trainor wrote a contentious article saying it would not last because the underlying numbers suggested Spurs were enjoying more luck than normal. He was quickly proved right.</p> <p>Should Pardew get an indefinite stay of execution while he waits for his luck to change? Of course not. The manner of some defeats \xe2\x80\x93 particularly the 4-0 loss at Southampton \xe2\x80\x93 is a clear red flag and fans have repeatedly questioned his tactics. Managers also get stale and sometimes players no longer buy into their methods. Even so, in the past four seasons Newcastle have finished 12th, fifth, 16th and 10th \xe2\x80\x93 which, given their spending, is pretty much in sync with what you might expect.</p> <p>It is also worth pointing out that despite the recent slump, Pardew still has a better win percentage as Newcastle manager in the Premier League (36%) than any of the past five Magpies\xe2\x80\x99 managers. Has he really become that much worse since Christmas? Or has a combination of losing his best players, a lack of investment, and ill fortune played a bigger part?</p>'
