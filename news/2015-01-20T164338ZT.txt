b'<p>GIVE IT SOME STICK</p> <p>Back in the days before craft ale, beards and irony, Liverpool v Chelsea was tedious for just being a fixture. Between 2005 and 2007 the clubs met \xe2\x80\x93 let\xe2\x80\x99s think \xe2\x80\x93 789 times, producing 787 draws, three and a-half goals, a song about plastic flags and a cloud of Portuguese funk that still lingers over Anfield to this day. But at least that tedium was born of a proper footballing rivalry. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the fault of Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho or Rafa Ben\xc3\xadtez that Big Cup, FA Cup and Coca-Cola Cup tombolas kept pitting the clubs against each other every single time. The teams grew to know each other better than nonagenarian twins. So well, in fact, that games became notable for nothing of note happening in them. \xe2\x80\x9c$hit hanging from a stick\xe2\x80\x9d football, as Jorge Valdano called it. \xe2\x80\x9cThe extreme control and seriousness with which both teams played neutralising any creative licence, any moments of exquisite skill,\xe2\x80\x9d Valdano sobbed, after losing 97 minutes of his life watching the Big Cup semi-final second leg at Anfield in 2005.</p> <p>But anyway, the Fiver transgr \xe2\x80\xa6 diagr \xe2\x80\xa6 digresses. The point being that the cup success of the two clubs back then made the rivalry feel real. Mourinho and Ben\xc3\xadtez traded more blows than a couple of drunk kangaroos trapped in a sack full of adders. So when Brendan Rodgers, who has pitted his wits against Mourinho all of three times in his managerial career \xe2\x80\x93 losing three times \xe2\x80\x93 began to talk up a rivalry with the man he used to put the cones out for at Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s training ground, the Fiver was less convinced than that time Weird Uncle Fiver said he was giving up mannequins for lent.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9c[Winning a trophy would be easier] if you\xe2\x80\x99re a manager that comes into a dressing room full of experienced players that have won consistently,\xe2\x80\x9d barked Rodgers, trying to fan the flames of a very small fire after being asked when he\xe2\x80\x99s going to deliver his first bit of silverware to the Anfield trophy room. Rodgers, who accused Mourinho of parking a couple of buses in front of the goal at Anfield during the 2-0 defeat in April last season, also suggested that Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s name may no longer be on speed-dial. \xe2\x80\x9cWe probably don\xe2\x80\x99t have as much contact now \xe2\x80\xa6 the opportunity to work with him in that period of three-and-a-bit years was invaluable to me and hopefully in some ways I helped him because we had a lot of communication. But of course when you\xe2\x80\x99re fighting for the same competition, the friendship \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d peters out, the Fiver assumes.</p> <p>But while Rodgers continues to make out that he\xe2\x80\x99s heading down a path that could lead to him deliberately not liking the Chelsea manager\xe2\x80\x99s next Instagram post, Mourinho is busy trying to build bridges. In fact, he\xe2\x80\x99s been endearing himself to Liverpool fans before tonight\xe2\x80\x99s Worthington\xe2\x80\x99s Cup semi-final first leg at Anfield by imploring Chelsea supporters to stop chanting that tedious song about $tevie Mbe slipping on his effing tail and giving the ball to Demba Ba. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s an opponent I always admired and respected. There is a song that my fans have that I don\xe2\x80\x99t like at all,\xe2\x80\x9d harrumphed Mourinho, who usually baits Chelsea fans by telling them to make some noise. \xe2\x80\x9cA couple of times it\xe2\x80\x99s good fun but to go and go and go, especially when a player like him deserves respect, we don\xe2\x80\x99t need that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As for the match, after watching Chelsea tear Swansea a new one at the weekend, Rodgers shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too hasty in ditching Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s mobile number. He could do with asking him where he left the two buses he parked at Anfield last year. If he wants to create a real rivalry, he may need them. </p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Paul Doyle now for Ivory Coast 2-0 Guinea in the Africa Cup of Nations, and then Barry Glendenning will be here with Liverpool 2-2 Chelsea at 7.45pm GMT.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI find this behaviour shameful.
