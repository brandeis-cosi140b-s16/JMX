Atkinson throws his headphones at the producer. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can sit there and play with all your silly machines. If the boys play badly I\xe2\x80\x99ll whip \xe2\x80\x99em, but I ain\xe2\x80\x99t whipping them for that. Thanks lads, goodnight.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Oct 2000: Former Dundee United manager turned chairman Jim McLean weighs up a question from BBC reporter John Barnes, then slaps him. \xe2\x80\x9cI very much regret what happened and offer my sincere apologies,\xe2\x80\x9d he said later. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom what I know of John, he\xe2\x80\x99s an honest, hard-working lad who was only trying to do his job \xe2\x80\x93 as I was trying to do mine.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>            <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 May 2002: Alex Ferguson is asked about the merits of Juan Ver\xc3\xb3n, and plays it cool. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m no\xe2\x80\x99 fucking talking to you. Ver\xc3\xb3n\xe2\x80\x99s a great fucking player. Youse are all fucking idiots \xe2\x80\xa6 get out.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Sep 2008: Much-travelled Spanish manager Javier Clemente assesses criticism from journalist Manolo Lama, and reveals he wishes the reporter had died in a car accident in 1987. \xe2\x80\x9cHe insulted me 10,000 times.\xe2\x80\x9d Among Clemente\xe2\x80\x99s previous clashes: cutting short a reporter who tried to validate himself by saying he\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x9cseen a lot of football\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cThe cows at Lezama [Athletic Bilbao\xe2\x80\x99s rural training ground] watch football every day, and they haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a fucking clue either.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Oct 2008: Joe Kinnear holds his first official press conference at Newcastle.

How can you put your leg there where it can get run over, man?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Aug 2010: So then, Harry Redknapp \xe2\x80\x93 you made your name as a wheeler and dealer \xe2\x80\xa6</p>            <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Feb 2013: Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger calls out a journalist before Arsenal take on Bayern Munich. \xe2\x80\x9cI work for 16 years in England and I think I deserve a bit more credit than wrong information that has only one intention: to harm. I look at you not because you give information, I do not know if it is you, I do not know where the information comes from. Why do you look at me?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Apr 2014: The Guardian\xe2\x80\x99s Jamie Jackson puts a question to Pep Guardiola after Bayern Munich\xe2\x80\x99s 1-1 draw with Manchester United.

You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be more clever next time you come and don\xe2\x80\x99t ask insulting questions. If you do your homework you know there\xe2\x80\x99s not a dip in our form, there\xe2\x80\x99s been a dip in our results. Our form has been fine. The best form since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been here.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Jan 2015: Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho considers press criticism of Diego Costa\xe2\x80\x99s two accidents against Liverpool, and traces it back to Jamie Redknapp. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe you are already influenced by the campaign on the television. It is a great campaign, we know how much that pundit loves Chelsea and particularly loves me.\xe2\x80\x9d In March he develops the theme, calling Graeme Souness \xe2\x80\x9ca frustrated person \xe2\x80\xa6 Envy is the biggest tribute that the shadows do to the man.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Mar 2015: After Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s 0-0 draw with Hull, Pearson is asked whether his team are \xe2\x80\x9cwaxing\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwaning\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have to use that sort of analogy. We are in the same position. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got 10 games left, six games at home, and our home form has to be drastically improved. That\xe2\x80\x99s it.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou got any more questions you want to ask? Obviously not. Waxing or waning? Fucking hell. My arse \xe2\x80\xa6 Prick.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     '
