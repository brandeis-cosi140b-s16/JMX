b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho: Chelsea lost because we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t cope with the pressure'


b"<p>A frustrated Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho admitted his players \xe2\x80\x9ccould not cope with the pressure\xe2\x80\x9d as Chelsea were jettisoned from the Champions League on away goals by a Paris Saint-Germain team who had been forced to play for over 90 minutes with only 10 men.</p> <p>Zlatan Ibrahimovic\xe2\x80\x99s harsh dismissal just after the half-hour mark had appeared to thrust this tie in the hosts\xe2\x80\x99 favour but, despite leading twice, they were pegged back by headed goals from the returning David Luiz and Thiago Silva. Mourinho suggested that David Luiz may merit retrospective punishment for an elbow flung at Diego Costa \xe2\x80\x93 whose own evening ended with an angry confrontation with the officials and the PSG substitute, Yohan Cabaye \xe2\x80\x93 but could offer no explanation for his team\xe2\x80\x99s mentally fragile display.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPSG deserved to win,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen a team cannot defend two corners, and concedes twice, that team doesn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to win. When a team cannot cope with the pressure of being with one player more playing at home, and the stadium doesn\xe2\x80\x99t accept the team has to control the game and want them to go on and win it\xe2\x80\xa6 we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t cope with that pressure. For them it was easy: 10 men, defensive organisation, two lines of four, long balls for the counter-attack, waiting for free-kicks and corners. Mentally, for them, they had nothing to lose. They were experienced, they were good, and they deserved it.</p>     Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho said: \xe2\x80\x98The first feeling is we deserved to lose, analysis is the next step.\xe2\x80\x99 Photograph: Paul Gilham/Getty Images    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cClearly some of my players couldn\xe2\x80\x99t cope with that pressure. The individual performances were not good enough. When you concede twice from two corners, it\xe2\x80\x99s about a lack of concentration, a lack of responsibility to cope with the markers and the space you have to control. So we deserved to be punished with this draw. Sorry, this defeat.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He spoke only briefly with his crestfallen players in the dressing-room post-match and will spend the next 24 hours analysing why such fragility had reared. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to discuss why we lost in a calm way. I want to know what they felt on the pitch and try to draw conclusions. Our performance was not good enough. I told them it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the moment to speak with them about it all, but for me it was a surprise. And I\xe2\x80\x99m disappointed. But the first feeling is we deserved to lose. Analysis is the next step.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ibrahimovic was dismissed by the referee, Bj\xc3\xb6rn Kuipers, after a clash with Oscar with the referee brandishing the red card instantly \xe2\x80\x93 he flashed seven yellows in a fractious contest \xe2\x80\x93 while Chelsea players converged upon him apparently outraged by the Swede\xe2\x80\x99s challenge. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the red card happened the worst thing was the Chelsea players,\xe2\x80\x9d said the striker. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt there were 11 babies around me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI spoke with Zlatan after the game and he\xe2\x80\x99s always honest with me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cHe would tell me if it was a (justified) red card, and he was very disappointed. If he did nothing wrong, I hope they can minimise the mistake and let him play the quarter-final. But there was a clear penalty on Diego Costa \xe2\x80\x93 it is a waste of time and money to have officials by the side of the goal because normally they do nothing \xe2\x80\x93 and David Luiz\xe2\x80\x99s elbow I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see, I confess. Uefa gave him man of the match, though, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe they would do that if someone had made \xe2\x80\x98an aggression\xe2\x80\x99 like that.</p>     David Luiz celebrates at the end of the match as Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Diego Costa looks dejected.

But for us, no time to cry. We have a Premier League still to win. We must move forward.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The PSG manager, Laurent Blanc, suggested this result would serve as \xe2\x80\x9ca reference point going forward\xe2\x80\x9d as they seek to establish themselves as an elite force in the Champions League. A third successive quarter-final now awaits. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to be one of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s top clubs,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to sit at the top table, so I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy with this result. As for the incidents in the game, matches at the highest level are full of pressure and tension. Both sides put pressure on the opposition, and Chelsea did their fair share of that.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt had happened even before the match with their manager, exerting pressure on the referee. That\xe2\x80\x99s part of the mind games, and all fair and good. But if you take out these elements of unsporting behaviour, I think my team were better than Chelsea in every area of the pitch.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>"
