b'Manchester City v Aston Villa: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>Don\xe2\x80\x99t ask me how, but that game had five goals. After the early slapstick of Guzan\xe2\x80\x99s early blunder \xe2\x80\x93 and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be seeing plenty more of that, whoever and wherever you are \xe2\x80\x93 it didn\xe2\x80\x99t really deserve a thing more until things burst into life in the last 25 minutes. Kolarov\xe2\x80\x99s free-kick (what was the wall doing?) seemed to win it for City, before two similarly conceived but well-taken goals from Cleverley and Sanchez appeared to have gained Villa a precious and well-earned point. But no, they threw it away, defending shoddily from a corner and allowing Fernandinho to snatch it at the death. In fact, all five goals came from defensive muck-ups. Engaging finish but certainly low on quality.</p> <p>All of which leaves City in second, for now at least, and Villa 15th \xe2\x80\x93 three places and two points clear of the drop. You sense it was an opportunity lost for them against a generally sluggish City, and wonder what might have been if they had turned up at the outset. Oh Brad.</p> <p>Anyway, enough from me for today. Thanks for your morsels of contact, and enjoy the rest of your weekend!</p>     The final whistle brings dejection for the Villa players. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Reuters  '
