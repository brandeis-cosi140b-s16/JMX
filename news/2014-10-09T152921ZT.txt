b'The Fiver | A frothing Al Pacino screaming in your ear'


b'INCH BY INCH <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that Mr Roy probably isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to have to go all Any Given Sunday on his England players prior to their Euro 2016 qualifier against San Marino tonight. But imagine if he did? Hairs upright on the backs of necks! Tears rolling down cheeks! LL Cool J chilling in a pair of fresh shades, kissing the badge, ready to run his little heart out for Team Ingerland? Woof! Somebody get the Fiver to Wembley!</p> <p>Apologies. Even our blinkered eyes can see how silly it is to replace what might be a boring football narrative with a shiny NFL vision, but your only tea-timely email is struggling to get excited for tonight\xe2\x80\x99s 5-0-or-so victory. Which may or may not be a problem shared by the poor souls dragging themselves to north-west London and back tonight. Which may or may not be a problem shared by the England dressing room.</p> <p>How else can the team motivate themselves, then? Patriotism? A bit of Abba on the jukebox? Gary Neville running around with a wet towel? Nope, Mr Roy has a cunning plan: not losing. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be nice to go through this qualifying campaign unbeaten. If we get two good results, we\xe2\x80\x99ll set ourselves the target of winning all the games,\xe2\x80\x9d he roared, speaking as though the target of a football manager trying to win every game his team faces was a revelatory ambition. \xe2\x80\x9cI know we\xe2\x80\x99ve been spoilt in the past with massive crowds. It\xe2\x80\x99s incredible that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have 50,000 on Thursday night. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99ll be many crowds in qualifying games with that many, and very few when you have a low-rank team like San Marino.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>For Wayne Rooney, the motivation against San Marino\xe2\x80\x99s desperate defence is much clearer: hog every set-piece, shoot from long range and generally ignore the willing deep runners from midfield in his Supermarket Sweep-like attempt to claim football\xe2\x80\x99s biggest prize: overtaking Sir Bobby Charlton to become England\xe2\x80\x99s record goalscorer. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen clips of Jimmy Greaves and, of course, Bobby Charlton,\xe2\x80\x9d he mused. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s there for me to overtake them all. I feel I\xe2\x80\x99m capable of doing that. I\xe2\x80\x99d never have thought that when I came into this England team, I would be best goalscorer. It would be massive for me and make my family proud.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>At least it\xe2\x80\x99s good to know that there\xe2\x80\x99s a fire in someone\xe2\x80\x99s belly tonight. Thank God for Wayne. Without him, the Fiver doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know if it could face another 90 minutes of Andy Townsend, plus 22 bored men ambling round a half-empty stadium. In fact, without a frothing Al Pacino screaming in your ear, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard enough getting out of bed these days.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Scott Murray from 7.45pm BST for MBM coverage of England 5-0 San Marino, while Michael Butler will be manfully trawling the continent with his Euro 2016 clockwatch at the same time.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI have been in football 42 years and received many watches in my career. It is a classical present in football, so I did not need that watch. They say I received that watch. It is not true. I found that watch in a bag that was placed in our room. It\xe2\x80\x99s only after one week that I opened it, I saw there was a watch with plastic bracelet and the mark \xe2\x80\x98Parmigiano\xe2\x80\x99 (sic). For me Parmigiano is a cheese that you put on spaghetti. I thought it was a kind of Swatch \xe2\x80\xa6 Please never give me such presents again\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Fifa suit Michel D\xe2\x80\x99Hooghe did not like his \xc2\xa316,000 gift from the Brazilian FA.

And there\xe2\x80\x99s also a new app for iOS and Android.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t decide whether Cheaters, the adulterer-baiting reality show, or the quest for an open relationship inspired the concept of the 38th game (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver). With Cheaters, the suspicious partner (your Premier League club) goes in search of a new beau (\xe2\x80\x98fans\xe2\x80\x99 who live abroad), gets filmed doing so (Super $exy Sunday?) and the faithful partner (you, the mug) watches them get it on. It\xe2\x80\x99s cuckold bongo, but with more tigs. With the open relationship, there would need to be that conversation (eg: \xe2\x80\x98Babes, I met somebody on the internet but you can still come round my gaff every other Saturday\xe2\x80\x99)\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Grant McPhee.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think the Fiver missed a trick with the Skittles drink (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver). Every summer before attending any music festival, a couple of weeks in advance I would dissolve a few packets of Skittles into a litre of vodka. Oh the hilarity there used to be when I pulled out a bottle of warm, brown liquid, with lumps floating in it and a huge head of foam on the top. That hilarity never lasted long though. Drinking what basically amounts to a litre of raw vodka in an hour always ensured I was well rested for the entirety of that day. Looking back on those hedonistic summers now, I realise this was when my life was pre-Fiver. Life was much better pre-Fiver\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Olcan Shaw.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHaving read Wade Howland\xe2\x80\x99s letter about putting Roy Keane and Kevin Muscat in a Combi van (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters), and then later on reading about Paolo Di Canio applying for the Bolton job (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Bits and Bobs), a thought struck me. Since a Combi van has many seats, why not invite Paolo along? He and Roy are bound to get along, what with both of them being ex-Sunderland managers. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve still got seats left if the Fiver wanted to drag this on \xe2\x80\xa6 and on \xe2\x80\xa6 and on\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Paul Dixon.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMay I take Wade\xe2\x80\x99s fine idea and take it a step further? Can we arrange for Keane and Muscat to be joined by Rio Ferdinand, Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 and cricket\xe2\x80\x99s Kevin Pietersen in a version of the Saw series of movies?

Photograph: Stephen McCarthy/Sportsfile/Stephen McCarthy/Sportsfile/Corbis    <p>Roll up, roll up for Roy Keane\xe2\x80\x99s amazing publicity circus, in which we\xe2\x80\x99re happily complicit given it\xe2\x80\x99s international break. Speaking about Lord Ferg this afternoon, he beard-stroked: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you think what he made out of it, millions of pounds, statues. But to criticise people who have earned him success \xe2\x80\xa6 would I forgive him? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know \xe2\x80\xa6 Lots of stuff I let go, but eventually you have to go, enough is enough. You have to defend yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Meanwhile, FC Honka\xe2\x80\x99s Pablo Cou\xc3\xb1ago has taken a pop back at Keane after learning via Big Website that he had been heavily criticised in his former Ipswich manager\xe2\x80\x99s new book. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a very sad ending for a person that was so big as a player,\xe2\x80\x9d he miaowed. \xe2\x80\x9cAs I told him once, I think he is a complete mess as a football manager. As he has said in his book, he wanted to hit me, but behind his appearance there\xe2\x80\x99s a coward. I just hope he can find happiness in his life as, in my opinion, being that miserable must be very mentally draining.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Laurent Koscielny has joined Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s 769-strong injury list after being diagnosed with Achilles-ouch on France duty.</p> <p>Rayo Vallecano forward Lass Bangoura has returned to Spain over fears he could catch the Ebola virus while on international duty with Guinea. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a bit worried for my family because I might be attacked for this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI must talk with them to see what is happening.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>His Mr 15% Jorge Mendes insists the Real Madrid man has no interest in a return to Manchester United. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to respect the people who remember him but he\xe2\x80\x99s with Madrid to the death,\xe2\x80\x9d he trousered.</p> <p>And Gheorghe Hagi has vowed not to attend Romania\xe2\x80\x99s international matches in solidarity with Gica Popescu, who was jailed for tax evasion and money laundering in March. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll only watch them on TV as a form of protest,\xe2\x80\x9d he parped half-heartedly.</p> RECOMMENDED VIEWING <p>This week\xe2\x80\x99s Classic YouTube features Juan Rom\xc3\xa1n Riquelme\xe2\x80\x99s top 55 goals, some dynamite in Denmark and the dramatic final seconds of the Icelandic football season.</p> STILL WANT MORE?
