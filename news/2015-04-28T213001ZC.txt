b'Chelsea creating a new generation of winners, says Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho believes a new core of experienced players is emerging at Chelsea, taking over from such as the departed Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole, though the manager insists he provides the only true leadership at Stamford Bridge.</p> <p>The champions-elect travel to Leicester City on Wednesday seeking to move 13 points clear at the top and to within one win of their first title in five years. Mourinho has relied on a relatively small pool of players in establishing that lead, with 11 of his squad having started at least 23 Premier League matches this season and three \xe2\x80\x93John Terry, Branislav Ivanovic and Eden Hazard \xe2\x80\x93 ever-presents.</p> <p>Terry\xe2\x80\x99s display in the goalless draw at Arsenal on Sunday was rated his \xe2\x80\x9cbest ever\xe2\x80\x9d by Mourinho, with the visitors ending with Didier Drogba on the pitch and Mikel John Obi and Petr Cech included on the bench. Cech could start at Leicester because Thibaut Courtois has a slight hip problem.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFor those older guys it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to belong to two different generations,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we are champions this season then Petr, Didier, John and Mikel will have belonged to two generations of title winners. The same as me. It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to belong to the history of a club in different moments, so it\xe2\x80\x99s good for these older guys.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re all very experienced, and these guys are special players but we have others coming through. Ivanovic is experienced. [C\xc3\xa9sar] Azpilicueta is gaining experience. Hazard is here now for three years. [Nemanja] Matic is getting experience. This is a natural process, and the years count for everyone. Ruben Loftus-Cheek is 19 now and has just arrived. But, in five years\xe2\x80\x99 time, he will be 24 and experienced. Chelsea lost, at the end of last year, what I consider, for sure, to be one of the five most important players in the history of Chelsea FC: Frank Lampard.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe lost that player but life goes on. You have to think about the future and to build, and you have to go with that. In Frank Lampard, Chelsea lost a match-winner with a number of goals he scored, a big character, a player without injuries who played every game, a player who beat every record in the Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 playing time, number of goals, goals from midfield \xe2\x80\x93 an absolutely amazing player. We lost him but life goes on.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Lampard, like Cech, Drogba and Terry, had been a member of a group of players whose influence was established during Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s first tenure at the club, and who continued to exert considerable sway under his successors.</p> <p>While Terry, in particular, remains an icon, Mourinho said the power base within the dressing room lies with him. \xe2\x80\x9cChelsea leadership is my leadership. For good and for bad. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the players\xe2\x80\x99 leadership \xe2\x80\x93 even on the pitch.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho will win his third Premier League title for Chelsea, quite possibly on Sunday, though his club\xe2\x80\x99s ability to dominate domestically \xe2\x80\x93 as his first title winning team at Stamford Bridge arguably did \xe2\x80\x93 thereafter will be severely tested in what he considers to be a far more competitive environment. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s even more difficult to dominate than before,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you speak about domination when everyone knows what will happen next summer?</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cArsenal have a phenomenal squad. Thierry Henry said they need four top-class players but give to Arsenal four top-class players and I think they will again be The Invincibles. Manchester United have a phenomenal squad, including the most expensive player in the history of the Premier League, \xc3\x81ngel Di Mar\xc3\xada, who is not even playing. That shows the quality of the squad. They are a club where financial fair play doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make a big difference and they will invest hugely again in the summer.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cCity have done phenomenally well, winning two titles in three years and people say they will invest hugely again. Liverpool can be fighting for the title, too. So, next year, it will be even more difficult for everyone than this year. At this moment, it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult in the Premier League for a team to be dominant. This is not Germany with Bayern Munich. This is not Switzerland with Basel. Not Scotland with Celtic. It\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
