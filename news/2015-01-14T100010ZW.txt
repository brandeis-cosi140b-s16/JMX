b'<p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy team, Bristol City, are on the verge of a trip to Wembley for the Johnstone\xe2\x80\x99s Paint Trophy final this season,\xe2\x80\x9d Will Jones writes. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m pleased because, when we got relegated, one of my consolations was that getting to Wembley seems to be easier in the lower divisions. Given this, and given that most Premier League/Championship clubs have been there for a final at some stage in their existence, I wondered whether any of the 92 league teams have never played at Wembley? And a second question \xe2\x80\x93 which side is currently enduring the longest wait since their most recent appearance?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Two questions, Will? A bit cheeky. But we\xe2\x80\x99ll let it ride. You\xe2\x80\x99ve never been to Wembley, after all, it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable that you\xe2\x80\x99re in an excitable mood at the moment.</p> <p>And here\xe2\x80\x99s a straightforward answer to your first question: only four current Football League clubs have never made it to Wembley and they are Accrington Stanley, Crawley Town, Hartlepool United and Walsall. But that might change soon, because Walsall are on the verge of making their first visit to the home of English football this season, having won the first leg of their Johnstone\xe2\x80\x99s Paint Trophy Northern Area semi-final 2-0 away at Preston North End. Will\xe2\x80\x99s Bristol City are their likely opponents in the final, assuming that they can push home a 4-2 advantage from the first leg of their semi against Gillingham.</p> <p>As for those who have been to Wembley already, the club who have had to wait the longest for another appearance are Fulham. Their last trip there was in 1975 when they were beaten 2-0 by West Ham United in the FA Cup final.</p> THREE UNITEDS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhile shooting the proverbial, a mate of mine raised an interesting point (28 November 2014),\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Daniel Jackson last month. \xe2\x80\x9cAs of today, the Premier League table reads: 4) Manchester United; 5) Newcastle United; 6) West Ham United. Is this the highest that all three \xe2\x80\x98Uniteds\xe2\x80\x99 have sat at any given time? Has there been another occasion were all three were positioned in the top six?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>And help is at hand at long last, from Tom Thorby. \xe2\x80\x9cThe state of the positions of Manchester, West Ham and Newcastle Uniteds of 4th, 5th and 6th on 28 November 2014 gives an average position of 5,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom says. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, on 1 December 1985, the positions of the sides were an average of 4.33 with Manchester United 1st, West Ham 3rd and Newcastle 9th. This was the best average position of the season as Liverpool and Everton eventually finished 1st and 2nd, pushing the Uniteds\xe2\x80\x99 average down to 6. I cannot find a higher average than 4.33 for these three sides over the seasons.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn terms of lowest positional average in the top division, in 1977-78 the league finished with Manchester United 10th and West Ham and Newcastle both relegated, finishing 21st and 22nd, giving an average position of 17, and the 1974 season where Manchester United were relegated in 21st, Newcastle finished in 15th and West Ham 18th.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhile the question is referring to West Ham United, if they are replaced by Leeds United then on 18 December 1993 there were three Uniteds in the top 6 as Manchester were 1st, Newcastle 2nd and Leeds 4th. This gives an average position of 2.33. At the end of the 1993-94 season, Manchester United finished 1st, Newcastle United 3rd and Leeds United 5th, giving an average of 3 which appears to be the highest average of any Uniteds in the English top division.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> LOWEST SCORING HIGHEST SCORERS (2) <p>Last week\xe2\x80\x99s edition looked at the lowest number of goals scored by the top goalscorer in a league-winning side. But there\xe2\x80\x99s more \xe2\x80\xa6</p> <p>Andrew Amor has one more. Over to you, Andrew: \xe2\x80\x9cCardiff City won the Championship in 2013 despite our leading goalscorers, Peter Whittingham, Heider Helguson and Aron Gunnarsson, scoring only eight league goals each,\xe2\x80\x9d he notes. \xe2\x80\x9cDespite this we still finished with the league\xe2\x80\x99s joint-best goal difference and were third top scorers, proving that double-digit strikers are overrated.\xe2\x80\x9d Presumably that\xe2\x80\x99s Adam Le Fondre\xe2\x80\x99s excuse now.</p> KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI vaguely remember waking up on Boxing Day morning a couple of years ago (with a massive hangover) and seeing a caption on Football Focus with an old list of Boxing Day fixtures and an awful lot of goals. Was it something to do with the DTs or did this really happen?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ken Davro in 2000.</p> <p>We\xe2\x80\x99re not doctors, so our lawyers have advised us to make no comment about the floating spots in front of your eyes. But we can help you with the Boxing Day thing. On 26 December 1963, an amazing 66 goals were scored in the old First Division, leaving some teams wishing there had been a repeat of the previous season\xe2\x80\x99s Big Freeze (which had wiped out nearly all the football between Boxing Day and March). Here are the classifieds:</p>  <p>Blackpool 1-5 ChelseaBurnley 6-1 Man UtdFulham 10-1 IpswichLeicester 2-0 EvertonLiverpool 6-1 StokeNottm Forest 3-3 Sheff UtdWBA 4-4 TottenhamSheff Wed 3-0 BoltonWolves 3-3 Aston VillaWest Ham 2-8 Blackburn</p>  <p>If that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t weird enough, the results two days later \xe2\x80\x93 when many of the teams played the \xe2\x80\x9creturn leg\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 beggar belief. West Ham, who had lost 8-2 at home to Blackburn, won 3-1 at Ewood Park. Manchester United, fresh from a 6-1 thrashing at Burnley, turned the tables at Old Trafford with a 5-1 win. And poor Ipswich, who had clearly been on the Christmas Day pop, avenged their 10-1 defeat by Fulham with a 4-2 victory over the Cottagers at Portman Road. Much good the two points did them, mind you: they finished bottom.</p> CAN YOU HELP? <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the longest period for which only one player has scored for a club?\xe2\x80\x9d muses Michael Brown.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRecently, Burnley made all three substitutions against Newcastle in the first 37 minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d observes Peter Goldstein. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the record for the earliest three substitutions?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhich team has successfully negotiated the most number of rounds on a single run in the FA Cup, or any cup competition,\xe2\x80\x9d wonders Chris Lloyd.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWho holds the record for the most unused substitute appearances in the Premier League?\xe2\x80\x9d tweets John Briggs.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf we define the promotion score of a manager as (# of promotions) minus (# of relegations), who has the highest promotion score?\xe2\x80\x9d muses Taufiq Akbari Utomo.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your questions and answers to the lovely people at knowledge@theguardian.com.</p>'
