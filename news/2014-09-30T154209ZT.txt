b'The Fiver | As if it was the brainchild of George Osborne'


b'ANOTHER BIG CUP NIGHT <p>Round two of the ever-exciting group stages of Big Cup is upon us. Yawn! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeawwwwwwwwww-un! Yawn. Zzzzz. Talk to the hand. Not interested. The Fiver is not interested. The Fiver is bored. The Fiver will be watching people get emotional about baking cakes on the other channel instead and it will be fun. Much more fun than whatever\xe2\x80\x99s going on in a bloated tournament that, as if it was the brainchild of George Osborne, is designed to keep the rich rich and kill competitiveness in football and which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get going until the knock-outs start NEXT YEAR. Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho is back in Portugal? Manchester City are taking on Serie A leaders Roma, who arrive in England with Arsenal legends Ashley Cole and Gervinho in tow? Struggling French minnows PSG hope to cause a shock against Barcelona? Well, whoop-dee-d \xe2\x80\xa6 Hang on. Actually that\xe2\x80\x99s all quite interesting. Well. Maybe the bake-off will have to wait.</p> <p>So, Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s back in Portugal \xe2\x80\x93 what will he get up to next? \xe2\x80\x93 and presumably he\xe2\x80\x99s hoping that Chelsea won\xe2\x80\x99t be given too stressful a work-out by Sporting Lisbon, given that they won\xe2\x80\x99t want to waste too much energy ahead of Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 24-0 thrashing of Arsenal (Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas with the lot). But Mourinho does have a worry over Big Bad Diego Costa\xe2\x80\x99s flimsy little hamstrings. \xe2\x80\x9cNext week, he goes to the national team. And I have the feeling that, with the national team, they will make no consideration for the fact he\xe2\x80\x99s in trouble,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho wept. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, in Lisbon, he plays. And, hopefully, he plays Sunday again against Arsenal. There is a risk, yes. But we accept that risk, he plays and, hopefully, everything goes well.\xe2\x80\x9d You have to feel Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s pain. If only he had some ridiculous financial advantage that would have allowed him to sign two top international strikers as cover for Costa \xe2\x80\xa6</p> <p>Meanwhile Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s old chums Barcelona are in France, waiting to take on PSG, where concern is growing after, er, an unbeaten start to the season which has left them a whole five (5) points off the pace after eight (8) matches. More of that dismal form will earn Laurent Blanc a one-way ticket to the guillotine, where PSG\xe2\x80\x99s owners will pretend they can\xe2\x80\x99t hear him shouting \xe2\x80\x9cBUT YOU IDIOTS BLEW THE ENTIRE TRANSFER BUDGET ON DAVID LUIZ AND FORGOT TO LEAVE ENOUGH FOR US TO SIGN ANGEL DI MARIA!\xe2\x80\x9d Clunk!</p> <p>And then there\xe2\x80\x99s City, brave City, hoping to make amends against Roma after a 1-0 thrashing by Bayern Munich a fortnight ago, with Heroic Hartdog expected to be be back in goal for the visit of Rudi Garcia\xe2\x80\x99s side after being dropped for Wi11y \xe2\x80\x9cWi11y\xe2\x80\x9d Caballero against Hull City. It\xe2\x80\x99s a game that City dare not lose, even though they do still give the impression that they are not fully comfortable in their Big Cup surroundings yet. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we can fight for the Premier League title and get further in [Big Cup], that would be progress,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel Pellegrini roared, doing his very best to remind the Fiver that it\xe2\x80\x99s not too late to switch back to the cake-off.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>A triple-header!

They are: David Daly (senior director at Nike), Huw Jennings (manager of the Fulham Academy), Danny Murphy (former Fulham captain), Brian McBride (former Fulham captain) and Niall Quinn (um \xe2\x80\xa6). Obviously. Murphy will presumably be recommending himself, while other candidates are likely to include Kit Symons, Jim Carrey, James Spader and that bloke from Everybody Loves Raymond.
