b'Bradford\xe2\x80\x99s Mark Lawn savours FA Cup run at a harrowing time for his family'


b'<p>Bradford City take on Reading in the FA Cup quarter-finals on Saturday with the aim of reaching the last four of the competition for the first time in 104 years. Just as two seasons ago, when the Bantams reached the Capital One Cup final, they are the nation\xe2\x80\x99s underdogs and a wonderful reminder of the enduring romance of cup competitions in this cash-soaked Premier League age.</p> <p>Bradford have already eliminated Chelsea and Sunderland from the competition, the former after a memorable 4-2 victory at Stamford Bridge. Following that most giant of all giantkillings the club\xe2\x80\x99s ebullient co-chairman, Mark Lawn, made a memorable appearance on Match of the Day, epitomising the joy of supporters, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cJust wait until you see the fourth goal, you\xe2\x80\x99d think we were Chelsea.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Yet real life takes over for the instantly likeable Lawn when the cameras and lights go off. Bradford\xe2\x80\x99s cup run is occurring at the same time as the 54-year-old deals bravely with a harrowing time for his family.</p> <p>Asked how he celebrated the triumph over Chelsea, Lawn tells the Guardian: \xe2\x80\x9cMy wife\xe2\x80\x99s terminally ill. So unfortunately after the Chelsea game it was all too much for her. I had to take her back to the hotel room, so my celebrations were a room service beef burger and a bottle of Corona while I watched Match of the Day.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Lawn laughs softly at the memory, an illustration of how this lifelong fan, whose first match was a 3-0 win over Southport in 1964, is retaining perspective despite a desperately trying period for him, his wife, Yvonne, and their five children.</p> <p>Lawn\xe2\x80\x99s generosity of spirit, which stretches to helping even \xe2\x80\x9caggressive\xe2\x80\x9d fans who want a ticket for Reading\xe2\x80\x99s visit, is illustrated when, of Yvonne\xe2\x80\x99s illness, he says: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been fighting cancer for about two and a half years but it became terminal in May of last year. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a bastard of a disease \xe2\x80\x93 it started with bowel cancer and it\xe2\x80\x99s spread. If she\xe2\x80\x99d have gone [to the doctor] earlier they could\xe2\x80\x99ve saved this.</p> <p>He adds that going public about Yvonne\xe2\x80\x99s illness would be worth it if it managed to save one person. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re passing blood get to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s, they can save your life.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cGet there early, don\xe2\x80\x99t be scared. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a scare and I went in within three days. I got tested, that\xe2\x80\x99s what you need to do. Luckily I\xe2\x80\x99m OK.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: FA Cup quarter-finals: breaking down each of the last-eight ties </p>   <p>His club is fine too and again bringing a smile to the city\xe2\x80\x99s inhabitants at a time when it is slowly emerging from a bleak decade for the local economy.</p> <p>The home ground, Valley Parade, is situated off Manningham Road, a run-down thoroughfare. On the five-minute walk from the stadium to the city centre there are a couple of sex shops, some dilapidated store fronts, a closed-down Grecian-style building with faded pink paint called the Town and Country Club, and a large Jobcentre.</p> <p>In 2006 a Westfield project to build a new high-end shopping complex caused the demolition of Forster Square and a number of buildings on Broadway, the city centre\xe2\x80\x99s main street. \xe2\x80\x9cWe get left out a little bit being so close to Leeds,\xe2\x80\x9d Lawn says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe socio-economics of it, all the government money seems to go there, and the businesses seem to go into Leeds. We\xe2\x80\x99re like a poor neighbour so it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help we haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a city centre since Westfield bought the site and didn\xe2\x80\x99t rebuild it. But hopefully that\xe2\x80\x99s going to change \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s the focal point of the whole town.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Lord Mayor, Mike Gibbons, who is a Conservative councillor, confirms the project is finally due to open as the city experiences a welcome upturn in fortunes. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a renewed confidence and optimism \xe2\x80\x93 Bradford is moving forward,\xe2\x80\x9d he says and points to the renamed Westfield complex. \xe2\x80\x9cThe new Broadway shopping centre is to open later in the year, both the university and college have had major developments, there is a new brewery, and the central city park areas remains ever popular.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBusinesses are looking to invest in Bradford for the first time in many years. And the whole Bradford City success story complements that and is giving people a wonderful feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Two years ago Phil Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s then League Two side famously became the first bottom tier club to play in a major Wembley final when they watched the Capital One Cup showpiece, knocking out three Premier League teams \xe2\x80\x93 Wigan Athletic, Arsenal and Aston Villa \xe2\x80\x93 en route.</p> <p>While Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s men lost 5-0 to Swansea City that day, they were back at Wembley in May for the division\xe2\x80\x99s play-off final and defeated Northampton Town to claim promotion to League One.</p> <p>That 2012-13 campaign was a first success since the Bantams\xe2\x80\x99 two years in the Premier League, between 1999 and 2001, which brought the club into the national spotlight after promotion under Paul Jewell. What followed were dark days that saw the club twice being forced into administration \xe2\x80\x93 at the end of the 2000-01 season after relegation to the old First Division, and two years later, by which time Bradford were in the third tier.</p> <p>Lawn became joint chairman in 2007 but by the end of that season Bradford had suffered their third demotion in six years and were playing in the bottom division for the first time since the 1980s.</p> <p>Bradford were founded in 1903, and only eight years later Jimmy Speirs gave the club their finest moment to date, his strike in the 1911 FA Cup final replay at Old Trafford \xe2\x80\x93 following a goalless draw at Crystal Palace \xe2\x80\x93 winning the Bantams their sole major trophy.</p>     Photographs of members of the 1911 Bradford FA Cup-winning team. Photograph: Gary Calton    <p>This season\xe2\x80\x99s exploits add another memorable chapter to the Bradford cup tradition. This Cinderella story began with a 2-1 defeat of FC Halifax Town back on 9 November in the first round and since then Dartford have been defeated 4-1, Millwall (4-0 in a replay after a 3-3 draw), Chelsea on that scarcely believable day when Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s team went 2-0 up, and Sunderland, whose 2-0 defeat hardly felt a shock given that previous result.</p> <p>Stuart McCall, who played for the Bantams in those Premier League seasons and had a spell as their permanent manager from 2007 to 2010 after a caretaker stint in 2000, says: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Chelsea game will go down as the best result regardless of what happens between now and the end of the season. When they scored just before half-time I thought: \xe2\x80\x98Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that great for all the 6,000 fans that are down there. At least they can cheer a goal.\xe2\x80\x99</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNobody could imagine what could happen after that. Then to knock Sunderland out \xe2\x80\x93 nobody was actually surprised, because the Cup record has been superb. In the last couple of weeks Reading\xe2\x80\x99s results have dipped. Bradford might even go into this game as favourites. The pitch isn\xe2\x80\x99t in great condition, there\xe2\x80\x99ll be almost a full house there, the atmosphere\xe2\x80\x99s terrific, they\xe2\x80\x99ve done it many times before: it\xe2\x80\x99s all about belief.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>McCall believes Reading will not fancy the trip. \xe2\x80\x9cSunderland were the same. The pitch at the moment is not in the greatest condition. But it\xe2\x80\x99s unfair on Bradford to say [they can\xe2\x80\x99t play] even though they\xe2\x80\x99ve got Jon Stead and James Hanson up front,\xe2\x80\x9d he says of strikers who are 6ft 3in and 6ft 4in respectively. \xe2\x80\x9cReading will know the cup tradition of Bradford over the years. It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly one of the hardest ties they could\xe2\x80\x99ve got, that\xe2\x80\x99s for sure.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As Gibbons adds: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a tremendous buzz and excitement looking forward to the game. They\xe2\x80\x99ve done so very well and shown they can beat anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>And, at last, the invigorating Bradford FA Cup show is to be screened live on television. The BBC ignored the ties with Chelsea and Sunderland but BT Sport are showing the quarter-final with Reading free to air. \xe2\x80\x9cThe people at the top of the BBC don\xe2\x80\x99t understand football,\xe2\x80\x9d says Lawn.</p> <p>Interest in tickets has naturally been immense, and Lawn\xe2\x80\x99s determination to ensure everyone can attend the quarter-final moved him to take calls from supporters at the club last week. Lawn admits he and the co-chairman, Julian Rhodes, misjudged demand for the tie after allowing season ticket holders as many seats as they wanted. The cost is only \xc2\xa35, \xc2\xa310 or \xc2\xa315 and \xe2\x80\x9csome of our fans have abused it, so we\xe2\x80\x99re struggling\xe2\x80\x9d, he says. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we are going to try our best to make sure every season ticket holder who wants to be there can.</p>     Bradford City want to ensure as many of their fans as possible can see the FA Cup tie against Reading. Photograph: Gary Calton    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOne came and said: \xe2\x80\x98I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a ticket. I said: \xe2\x80\x98Why? The guy who queued overnight got a ticket, so should I say to him he can\xe2\x80\x99t have a ticket? But because you came down Monday and we\xe2\x80\x99d sold out, you can?\xe2\x80\x99</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI did manage to get him one. He was very aggressive. But I said: \xe2\x80\x98Look, do you think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to help you if you\xe2\x80\x99re aggressive toward me?\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be honest, my other businesses slide even though that\xe2\x80\x99s the only way we get any money. We don\xe2\x80\x99t pull any income out of Bradford, Julian and myself.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Lawn only broke off from the buildup to the quarter-final when his wife\xe2\x80\x99s condition took a distressing turn for the worse. \xe2\x80\x9cShe got rushed into hospital on Friday so it\xe2\x80\x99s a difficult sort of thing \xe2\x80\x93 you just get on don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is still in there \xe2\x80\x93 but we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping to get her out for Saturday.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Bradford\xe2\x80\x99s cup heroics <p>Oct 2012 Capital One Cup 4th round</p> <p>Wigan 0-0 Bradford City City win 4-2 on pens</p> <p>City defended heroically to take the game to penalties. While the visitors showed no nerves, Shaun Maloney fired over from the spot before Matt Duke saved Jordi G\xc3\xb3mez\xe2\x80\x99s effort.</p> <p>Dec 2012 Capital One Cup quarter-final</p> <p>Bradford City 1-1 Arsenal City win 3-2 on pens</p> <p>Thomas Vermaelen headed Arsenal a lifeline with two minutes remaining after Garry Thompson had given City a deserved lead. Yet it was the Gunners captain who missed the crucial spot kick with Bradford becoming the first bottom tier side to reach the semi-finals of the competition.</p> <p>Jan 2013 Capital One Cup semi-final</p> <p>Bradford City 3-1 Aston Villa</p> <p>Phil Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s side may have been 60 places lower than their Premier League opponents, but the Bantams terrorised them in the air to take a well-deserved first leg advantage. Villa pegged them back in the return match but could only register a 2-1 win as Bradford made it to Wembley where they lost 5-0 to Swansea.</p> <p>Jan 2015 FA Cup 3rd round</p> <p>Chelsea 2-4 Bradford City</p> <p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho had said it \xe2\x80\x9cwould be a disgrace\xe2\x80\x9d if the Premier League leaders lost at home. 2-0 up, the Blues were seemingly coasting until an amazing comeback including two goals in the last eight minutes produced arguably the biggest FA Cup shock of all time.</p> <p>Feb 2015 FA Cup 4th round</p> <p>Bradford City 2-0 Sunderland</p> <p>John O\xe2\x80\x99Shea\xe2\x80\x99s own goal from Billy Clarke\xe2\x80\x99s bobbling shot gave the League One the perfect start after just three minutes, before substitute Jon Stead capped a fine team display to earn Bradford their first FA Cup quarter-final appearance since 1976.</p>'
