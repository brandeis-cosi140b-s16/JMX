b'Sam Allardyce\xe2\x80\x99s shock theory busted following West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s loss to West Brom'


b'<p>Sam Allardyce has a theory about why so many Premier League teams have already fallen by the wayside in the FA Cup, supposedly leaving the competition wide open for teams of the stature of West Ham and West Bromwich Albion to make a bid for Wembley.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHas anyone identified why there were so many shocks in the third round this year?\xe2\x80\x9d the West Ham manager asked after blaming exhaustion for his side\xe2\x80\x99s 4-0 collapse at the Hawthorns. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is because all the Premier League teams had to play on the Thursday \xe2\x80\x93 New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day \xe2\x80\x93 and the Football League teams were all off. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I thought there were so many shocks. While we were still in it we did have a good chance but unfortunately we copped it this time. Our injury list and run of fixtures caught up with us \xe2\x80\x93 the players were dead on their feet.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Nice try Sam, but a fairly fundamental flaw in the initial logic. There were no shocks in this year\xe2\x80\x99s third round. Only one Premier League side, struggling Queens Park Rangers, went out to lower league opposition. All the shocks came in the fourth round, when Chelsea, Manchester City, Southampton and Spurs were all beaten at home, though none of them could claim Thursday fixtures as an excuse.</p> <p>Allardyce\xe2\x80\x99s argument about more recent fixtures does not quite stack up either. West Ham played Sunday and Wednesday, against Manchester United and Southampton, but so did West Brom, away at Burnley and home to Swansea. The early Saturday kick-off was obviously the same for both sides, so if Allardyce was really claiming his side\xe2\x80\x99s lethargy was due to a late kick-off the previous Sunday or having a man sent off at St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s it is no wonder the impressive West Ham support vented their fury at what seemed an unnecessarily limp display. Around 6,500 Irons fans travelled to the Midlands, outsang the home crowd for most of the match, then began to leave 20 minutes before the end after seeing four goals conceded and Morgan Amalfitano sent off for shoving Chris Brunt in the face.</p> <p>If the away support sensed capitulation early on \xe2\x80\x93 when a weak challenge by Aaron Cresswell allowed Craig Dawson to set up Brown Ideye for the first of his two goals \xe2\x80\x93 they were sure of it when Allardyce withdrew Diafra Sakho and Alex Song after going three down. There was little anyone could do about the marvellous James Morrison strike that put the Baggies two up at the interval, but the defending for Ideye\xe2\x80\x99s second was woeful and Allardyce was subjected to highly personal abuse from his own fans. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to be disappointed by that,\xe2\x80\x9d the West Ham manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not professional.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>A clean strike by Saido Berahino completed the rout and left Tony Pulis \xe2\x80\x93 not for the first time \xe2\x80\x93 looking like a manager who can breathe life into almost any pallid looking corpse. If West Brom carry on like this, with Brunt a revelation at full-back and Morrison and Craig Gardner killing West Ham with their distribution and eye for a strike, there will be more than a few Aston Villa fans wondering why the club persevered with Paul Lambert until Pulis was unavailable. Pulis himself, typically, will not be getting carried away by the FA Cup until a few more league points have been gathered to nudge the club towards the safety of mid-table. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to look forward to the next round until I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the draw,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s crucial. One year at Stoke we did brilliant to reach the quarter-finals and we pulled Chelsea away. Unbelievably difficult. In the Cup you need a slice of luck, a home game or a good draw, and then you have a chance. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t got the biggest squad, so we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be lucky.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Man of the match Brown Ideye (West Bromwich Albion)</p>'
