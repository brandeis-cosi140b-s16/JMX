b'Champions League draw: Manchester City to play Barcelona in last 16'


b'<p>Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s reward for securing progress from their Champions League group is another meeting with Barcelona, who beat them last season, also in the knockout phase. City\xe2\x80\x99s sporting director, Txiki Begiristain, described the draw, made on Monday, as \xe2\x80\x9cunbelievable\xe2\x80\x9d. The teams met at the same, last-16 stage last season, Bar\xc3\xa7a prevailing 4-1 on aggregate.</p> <p>Another of the English qualifiers, Chelsea, were also drawn against familiar opponents. The Premier League leaders have been paired with Paris Saint-Germain, whom they overcame in last season\xe2\x80\x99s quarter-finals. The Arsenal manager, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger, will face his former club Monaco in what appears the most favourable of the ties awaiting English clubs.</p> <p>Whereas Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho and Wenger had expressed a wish before draw in Nyon to meet those respective opponents from Ligue 1 City face the daunting prospect of taking on Barcelona again. They and their frontline of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez are due at the Etihad Stadium for the first leg on 24 February. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is unbelievable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Begiristain, a former Barcelona player and director. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t need to talk because, every time, it is the same: Bayern Munich, AS Roma, CSKA Moscow in the group stage, and now Barcelona, who we also drew last season.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe have plenty of confidence, though, because of beating Bayern, and Roma away, and we have players to recover and come back so we will arrive in a good moment. We have improved our squad since last season, we are more solid and stronger at the back. We have more confidence for this game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Manuel Pellegrini, who took unfancied Villarreal to the semi-finals of this competition in 2006 and M\xc3\xa1laga to the last eight, will hope Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero and Vincent Kompany have fully recovered from recent injuries to feature against Luis Enrique\xe2\x80\x99s side, though Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 will miss the first leg in Manchester as he serves the third game of his ban for a dismissal against CSKA. The Bar\xc3\xa7a sporting vice-president, Jordi Mestre, said the tie would be \xe2\x80\x9ca very hard match as Manchester City are a very tough team to beat\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>PSG, still second by a point in France despite suffering their first league defeat of the season at the weekend, will pose another stern test for Chelsea despite Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s apparent eagerness to confront the club bankrolled by Qatar Sports Investments. The Portuguese, whose team play Derby County on Tuesday in the quarter-finals of the Capital One Cup, had suggested his players would benefit from a game against high-calibre opposition when the competition resumes in February. \xe2\x80\x9cI prefer a team that really motivates the boys so, if I could choose, I\xe2\x80\x99d say Paris,\xe2\x80\x9d he said on Saturday. \xe2\x80\x9cBut also to make it easy for everybody \xe2\x80\x93 easy for us to travel and easier for the fans to travel.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The west London club will be reunited with their former centre-half, David Luiz, at Parc des Princes on 17 February. The Brazilian left Stamford Bridge for a fee of around \xc2\xa350m last summer. The defender was in the Chelsea team beaten 3-1 in Paris in last year\xe2\x80\x99s quarter-final first leg, scoring an own goal, but Chelsea won 2-0 in the return game, with a decisive 87th\xe2\x80\x91minute strike from Demba Ba, to progress on the away goals rule. The PSG president, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, welcomed the chance for revenge and suggested he was \xe2\x80\x9cvery confident\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cWe learned a lot from the experience last year,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we will be working hard to make sure there is a different outcome this time round.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Despite the prospect of facing Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Edinson Cavani and Ezequiel Lavezzi, who was so impressive in last season\xe2\x80\x99s tie, there is conviction at Chelsea that they are better equipped to triumph in the Champions League this season, having reached last season\xe2\x80\x99s semi-finals. \xe2\x80\x9cLast year we were close and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the team playing at such a high level as we do this season, so we can dream we will do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cBut let\xe2\x80\x99s see if the sharks let us because there are a few sharks in the ocean.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Wenger will take Arsenal to Monaco, where he spent seven years as manager before leaving in 1994 having claimed one French league title and a French Cup and reached the Cup Winners\xe2\x80\x99 Cup final, in 1992. Monaco currently languish sixth in Ligue 1, though they beat Marseille, the leaders, on Sunday and scored only four times to top Group C. The draw was a relative relief for Arsenal given they played, and were eliminated by, Bayern Munich at this stage in the last two seasons. Arsenal have never met Monaco in a competitive fixture, though Radamel Falcao scored the only goal in a game at the pre-season Emirates Cup last summer.</p> <p>The French club will be without their influential midfielder J\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9my Toulalan for the first leg in London through suspension and the Monaco manager, Leonardo Jardim, is realistic about his side\xe2\x80\x99s prospects. \xe2\x80\x9cArsenal are a very good team,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are used to this type of game and for that reason they are favourites in my eyes. They have lots of players of quality, like Olivier Giroud and Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez. But we\xe2\x80\x99ll play to win as always.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In the other ties Real Madrid will play Roberto Di Matteo\xe2\x80\x99s Schalke while Bayern Munich face Shakhtar Donetsk. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are certainly favourites against Shakhtar,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bayern chairman, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we will go there with great respect in these games. This is definitely a new experience for us.\xe2\x80\x9d Basel, who knocked Liverpool out at the group stage, play Porto, Juventus will take on Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen face Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid, last season\xe2\x80\x99s runners-up.</p> The last-16 draw in full <p>PSG v Chelsea</p> <p>Manchester City v Barcelona</p> <p>Bayer Leverkusen v Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid</p> <p>Juventus v Borussia Dortmund</p> <p>Schalke v Real Madrid</p> <p>Shakhtar Donetsk v Bayern Munich</p> <p>Arsenal v Monaco</p> <p>Basel v Porto</p>'
