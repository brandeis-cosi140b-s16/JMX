b'Newcastle United v Sunderland: match preview'


b'<p>Alan Pardew is desperate to avoid becoming the first Newcastle manager to lose four straight derbies to Sunderland. He could do without having his novice third-choice goalkeeper, Jak Alnwick, protecting his defence. Not to mention being up against Gus Poyet. The Uruguayan was labelled \xe2\x80\x9ca scourge of this club\xe2\x80\x9d by Sir Bobby Robson when, as a Chelsea and Spurs player, he was prone to scoring against the Tynesiders. Key subplots include the likely midfield duel between Moussa Sissoko and Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s Lee Cattermole and the performance of Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s Jack Colback against his former employers.
