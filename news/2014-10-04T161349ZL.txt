b'Leicester City 2-2 Burnley | Premier League match report'


b'<p>It will not just be victories over Manchester United, however fantastic they are, upon which Leicester City\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League future will be determined but their ability to see off potential relegation rivals, so conceding an equaliser six minutes into stoppage time to Burnley could be a bitter blow.</p> <p>Nigel Pearson, the Leicester manager, was rather dismissive of Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s approach, after the two sides automatically promoted from the Championship ultimately cancelled each other out. But he was pleased his team had at least dominated the game. However, dropping so deep that they gave Burnley the late opportunity to win and convert a free-kick, expertly dispatched by Ross Wallace, after Michael Kightly had ended a club record goal drought of 10 hours and 55 minutes to score a first equaliser, smacked of carelessness.</p> <p>Leicester have enjoyed a superb start to the season, peaking with that memorable 5-3 triumph over United last time out here, where they have lost once in 19 games, but beating and keeping above teams such as Burnley will be paramount in their bid to stay up.</p> <p>Pearson has his team playing with a zest and dynamism that merited the lead they twice took on Saturday but they are not so much better than Sean Dyche\xe2\x80\x99s injury-stricken side \xe2\x80\x93 who moved off the bottom of the table with this point \xe2\x80\x93 that they can afford to take their foot off the gas.</p> <p>Injuries mean Burnley are not only lacking Danny Ings, who could be back after the international break, and Sam Vokes, their strike partnership in last season\xe2\x80\x99s successful promotion campaign, but an entire midfield so a point here is not to be sniffed at. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought we were terrific,\xe2\x80\x9d Dyche said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis was much more of a reminder of what we\xe2\x80\x99re about, with the will and the determination. Teams have only come away from us once, last Sunday [in the 4-0 defeat at West Bromwich Albion].\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pearson described this as \xe2\x80\x9ca bit of a Championship game\xe2\x80\x9d as Burnley \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t come here to play any fluid football\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>He added: \xe2\x80\x9cWe did OK, could have done slightly better, but overall I was pretty pleased with the way we dominated the game. We did enough to have won. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t really trouble us today.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re better than we were last year, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99re as good as they were last season, on today\xe2\x80\x99s evidence, although I know they\xe2\x80\x99ve got injuries. But what they do have is spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Leicester looked to have done enough to win thanks to their more enterprising play and goals from Jeff Schlupp and Riyad Mahrez, their energetic wide men, but they sat too deep in the latter stages and paid the price.</p> <p>As the home side started progressively with two up front, Mahrez, the Algerian, was permitted too much space to cross from the right for Schlupp to turn in his first Premier League goal.</p> <p>But shortly after Burnley had broken their club record time without a goal, set in 1970, they finally relaxed sufficiently to score.</p> <p>The man who had given them the lead on the opening Monday of the season to antagonise Chelsea into life in a match which they lost 3-1, Scott Arfield, was allowed to cross from the left for Lukas Jutkiewicz to head down for Kightly to poke home with his studs.</p> <p>Yet the excitement must have gone to their heads for within a minute Leicester had regained the lead. Jamie Vardy\xe2\x80\x99s cross from the left wing deflected up off Jason Shackell perfectly for Mahrez to run in unmarked and head home.</p> <p>Just as Leicester seemed to have done enough, their willingness to sit back cost them dearly. Seven minutes of stoppage time were added, mainly for the late delay caused when Kieran Trippier was slowly taken off the field on a stretcher. With one minute remaining, Matty James, the Leicester substitute, tripped Arfield. From the free-kick, Wallace, a Burnley substitute, curled his shot into the top corner for Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s fourth draw of the season.</p>'
