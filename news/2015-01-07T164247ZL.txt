b'Leicester City break transfer record to sign Croatia\xe2\x80\x99s Andrej Kramaric'


b'<p>Leicester City have agreed the signing of Andrej Kramaric for a club-record fee, believed to be close to \xc2\xa39.7m, and the Croatia striker\xe2\x80\x99s transfer from HNK Rijeka is set to go through subject to a work permit being granted. The signing of Kramaric represents quite a coup for Leicester, given that Chelsea have also pursued the Croatian international.</p> <p>The 23-year-old has scored 28 goals in 24 appearances for Rijeka and the national team this season and had looked to be on his way to Stamford Bridge in this window. However, it appears that Rijeka\xe2\x80\x99s asking price and the fact that Leicester are able to guarantee Kramaric regular first-team football has swung the deal in favour of the Midlands club.</p> <p>Although Leicester have yet to formally announce that Kramaric has joined them, a statement on the Rijeka website said that the deal had been finalised. \xe2\x80\x9cNow officially we can say that [Rijeka] has completed the transfer of Andrej Kramaric to Leicester City,\xe2\x80\x9d Ivan Mance, Rijeka\xe2\x80\x99s sporting director, said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are glad that the whole job [is] completed to mutual satisfaction and thanks to all who participated and helped to realise the biggest transfer in the club\xe2\x80\x99s history.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
