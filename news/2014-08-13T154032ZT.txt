b'The Fiver | A one-man vanguard for the modern era'


b'O CAPTAIN! MY CAPTAIN! <p>The Fiver has it on good authority that there is nothing harder than successfully negotiating a majestic payrise as reward for risible underperformance and mardy entitlement. The task requires charm, eloquence, wit and chutzpah \xe2\x80\x93 all the more so if the relevant bosses happen to be a rapacious bunch of grasping, miserly, selfish, ignorant, appalling ingrates.</p> <p>So it can be odd to see Wayne Rooney, the new Manchester United captain, criticised and chastised, when the reality is that he is the worker\xe2\x80\x99s champion, a one-man vanguard for the modern era. Not only has he twice confronted those who seek to control him, but in so doing has exemplified precisely the candour absent in those who play with him, challenging the expropriation of his club\xe2\x80\x99s funds to the detriment of those who form its true constituency.</p> <p>But Rooney is no simple shop steward, rather an artist specialising in the sensitivities of human fallibility. Not since Steve Bruce has his team had a leader with such avant-garde interpretation of first touch, nor the ability to translate the darkest, most nightmarish visions of body and mind on to his chosen canvas of football pitch; even his worst is the best of the worst. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a great inspiration to the younger members of the team,\xe2\x80\x9d cooed Louis van Gaal, who can but hope that, one day, they attain his stratospheric standards of self-acceptance.</p> <p>In this pathetic world of pretence that we have no choice but to inhabit, the Fiver can, at least, take solace and be inspired by a man so devoted to the needs of the community as to be entirely devoid of stricture or shame. Would that we were all of such style and substance.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf you score six goals you expect to win the game\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Dagenham &amp; Redbridge manager Wayne Burnett reflects on his team\xe2\x80\x99s penalty shootout exit against Brentford in the Rumbelows Cup, the match having finished 6-6 after extra-time.</p> BREAKING GLASS HOUSE NEWS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s great to have but an accident waiting to happen. And this [incident] in the summer, although it was with Uruguay, although it didn\xe2\x80\x99t directly involve the Premier League, clearly it reflected on Liverpool as one of our great clubs. And it reflected on us. I can\xe2\x80\x99t say I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry to see him go\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 chief suit Richard Scudamore takes a pop at Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez for harming the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s image.</p> <p>Hmm, reminds us of something \xe2\x80\xa6</p> <p>11 May: \xe2\x80\x9cI accept the contents are inappropriate and apologise for any offence caused, particularly to the former employee. It was an error of judgment\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 chief suit Richard Scudamore sort-of-apologises for sending $exist slurs in a series of emails leaked by his former PA and harming the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s image.</p> RECOMMENDED VIEWING <p>Here\xe2\x80\x99s the latest edition of The Guardian Football Show, with Nat Coombs and Jonathan Wilson.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel.

Poor 21-goal Yanick Manzizila, his success gone in the blink of an eye. A bit like Tonton\xe2\x80\x99s, though he will always live on in our hearts, minds, and hard drives\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Liam McGuigan.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI enjoyed yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s letter about Swedish football if only for it\xe2\x80\x99s mention of Balrog Botkyrka, surely named after the Street Fighter II character. I wonder if there are similarly inspired teams out there, FC Ryu or Chun-Li City perhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Phil Walsh [what about transformations into Streetie characters? \xe2\x80\x93 Fiver Ed].</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cA team called Balrog lost 33-0? Did they take it literally when Gandalf said: \xe2\x80\x98You shall not pass!\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Tim Grey (and others).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe the discussion about equipment that referees need to take on to the pitch in order to determine the correct distance away that defenders should stand for a free-kick (Fiver letters passim). Surely what the ref needs is a 10-yard piece of string tied to a stick. The stick should then be stuck into the ground where the kick is to be taken from and the other end tied to the can of foam. Then, by keeping the string tight, the ref can draw an arc the correct distance from the free-kick. Everyone (including refs) seems to have missed the fact that the line should not be straight. In fact, it should actually be a complete circle to ensure no defenders encroach behind the ball. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure everyone would agree that the sight of refs trying to draw a circle with their foam, and doing it before the first bit of foam disappears, would only add another dimension of entertainment to the game\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Nigel Sangster.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think a risk is being ignored here. I remember being just a lad when a can of expanding filler overheated in the sun and exploded while my old man, a part-time painter/decorator, was using it. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but be reminded of this incident during the introductory usage of Vanishing Spray\xe2\x84\xa2 at the World Cup. Now, I know temperatures on Teesside don\xe2\x80\x99t approach those in Manaus, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t stop myself imagining Mark Clattenburg jumping out of his skin as his belt-mounted spray can pops all over him; or indeed the look of pure terror on his face as the right half of his torso slowly fades from view, \xc3\xa0 la Kevin Bacon in the 2000 film Hollow Man. In case anyone\xe2\x80\x99s wondering, my dad was fine and received \xc2\xa3100 in Screwfix vouchers by way of compensation\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ben Jones.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI believe a referee\xe2\x80\x99s gentleman (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s letters) is an old-school idea and does little to take advantage of the latest cutting-edge technological advancements (a la foam) in the game. Instead, we should consider deploying flying drones during games, equipped with all bells and whistles like sophisticated lasers and what not, which would be piloted by referees sitting comfortably on the side, sipping a cup of English breakfast tea with biscuits. Ref fitness conditions and all may go to hell\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Adham Davlatov.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI noticed in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Bits and Bobs that knack is worse than ouch. All these years I\xe2\x80\x99ve thought that you were using your injury thesaurus randomly, but now I realise there\xe2\x80\x99s a hierarchy. Does it go: ouch &lt; knack &lt; gah? But surely there\xe2\x80\x99s worse than gah? Clearly the terminology needs expanding. I suggest: ouch &lt; knack &lt; gah &lt; schtroumpf &lt; Gargamel &lt; Schniedelwichsen\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 K\xc3\xa1ri Tulinius.</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
