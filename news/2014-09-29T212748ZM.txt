b'    Man City prepare for Roma showdown \xe2\x80\x93 video    <p>Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League ambitions are on a tightrope as Roma visit for Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s Group E match. Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s side need to win or next month\xe2\x80\x99s trip to CSKA Moscow becomes a game of Russian roulette.</p> <p>City need to win the group so as to have the best hope of advancing beyond the last 16. Yet Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s balancing act is complicated by having to ensure they make a credible defence of the championship, unlike the dismal effort of two years ago.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf we can fight for the Premier League title and get further in the Champions League, that would be progress,\xe2\x80\x9d the City manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is important to progress in the Champions League but not by forgetting the domestic league. We won\xe2\x80\x99t focus all we have on the Champions League and see what happens in the Premier League.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut if we have to leave behind the Premier League to win the Champions League, then for me that isn\xe2\x80\x99t progress.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ashley Cole, Roma\xe2\x80\x99s left-back who refused to answer a question about Rio Ferdinand\xe2\x80\x99s claims to have felt betrayed by Cole over the John Terry-Anton Ferdinand racial abuse case, believes it is City who are under the cosh.</p>           Manchester City under pressure against Roma, says Ashley Cole \xe2\x80\x93 video    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they have not been [beyond the last 16] and there is pressure on them. They have big players and I know some of them are very hungry \xe2\x80\x93 [Joe] Hart and [James] Milner and Lamps [Frank Lampard] will always want to keep on winning. There\xe2\x80\x99s less pressure on us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Could a victory kill off City in the group? \xe2\x80\x9cOf course it will make it more difficult for them to qualify,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be a tough game. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want to think that far ahead. It will make it hard for them to catch up certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>While defeat by Roma at the Etihad Stadium could be filed under \xe2\x80\x9cdisaster\xe2\x80\x9d as this would leave City with no points from two games and the Italians a maximum of six, even a draw would have City arriving in Moscow needing a victory to have any chance of topping the group.</p> <p>For 90 minutes at Bayern Munich a fortnight ago the aim of getting off to a solid start was on course as City held Bayern 0-0. J\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xb4me Boateng\xe2\x80\x99s late winner and Roma\xe2\x80\x99s 5-1 hiding of CSKA sent City home playing serious catch-up.</p> <p>The defeat of CSKA was masterminded by Rudi Garc\xc3\xada, the colourful manager who has enjoyed life in the eternal city since taking over at the start of last season.</p> <p>Garc\xc3\xada can be found on YouTube happily strumming a guitar and singing and last week he tweeted confirmation of his relationship with the former Miss Italia contestant Francesca Brienza, a presenter for Roma\xe2\x80\x99s in-house television channel.</p> <p>Last season the Frenchman guided Roma to second place in Serie A and his team have won all five league games this campaign to be second behind Juventus on goal difference.</p> <p>Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a very good manager and has a very good team with technical and fast players. I think about Roma, it is a very good team, not only because it is in a very good moment having played five games and won five. Last season was also a very good team and the manager Garc\xc3\xada, in the beginning it was his first year and maybe no one was sure exactly what he could do but he started winning all the games and qualified his team for the Champions League.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Manuel Pellegrini, left, alongside Joe Hart in the runup to the Champions League game against Roma Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA    <p>Garc\xc3\xada recruited Cole on a free transfer from Chelsea in the summer to pair the left-back with Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup right-back Maicon in a team who still have the venerable Francesco Totti, 38, as their focal point.</p> <p>Hart, who is line to be recalled after being dropped for City\xe2\x80\x99s past two matches, accepts the challenge will not be easy. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a big game after a disappointing start in Munich,\xe2\x80\x9d the goalkeeper said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are aware it is the Champions League and not knockout phase but especially at home we are going in trying to win the game.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey have been doing very well. We have focused a lot more on them since they were drawn in our group. They got a great result on match day one. Every game is tough in Champions League but we are up for it and more than capable of winning. It is pretty much standard for the Champions League.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe have always had tough groups in our brief Champions League history. They are big nights. We all understand you have to do well at home and it is great to see Ash. It\xe2\x80\x99s brave to make the move out to Roma after a great career at Arsenal and Chelsea and great to catch up and see how he is doing out there.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>City cannot afford another slip-up. As well as at Bayern, late goals have been conceded to Real Madrid and Barcelona in recent seasons, as Hart is all too aware. \xe2\x80\x9cThose have cost us the game in some big games,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut also shown we are definitely up there and can play with the big boys and we just need to finish the game off.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
