b'Didier Drogba leads celebrations after Ivory Coast\xe2\x80\x99s Africa Cup of Nations win'


b'<p>Didier Drogba led the celebrations as Ivory Coast ended more than two decades without a trophy by beating Ghana on penalties to lift the Africa Cup of Nations on Sunday night.</p> <p>The Chelsea striker, who retired from international football last year after earning a record 104 caps, posted a video on Instagram of the moment when goalkeeper Boubacar Barry scored the winning penalty with the message \xe2\x80\x9cCoooopaaaa faut marquer buuulaaaaa cooooopaaaaa!!!!!!!!!\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Drogba featured in three finals for Les \xc3\x89l\xc3\xa9phants but never finished on the winning side. After being drafted in as a replacement for the regular goalkeeper Sylvain Gbohouo, who had suffered a thigh strain, understandably it was Barry \xe2\x80\x93 a 35-year-old who plays for the Belgian side Lokeren \xe2\x80\x93 who was the toast of a nation.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a great day,\xe2\x80\x9d Barry told the French broadcaster Canal+. It is the ninth birthday of my son today \xe2\x80\x93 God does not do things by accident. I have been criticised. I\xe2\x80\x99m not big in talent, or size, but I want to progress and I have shown the critics.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Barry then appeared to break down as he paid tribute to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s support throughout his career. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mum suffered. Thanks to her, thank you to all Ivorians. Football allowed me to travel, there is no room for everyone; but there is room for the work. God rewarded me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Another former Chelsea striker, Salomon Kalou of Hertha Berlin, also paid tribute to his side\xe2\x80\x99s success, posting a picture of himself with the captain Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 when they were teenagers with the message: \xe2\x80\x9cWe started from the bottom now we here. With my bro #yayatoure #championsleagues #premiereleague #facup #carlingcup #africancup. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad we went for everything they said we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have. And it was just a dream not long ago. Bravo a toi mon Frero #avecclass\xe2\x80\x9d.</p>    <p>We started from the bottom now we here. With my bro #yayatoure #championsleagues #premiereleague\xe2\x80\xa6 http://t.co/ehJOJz1x3F</p>&mdash; Salomon Kalou (@salomonkalou) February 9, 2015    <p>The coach Herv\xc3\xa9 Renard became the first man to win the Africa Cup of Nations with two countries having previously led Zambia to the title in 2012 with a penalty shootout victory over Ivory Coast. The Frenchman described the victory as \xe2\x80\x9cmagic for everyone\xe2\x80\x9d in the country .</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m happy for the Ivorian people. They have been rewarded,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis victory is magic for everyone. It brings [together] even those who do not share the same opinions. Ivory Coast will be delighted and this is the most important thing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Renard added: \xe2\x80\x9cI felt we could win this tournament after the game against a great Cameroon. We were in a very difficult group and the players did what we never imagined.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAt 2-0 down on penalties, I told myself that history would repeat itself, there was belief to the end. Just before Barry hits the penalty, I said: \xe2\x80\x98A goalkeeper who worked with Jean-Marc Guillou is able to pull it off\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
