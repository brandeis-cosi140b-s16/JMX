b'<p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis international break has seen bottom seeds the Faroe Islands, San Marino and Liechtenstein all bagging points,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Jack Matthijnssens. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat has been the biggest ever shock result in international football going by Fifa rankings?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>By our reckoning, the Faroes\xe2\x80\x99 stunning win over Greece can claim to be the biggest international shock ever when it comes to the Fifa rankings. Greece were No18 in the world coming into the latest round of international fixtures, the Faroe Islands No187 (sandwiched between Chinese Taipei and South Sudan). A rankings equivalent to the Faroes\xe2\x80\x99 win would be the tiny Caribbean island of Monserrat beating Germany. Or Brazil losing to S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 e Pr\xc3\xadncipe (though the players could at least talk in that fixture \xe2\x80\x93 S\xc3\xa3o Tom\xc3\xa9 e Pr\xc3\xadncipe is, fact fans, the smallest Portuguese speaking country in the world).</p> <p>Very bottom of the rankings is No209, so there\xe2\x80\x99s not very much scope for anyone to eclipse the Faroe Islands\xe2\x80\x99s 169-place victory. And time plays a role too \xe2\x80\x93 Fifa\xe2\x80\x99s ranking system came into being in December 1992, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no chance of, say, USA 1-0 England in 1950 or North Korea 1-0 Italy in 1966 featuring. Although even if rankings had existed then, neither of those results would have come close to the Faroes: by July 1980 Fifa had 150 members and it only hit 200 when the Turks &amp; Caicos Island became members in June 1998. Finally, and most crucially, teams towards the bottom of the rankings tend to win about as often as Burnley.</p> <p>So there\xe2\x80\x99s a fairly narrow window for suitable shocks. A trawl (and we do mean a trawl) through the archives brought a couple of notable efforts. In November 2011 Lebanon, then world No146, beat South Korea (No29) in AFC World Cup qualifying \xe2\x80\x93 a gap of 117 places \xe2\x80\x93 and in November 2010 the Central African Republic (No172) pulled off one of the great Africa Cup of Nations shocks with a 2-0 win over Algeria (No35) in qualifying, a commendable gap of 137 places.</p> <p>But that is as close as we can get to the Faroe Islands\xe2\x80\x99 feat. If you can do any better then let us know at the usual address \xe2\x80\x93 knowledge@theguardian.com.</p> BETTER THAN GIGGS? <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe always heard the statistic that Ryan Giggs was the only player to have scored in every Premier League season (until his final one),\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Caoimh\xc3\xadn O\xe2\x80\x99Donnellan last week. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I was wondering when was the last time he was not the only player to have scored in every Premier League season? Who had scored in every season from the beginning up until they left the division or retired or lost their goalscoring touch? Or who had scored in the most consecutive seasons at any stage before or after the birth of the Premier League?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As plenty of people emailed to point out, the late Gary Speed has that particular honour. \xe2\x80\x9cHe scored in every Premier League season that he played in from 1992-93 to 2007-08, for 17 in a row - matching Giggs for a while,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Gavin Reed. \xe2\x80\x9cIn fact, his league scoring record is slightly more impressive. He scored in every season from 1989-90 to 2008-09.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> IS THERE ANYTHING ON THE OTHER CHANNEL? <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLast Saturday [8 November] almost looked like having a notable lack of goals in the 3pm kick-offs, before a late flurry,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Toby Sandison last week. \xe2\x80\x9cI wondered what is the least number of goals to have been broadcast on a Saturday edition of Match of the Day?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Sometimes an email arrives in the Knowledge inbox that answers a question so satisfyingly that it would seem a shame not to simply let it speak for itself. So we\xe2\x80\x99ll hand this one over to reader Steve Williams:</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis was always a potential problem in the 70s and 80s when Match of the Day could only show action from two matches, picked in advance, and if they were both rubbish it was tough luck. Hence on 22 April 1978, the programme was made up of Coventry 0-0 Nottingham Forest and Middlesbrough 0-0 Everton, the only two goalless games of a First Division programme that also included two 4-1s and four 3-0s. However Forest\xe2\x80\x99s point at Coventry did confirm them as league champions, so it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t an entirely pointless show.Since the Premier League began, Match of the Day (and from 2001-04, The Premiership on ITV) have been able to show all the goals from every top-flight game so the chances of a goalless programme have been greatly reduced. Since then, I would suspect the lowest number of goals from a full Saturday fixture list was three from six games on Saturday 24 November 2001. The results were Bolton 0-0 Fulham, Chelsea 0-0 Blackburn, Leicester 0-0 Everton, Newcastle 1-0 Derby, Southampton 1-0 Charlton, West Ham 0-1 Spurs.This was during the period The Premiership was on ITV and indeed was just one week after it had been moved from its original 7pm slot to 10.30pm \xe2\x80\x93 not a moment too soon as the ability to create Saturday night primetime entertainment from that lot would have taxed Simon Cowell.Four matches were moved to the Sunday for TV and European commitments, and that included a fourth 0-0 between Middlesbrough and Ipswich and a fourth 1-0 between Liverpool and Sunderland. Leeds and Villa drew 1-1 and Arsenal rather let the side down by being the only side to score more than one goal by beating Man U 3-1. The grand total of 10 goals in 10 games must surely be a record low for a complete round of top flight fixtures \xe2\x80\x93 mustn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p>Spare a thought, though, for TV directors in Italy in the 1970s and 80s, when Serie A matchdays were regularly pretty goal-free affairs. In September 1979 the opening weekend of the season saw six goals in nine games (eight of which were draws). Whatever the mid-1980s Italian equivalent of the Football League Show was also had it tough as these results from round 14 of the 1984-85 season show: Arezzo 0-0 Genoa, Bari 1-1 Pisa, Campobasso 1-0 Cagliari, Cesena 0-0 Varese, Monza 1-1 Bologna, Padova 0-0 Pescara, Parma 0-1 Lecce, Sambenedettese 0-0 Empoli, Taranto 0-0 Catania, Triestina 0-0 Perugia.</p> KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIs it really true that a Romanian side once built a moat filled with crocodiles to stop the crowd from invading the pitch?\xe2\x80\x9d wondered Ben Evans back in the innocent days of 2006.</p> <p>Incredibly, this snappy piece of hooligan deterrence actually was planned. Back in 2003, fourth-division Steaua Nicolae Balcescu found themselves in a quandary: Romanian leagues chiefs were threatening the club with expulsion following a series of pitch invasions and violent outbreaks. What was the club to do? Perimeter fencing? Increased stewarding? Not quite.</p> <p>Chairman Alexandra Cringus came up with the \xe2\x80\x98innovative\xe2\x80\x99 concept of creating a moat surrounding the pitch, packed with fully-grown crocodiles. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not a joke,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted Cringus. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can get crocodiles easy enough and feed them on meat from the local abattoir. The ditch is planned to be wide enough that no one could manage to jump over it. Anyone who attempted to do so would have to deal with the crocs. I think that the problem of fans running on to the pitch will be solved once and for all.\xe2\x80\x9d You don\xe2\x80\x99t say.</p> <p>And what of players tumbling off the field and into the watering hole? Cringus planned to create the moat far enough from the pitch in order to prevent said calamity, yet not forgetting about the crocs; electric pipes were to be installed in the water as to keep it heated during cold weather. The last we heard of the tale was that local authorities were considering the club\xe2\x80\x99s proposal.</p> <p>For thousands more sepia-tinged questions and answers, take a trip through Knowledge archive.</p> CAN YOU HELP? <p>\xe2\x80\x9cUpon musing at the trend of football managers having their initials on their jackets or tracksuit tops, I wondered if any manager has been replaced with another who has the same initials, thus saving the expense of new matchday apparel?\xe2\x80\x9d ponders thrifty Ed Ginzler.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cJames Milner has now amassed 52 England caps, but has only played 2,812 minutes, averaging at just over 54 minutes per game,\xe2\x80\x9d noted James Hamilton before the game with Scotland. \xe2\x80\x9cHas any other international footballer have a lower minutes-per-game ratio? (Let\xe2\x80\x99s say a 10-cap minimum for qualification).\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOn 18 November Stockport County play at Chorley, 115 years and two weeks to the day since the two teams last met in a competitive first-team match,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Edward Keane. \xe2\x80\x9cHas there ever been a longer gap between matches between two teams, (discounting teams that have been reformed or forcibly relegated due to financial irregularities/rule breaking) in English/British/European/world football?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLast week there were five Athens-based teams playing in European competition,\xe2\x80\x9d begins Scott Wedel. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the most number of teams in one city playing in the country\xe2\x80\x99s top-flight league without any of them playing in European competition?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Aris Moro and I have a question,\xe2\x80\x9d begins Aris Moro, who has a question. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was younger, my football coach asked me if it were possible for a team to score two consecutive goals without the opposition touching the ball in between. In Fifa \xe2\x80\x9805 it was impossible, which is why I said \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99. He then proceeded to explain to me that one team can score a goal right before half-time with the referee blowing his whistle right after the goal was scored, and then start from kick-off and score again. It can happen then. But has it ever happened?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your questions and answers to the lovely people at knowledge@theguardian.com.</p>'
