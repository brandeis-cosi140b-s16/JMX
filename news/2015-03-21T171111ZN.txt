b'Newcastle United 1-2 Arsenal | Premier League match report'


b'<p>So Arsenal continue to keep Manuel Pellegrini and perhaps even Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho sweating while Newcastle United sleepwalk their way towards the end of a deeply unsatisfactory season? Well, not entirely; sometimes scorelines fail to tell quite the whole story.</p> <p>Despite a combination of injuries and suspensions to key personnel leaving John Carver\xe2\x80\x99s side with a distinctly ersatz look, Newcastle were not quite so makeshift in practice. Indeed, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger was probably extremely relieved to escape with three points on a day when Olivier Giroud\xe2\x80\x99s two first-half goals following set pieces kept Arsenal four points behind the leaders Chelsea and only one in arrears of second-placed Manchester City.</p>  <p> Related: Tottenham Hotspur 4-3 Leicester City | Premier League match report </p>   <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe last 40 minutes were difficult,\xe2\x80\x9d acknowledged Wenger. \xe2\x80\x9cNewcastle played very well in the second half.\xe2\x80\x9d Tired after their midweek Champions League exertions against Monaco, his team faded as the day wore on but still did just enough to record a sixth straight Premier League victory and remind everyone they are not about to settle for staying third. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are in the fight,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to do as well as we can.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>With Daryl Janmaat outstanding in an unfamiliar central defensive role, Newcastle succeeded in surprising some of their own supporters. \xe2\x80\x9cThere wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much in it until we conceded the first goal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carver. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s always disappointing to lose to two set-piece goals but we showed we\xe2\x80\x99re not on our holidays yet. And we also showed that, even when you\xe2\x80\x99re down to the bare bones, if you prepare and set up properly you give yourselves a chance.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>All pace, possession and intelligent movement, Newcastle began deceptively brightly. Then Jack Colback, Carver\xe2\x80\x99s left-back for the day, played it short to Vurnon Anita. The midfielder should have been able to move the ball forward but, seemingly unsure what to do, he unwisely passed back to Colback who was now under pressure from Giroud.</p> <p>Colback was left with little option but to impede the Arsenal striker and concede a free-kick. Up stepped Santi Cazorla and in curved the set piece, allowing Danny Welbeck to flick on before Giroud directed the ball over the line with his left knee.</p> <p>It was not long before Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s French centre-forward scored again. This time Cazorla whipped in a corner and Giroud got across his marker before squeezing a header into the far bottom corner. It was his 17th goal in 26 appearances this season and eighth in six games against Newcastle.</p> <p>Considering Carver\xe2\x80\x99s back four comprised a midfielder who has spent much of the past few years battling serious injury (Ryan Taylor) at right-back, a right-back (Janmaat) at centre-half and a midfielder (Colback) at left-back, Newcastle were probably doing as well as could be expected in the circumstances. Much more acclaimed positional specialists have struggled similarly in the face of Cazorla, Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez, Giroud and friends. Not that this reality prevented an initially buoyant 50,000-plus crowd from booing the home team off at the interval. The Gallowgate End wanted to see David Ospina\xe2\x80\x99s goal put under much more pressure.</p> <p>Happily for Carver, Moussa Sissoko changed the narrative right at the start of the second half. Cued up by a wonderful one-two involving Ayoze P\xc3\xa9rez and R\xc3\xa9my Cabella, the midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s low, first-time, right-foot shot whizzed past Ospina as Arsenal suddenly found themselves firmly on the back foot.</p>  <p> Related: Stoke City 1-2 Crystal Palace | Premier League match report </p>   <p>Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s players looked winded in the face of Sissoko\xe2\x80\x99s all-round dynamism and Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s collective powers of counterattacking acceleration. They might have conceded an equaliser but P\xc3\xa9rez dispatched a curling 25-yard shot fractionally wide and then the same striker miscued an inviting shooting chance.</p> <p>No matter: the momentum was with those wearing black and white and the choruses of Blaydon Races echoing around the ground confirmed the mood had transformed almost beyond recognition.</p> <p>With Jon\xc3\xa1s Guti\xc3\xa9rrez offering the Tynesiders further impetus after replacing Anita and Janmaat\xe2\x80\x99s classy ease in possession frequently discomforting a thwarted Arsenal attack, a home equaliser would have been thoroughly deserved.</p> <p>Instead Carver and company were left all out of luck as Wenger kept on confounding those doubters who, until very recently, claimed he had overstayed his welcome in north London. How wrong can you be?</p>'
