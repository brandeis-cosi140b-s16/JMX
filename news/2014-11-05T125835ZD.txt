b'Divock Origi set to give Merseyside a glimpse of his talent to come'


b'<p>Given Divock Origi\xe2\x80\x99s family background, it is no surprise that the 19-year-old has already made it to the top. The striker signed by Liverpool for \xc2\xa310m in the summer and then promptly loaned back to Lille is preparing to make his first appearance on Merseyside against Everton in the Europa League on Thursday.</p> <p>Yet the speed of his development has come as a shock, even to his father Mike. Known as Mike Okoth during his own glittering career, Origi Sr became the first Kenyan player to feature in any top European league when he moved to play for the Belgian club KV Oostende in 1992.</p> <p>A striker, he played in three Africa Cup of Nations finals for the Harambee Stars and spent more than a decade in the Jupiler League before choosing to settle in the country after his career came to end. Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s loss has very much been Belgium\xe2\x80\x99s gain as in the summer Origi became their youngest goalscorer with his winning strike against Russia in the group stages of the World Cup.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been part of the Belgian youth system from the age of 14 and has played in all of the various categories up to the senior team,\xe2\x80\x9d reflects Mike.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was his decision, he had to choose what he wants. He decided to choose Belgium over Kenya and I support him in what he did. It is where he feels comfortable and grew up his whole life. It is what he thought was best.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>There is an African proverb that states: \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you follow the path of your father, you learn to walk like him.\xe2\x80\x9d Origi Jr certainly seems to have taken this to heart as he blazed through the Belgian youth system that has produced so many world-class players in recent years.</p> <p>Starting out at local club Waimes and then Park Houthalen until he turned nine, he was then snapped up by Racing Genk\xe2\x80\x99s youth academy. Growing up in the same system that produced Belgium team-mates Steven Defour, Thibaut Courtois and Kevin De Bruyne, Origi earned a reputation as one of the country\xe2\x80\x99s brightest prospects and was signed by Lille at the age of 15.</p> <p>Within three years, he had made his debut for Les Dogues\xe2\x80\x99 first team and scored within six minutes of coming on as a substitute against Troyes in Ligue 1. At the age of 17 year and 10 months, Origi became the second youngest goalscorer in the history of the French league.</p> <p>By the start of the next season, he had become first choice under new coach Ren\xc3\xa9 Girard and was often paired up front with the former Chelsea striker Salomon Kalou. Five league goals as Lille ended the season in third place were enough to persuade the Belgium coach Marc Wilmots to hand Origi his senior debut in the World Cup qualifier against Serbia.</p> <p>The serious achilles injury suffered by the Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke in March created an opportunity and despite being courted by Kenya, he was named in Wilmots\xe2\x80\x99 World Cup squad. Most pundits expected the 19-year-old to be taken for the experience but he came on for Romelu Lukaku in the opening match in Brazil against Algeria and then against Russia.</p> <p>His winning strike in the Maracan\xc3\xa3 with just two minutes of the match remaining made Origi Belgium\xe2\x80\x99s youngest goalscorer at the finals and the first player of Kenyan descent to achieve the same feat, a milestone not lost on his father.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a very proud moment to see my son play and above all score in Brazil,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mike. \xe2\x80\x9cI was there and as a former player, I know that is the tournament every player wants to play in. I did not get the chance, Kenya never has but Divock did. For all the sacrifices he made, it was a reward for the hard work.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Origi\xe2\x80\x99s displays did not go unnoticed. After he was preferred to Lukaku for both the last-16 victory over USA and then the quarter-final defeat to Argentina, Liverpool followed up their earlier interest by agreeing a deal that loaned back to Lille for the season.</p> <p>Given Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 headaches in attack this season following the departure of Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez to Barcelona, the manager may be wishing he had done things differently. Fans on Merseyside will be granted their first chance to see Origi in action on Thursday, albeit against Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s fiercest rivals.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is his chance to feel the atmosphere of the English fans and know what awaits,\xe2\x80\x9d says his father. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is good exposure for him and he will get experience facing an African great like Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o. Playing in the Europa League this season has been fantastic for his development.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>After breaking records throughout his fledgling career, Origi should take it all in his stride.</p>'
