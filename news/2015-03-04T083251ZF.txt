b"Football transfer rumours: Manchester United after Porto's Danilo?"


b'<p>Netflix is remaking Richie Rich. Perhaps this should come as no surprise, but the Rumour Mill is a delicate soul that cherishes its childhood memories and cannot abide the thought of any Macaulay Culkin part being recast. But here we are. Nothing is new anymore. History keeps repeating, so apologies if today\xe2\x80\x99s rumours evoke a sense of d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu, or even ennui. It\xe2\x80\x99s not our fault, it is just the way of the world. </p> <p>Cinemas are full of remakes, Blur are back and football is an implausibly predictable series of events, with the same teams competing for the same prizes year in, year out. We are just a few short weeks away from the top four of the Premier League being a close facsimile of last season\xe2\x80\x99s final standings \xe2\x80\x93 albeit with one plaything of an unimaginably rich billionaire taking the place at the top from another plaything of an unimaginably rich plaything. </p> <p>And so it is, Netflix is remaking Richie Rich. Nothing is new any more. The story of a \xe2\x80\x9cpoor little rich boy\xe2\x80\x9d of incredible wealth, who has at least two of everything that money can buy will hold particular significance for those competing at the top of the table \xe2\x80\x93 two players for every position don\xe2\x80\x99t you know. Manchester United can feel his pain. Despite splashing nearly \xc2\xa3160m last summer \xe2\x80\x93 with the result being an infinitesimal improvement in results \xe2\x80\x93 the board will back Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy again this summer, in the hope that they can prise the fourth-place trophy from Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s steely paws in 2016. Their latest target is a Brazilian right-back called Da Silva \xe2\x80\x93 don\xe2\x80\x99t they already have one of those? Yes they do, but as Richie and the Rumour Mill know, one is never enough. Danilo, as this Da Silva likes to be known, has 11 caps for Brazil, and the 23-year-old has a \xc2\xa337m release clause at Porto, so the Home Office will be more than happy to rubber-stamp a work permit. </p> <p>At Stamford Bridge, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho is not content with a title win to go with Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s League Cup triumph. Unhappy with being \xe2\x80\x9cforced\xe2\x80\x9d to take the progressive move of shifting centre-half Kurt Zouma into midfield to replace the suspended Nemanja Matic he is on the lookout for midfield reinforcements. That\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s sent his chief scout out to Belgium to watch the Anderlecht youngsters Youri Tielemans, 17, and Leander Dendoncker, 20. Having two of everything money can buy should ensure that if Matic has to take a leaf out of John Terry\xe2\x80\x99s book again and go, to borrow a phrase popular on the internets, \xe2\x80\x9cfull-kit wanker\xe2\x80\x9d after missing another cup final in order to crowbar his way into the celebratory piccies, at least Chelsea will have a specialist to take up his position. </p> <p>Meanwhile at Arsenal, it\xe2\x80\x99s d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu as a team crying out for the sturdy central midfielder that could actually make them contenders again will ignore the obvious links to Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s Rumour Mill favourite Morgan Schneiderlin. Instead, the \xc2\xa350m war chest will be spent on a couple more little, nippy attackers. Boca Junior\xe2\x80\x99s Jonathan Calleri fits the bill, as does Paulo Dybala of Palermo. Two Argentinian strikers, because one is never enough.</p> <p>Unfortunately the latter seems more keen on a move to Spain. \xe2\x80\x9cWould I be open to a move to Barcelona? I would swim to Barcelona if they came knocking,\xe2\x80\x9d Dybala told Catalan radio. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even have to change into my swimming gear. After all, I would only have to cross the Mediterranean Sea.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t poor little Paulo know that Bar\xc3\xa7a have a transfer ban? In any case, the quickest way for a player to get to Barcelona is to spend a couple of years at the Emirates. Just ask Overmars, Petit, Van Bronckhorst, Hleb, Henry, F\xc3\xa0bregas, Song or Vermaelen. </p> <p>Plus \xc3\xa7a change, as Wenger would say. </p>'
