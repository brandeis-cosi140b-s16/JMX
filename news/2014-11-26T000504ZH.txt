b'Has a team ever scored twice without the opposition touching the ball?  | The Knowledge'


b'<p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy name is Aris Moro and I have a question,\xe2\x80\x9d begins Aris Moro, who has a question. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was younger, my football coach asked me if it were possible for a team to score two consecutive goals without the opposition touching the ball in between. In Fifa \xe2\x80\x9805 it was impossible, which is why I said \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99. He then proceeded to explain to me that one team can score a goal right before half-time with the referee blowing his whistle right after the goal was scored, and then start from kick-off and score again. It can happen then. But has it ever happened?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As several readers have emailed to point out, it has indeed. Let\xe2\x80\x99s head back to 23 September 2000. The Tamagotchi craze was over, the Sydney Olympics were in full swing, French Euro pop duo Modjo were at No1 with Lady (Hear Me Tonight), and Wycombe Wanderers welcomed Peterborough United to Adams Park for a mid-table Division Two clash.</p> <p>The first 45 minutes was fairly uneventful, but then Wycombe\xe2\x80\x99s Steve Brown was brought down on the edge of the area by Jun Cullen. Up stepped Jamie Bates, who crashed the free-kick through the wall and past Mark Tyler in the Peterborough goal. Referee John Brandwood immediatel blew his whistle before Posh had chance to restart. Half-time, 1-0 to the Wanderers.</p> <p>After the interval 23-year-old Jermaine McSporran kicked off for the home side and headed straight for the Peterborough goal. The defenders, caught napping, let the striker through on goal and he calmly slotted past Tyler to double the advantage. Two goals separated by nine seconds and without the opposition touching the ball.</p> <p>Wycombe would go on to finish 13th but the season was a memorable one: it was the year that they reached the FA Cup semi-finals under Lawrie Sanchez. You can read more on that campaign in this piece on the Two Unfortunates blog and there\xe2\x80\x99s a longer match report on the Peterborough game here.</p> INITIAL ISSUES <p>\xe2\x80\x9cUpon musing at the trend of football managers having their initials on their jackets or tracksuit tops, I wondered if any manager has been replaced with another who has the same initials, thus saving the expense of new matchday apparel?\xe2\x80\x9d pondered thrifty Ed Ginzler last week.</p> <p>There have been a few. Gareth Southgate, for example, was replaced by Gordon Strachan at Middlesbrough, though as Pete Scarborough points out: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if Gareth\xe2\x80\x99s jacket would have fit wee Gordon, though.\xe2\x80\x9d And as Tom Pringle adds: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a bit of a false economy on the kit initials though, as Strachan proceeded to spend every penny in the piggy bank on dross before being sacked himself a year later.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>That does seem to be a theme \xe2\x80\x93 the savings on matchday apparel initials seem to be regularly offset by spending (or general failure) elsewhere. \xe2\x80\x9cWolves did exactly this in March 1994, replacing popular but limited stalwart Graham Turner (two promotions on a shoe-string, Steve Bull, Sherpa Van Trophy) with Graham Taylor (stagnation, tried to sell Steve Bull, Turnip),\xe2\x80\x9d writes Phil Russell. \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough given the transfer budget squandered on the likes of Tony Daley, Mark Atkins, Steve Sedgeley etc I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine cost savings were high on the agenda when he was appointed.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>David Weir replaced Danny Wilson at Sheffield United in the summer of 2013, and won one game before being sacked after 13 matches. And it was a similarly sorry story at Manchester City in 1984. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a diehard Manchester City fan I remember only too well the dark days of the 80s when City truly were a shambles,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Phil Hammond. \xe2\x80\x9cJohn Bond resigned in 1983 to be replaced by assistant manager John Benson. City were duly relegated, Benson was sacked.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe following season Bond went to Burnley, Benson followed him as assistant. Bond was sacked and Benson took over from him as manager again. So that\xe2\x80\x99s two clubs who saved on the reprinting of initials - beat that!\xe2\x80\x9d</p> CAP IN HAND <p>\xe2\x80\x9cJames Milner has now amassed 52 England caps, but has only played 2,812 minutes, averaging at just over 54 minutes per game,\xe2\x80\x9d noted James Hamilton before the game with Scotland. \xe2\x80\x9cHas any other international footballer have a lower minutes-per-game ratio? (Let\xe2\x80\x99s say a 10-cap minimum for qualification).\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The 10-cap minimum is fairly arbitrary but pretty essential. Strictly speaking the Liverpool full-back Martin Kelly has the lowest minutes-per-England-cap ratio with his solitary cap earned thanks to an 88th-minute substitute apperance against Norway in 2012. Similarly, the former Derby County winger Kevin Hector has two-caps despite playing only 18 minutes for England, while Stan Collymore has three earned in 84 minutes of international football. England\xe2\x80\x99s other shortest international careers can be found here.</p> <p>As for those with more than 10 caps, unsurprisingly in these subsitute-heavy times the list is dominated by players of a recent vintage. By our reckoning, Rickie Lambert comes top of the list thanks to his three starts (during which he was twice replaced) and eight substitute appearances. Both he and Ross Barkley have plenty of time to add to those appearances, though, so perhaps the numbers posted by Kieron Dyer, Jermaine Jenas, Alan Smith and Jermain Defoe are the most impressive.</p> <p>Rickie Lambert 11 caps, 316 minutes = 28.7 minutes per cap</p> <p>Kieron Dyer 33 caps, 1088 minutes = 33 minutes per cap</p> <p>Ross Barkley 10 caps, 348 minutes = 34.8 minutes per cap</p> <p>Jermaine Jenas 21 caps, 768 minutes = 36.6 minutes per cap</p> <p>Ray Parlour 10 caps, 381 minutes = 38.1 minutes per cap</p> <p>Alan Smith 19 caps, 774 minutes = 40.7 minutes per cap</p> <p>Darius Vassell 22 caps, 898 minutes = 40.8 minutes per cap</p> <p>Jermain Defoe 55 caps, 2355 minutes = 42.8 minutes per cap</p> <p>Adam Johnson 12 caps, 519 minutes = 43.3 minutes per cap</p> <p>Robbie Fowler 26 caps, 1151 minuts = 44.3 minutes per cap</p> <p>Aaron Lennon 21 caps, 997 minutes = 47.5 minutes per cap</p> <p>Steve Bull 13 caps, 618 minutes = 47.5 minutes per cap</p> <p>Owen Hargreaves 42 caps, 2056 minutes = 48.9 minutes per cap</p> <p>Paul Merson 21 caps, 1041 minutes = 49.6 minutes per cap</p> <p>Peter Crouch 42 caps, 2198 minutes = 52.3 minutes per cap</p> <p>And we should perhaps also pay homage to a few that just missed out:</p> <p>Carlton Cole seven caps, 127 minutes = 18.1 minutes per cap</p> <p>Kieran Richardson eight caps, 174 minutes = 21.75 minutes per cap</p> <p>Danny Murphy nine caps, 287 minutes = 31.9 minutes per cap</p> FAROE ISLANDS: THE AFTERSHOCKS <p>Last week we asked whether the Faroe Islands\xe2\x80\x99 win over Greece in Euro 2016 qualifying was the biggest shock ever and we concluded that, as far as the Fifa rankings were concerned, it almost certainly was. And Thankfully no one has emailed in to tell us otherwise. A few of you have been in touch, though, to add a bit of meat to last week\xe2\x80\x99s bones.</p> <p>Uni Arge of the Faroe Islands reckons that the country\xe2\x80\x99s biggest win came 24 years earlier. \xe2\x80\x9cProbably the biggest upset in football was the Faroese victory against Austria in 1990,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes. \xe2\x80\x9cThis was the islands\xe2\x80\x99 first ever competitive match, and the match was played in Landskrona in Sweden because there were no grass pitches in the Faroe Islands. The Faroese team, which won 1-0, was probably not even ranked at that time, and Austria had just been playing in the World Cup in Italy with stars like Toni Polster and Gerhard Rodax. Today they are ranked 187, but in reality they are much stronger than those remote teams surrounding them on the list. The should probably be ranked between 100 and 130.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>And Eduard Ranghiuc of football-rankings.info has been in touch with an incredibly detailed list of the top ranking-based shocks. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only result to come close to the Greece v Faroe Islands is a 1996 friendly between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Italy, which B-H won 2-1,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe former Yugoslav country was 170, while Italy were fifth. Thus a gap of 165 spots.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Eduard\xe2\x80\x99s list reveals that the biggest shock in a competitive fixture involving a team in Fifa\xe2\x80\x99s top 10 is Niger\xe2\x80\x99s 1-0 win over Egypt (No154 v No9) in October 2010, while the biggest shock featuring a team at No1 in the rankings came earlier this year when Poland (ranked No70) beat Germany last month.</p> KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth was the Mercantile Credit Football Festival?\xe2\x80\x9d wondered Martin Helme, apropos of not very much, back in the halcyon days of 2008.</p> <p>Destined for a dusty shelf next to the Watney Cup, the Texaco Cup and the Anglo-Scottish Cup, the little-known Mercantile Credit Football Festival was part of the Football League\xe2\x80\x99s spectacular centenary celebrations in 1988. Played at Wembley over the weekend of April 16 and April 17, it involved 16 teams battling it out in a series of 40-minute knock-out matches (a move that meant many games went to penalties - only eight goals were scored in the eight first-round matches).</p> <p>Nottingham Forest were the winners (and they proudly record that fact on their website). After swatting aside Leeds 3-0 in the first round with goals from Franz Carr, Stuart Pearce and Garry Parker, they beat Aston Villa on penalties in the quarter-final after a 0-0 draw, surprise package Tranmere on penalties in the semi-final after a thrilling 2-2 draw with goals from Carr and Neil Webb, and Sheffield Wednesday, yes, on penalties with Webb scoring the decisive spot-kick, after a goalless draw in the final - all this despite the absence of their manager, Brian Clough. In essence, the tournament turned out to be something of an elongated shoot-out - nine of the 15 ties went to spot-kicks - and the crowd dwindled from a healthy 41,500 on the first day to a miserable 17,000 on day two, but it did provide Forest with a shiny new trophy for the cabinet and \xc2\xa375,000.</p> <p>It provided the finale, if that is the right word, to nearly a year of celebratory events, one of which was a match between a Football League XI and a Rest of the World XI in August 1987. It was a game that had the Guardian spluttering in a leader column: \xe2\x80\x9cSoccer in August is not just an absurdity, it verges on the immoral.\xe2\x80\x9d The 60,000 fans that turned out at Wembley to watch two star-studded sides probably disagreed.</p> <p>Football League XI: Peter Shilton (Derby County), Richard Gough (Tottenham), Kenny Sansom (Arsenal), John McClelland (Watford), Paul McGrath (Manchester United), Liam Brady (West Ham), Bryan Robson (Manchester United), Neil Webb (Nottingham Forest), Clive Allen (Tottenham), Peter Beardsley (Liverpool), Chris Waddle (Tottenham). Substitutes: Steve Ogrizovic (Coventry), Steve Clarke (Chelsea), Pat Nevin (Everton), Osvaldo Ardiles (QPR), Norman Whiteside (Manchester United), Alan Smith (Arsenal). Manager: Bobby Robson.</p> <p>Rest of the World XI: Rinat Dasaev (USSR), Josimar (Brazil), Celso (Portugal), Julio Alberto (Spain), Glenn Hysen (Sweden), Salvatori Bagni (Italy), Thomas Berthold (West Germany), Gary Lineker (England), Michel Platini (France), Maradona (Argentina), Paulo Futre (Portugal). Substitutes: Andoni Zubizarreta (Spain), Lajos Detari (Hungary), Dragan Stojkovic (Yugoslavia), Igor Belanov (USSR), Preben Elkj\xc3\xa6r Larsen (Denmark), Lars Larsson (Sweden), Alexandre Zavarov (USSR). Manager: Terry Venables.</p> <p>For thousands more sepia-tinged questions and answers, take a trip through the Knowledge archive.</p> CAN YOU HELP? <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLast week Braga\xe2\x80\x99s forward \xc3\x89der (brilliant small name from his real name, \xc3\x89derzito) reached his 16th cap while playing for Portugal against Argentina at Old Trafford,\xe2\x80\x9d Cl\xc3\xa1udio Gameiro writes from Portugal. \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough he played a good part in the late winning goal of Rapha\xc3\xabl Guerreiro while, inadvertly, passing the ball to Ricardo Quaresma after blocking Adrien Silva\xe2\x80\x99s shot, he still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t found the net on those 16 games. Surelly there\xe2\x80\x99s got to be an worst ratio between caps and goals among other international forwards in the sports history, right?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDavid Meyler was the Republic of Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s captain last week in their 4-1 friendly win over the USA in Dublin,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Jamie Ralph. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was somewhat a surprise as Meyler was winning only his 11th cap for Ireland. This made me think \xe2\x80\x93 what player has been made captain of their country in the shortest time after their debut? Perhaps a better way of phrasing this question is: have any other players first captained their country with fewer caps than Meyler\xe2\x80\x99s 11?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSheffield Wednesday have already reached double figures for draws this season after 18 games, six of them being 0-0,\xe2\x80\x99 writes Bob O\xe2\x80\x99Mara. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be pretty easy to brand this football purgatory as boring but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the football hipsters amongst your readership wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like such a banal generalization. I expect they\xe2\x80\x99re still a long way off breaking any records but who holds the record for the most 0-0 draws in a season in English football? And would it be right to presume the lazy stereotype that an Italian side holds the record for no score draws?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn today\xe2\x80\x99s Guardian we can read: \xe2\x80\x98[Aston] Villa, who managed to arrive for a home fixture late after their coach got stuck in what Paul Lambert described as \xe2\x80\x9chorrendous traffic\xe2\x80\x9d, took the lead from their only shot on target,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d begins Robert Sleigh. \xe2\x80\x9cMy question (apart from why a team playing at home needs a bus) is this: Has a home team (other than Estonia in 1996) ever failed to turn up at a game (at a serious level of football) and what were the reasons?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your questions and answers to the lovely people at knowledge@theguardian.com.</p>'
