b'Stoke City not yachts or private jets is what matters to Peter Coates'


b'<p>Peter Coates hardly ever misses a Stoke City game but now and again he likes to take a winter break. This season, the Stoke chairman looked through the fixtures at the back end of January, weighed up the merits of a trip to Spotland on a Monday evening in the FA Cup fourth round or a holiday in Miami, and felt it was time to get away.</p> <p>Yet it was not quite as straightforward a decision as some might think and come the day of the match, Coates was wandering the streets of Miami trying to find a bar showing what was happening back in Rochdale. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first one I went in I got nowhere,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI went in the second one and it was called Linnigans. The guy was at the bar with the remote control and I said: \xe2\x80\x98What football have you got on?\xe2\x80\x99 He said: \xe2\x80\x98What do you want to watch?\xe2\x80\x99 I said: \xe2\x80\x98Rochdale-Stoke.\xe2\x80\x99 So he flicked about, found it and said he would put it on the big screen. So can you imagine, I\xe2\x80\x99m in Miami, ask for Rochdale-Stoke and there it is. There were four of us, it was happy hour as well, so the drinks were half-price. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get any better than that, does it?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Coates looks chuffed to bits telling the story. He is something of a rarity \xe2\x80\x93 an\xc2\xa0English owner of a top-flight club he grew up supporting in the city where he was born. He lives and breathes Stoke, so much so he says he has never given a second\xe2\x80\x99s thought to how much the club he paid \xc2\xa34.5m for in 2006, when he returned for a second spell eight years after being hounded out, would be worth on the market now. \xe2\x80\x9cMe and my family, we don\xe2\x80\x99t look at Stoke as a business,\xe2\x80\x9d Coates says. \xe2\x80\x9cFor us it\xe2\x80\x99s something important for the area and something we want to do.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>When Coates talks about his family, he is referring specifically to Denise, his daughter, and John, his son. Together the three of them run Bet365, the hugely successful online betting company which owns the club, employs more than 2,500 people in Stoke and announced a pre-tax profit of \xc2\xa3319m last year. The Sunday Times Rich List puts the family fortune at \xc2\xa31.2bn. Coates, sitting behind his desk at Bet365\xe2\x80\x99s offices, smiles when that figure is mentioned. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t take any notice of that sort of thing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He sounds entirely genuine. The youngest of 14 children and the son of a miner who served in the first world war, Coates was brought up by his sister, Irene, after his mother died when he was two. He has stayed in touch with his working-class roots, despite the size of his bank balance, and remains a longstanding supporter of the Labour party.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy political views haven\xe2\x80\x99t changed with greater wealth; I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they should,\xe2\x80\x9d Coates says. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m lucky enough to be able to afford whatever I want but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to own a yacht or a private jet or anything like that \xe2\x80\x93 it holds no appeal to me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like that kind of environment. It\xe2\x80\x99s not where I\xe2\x80\x99ve come from.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI grew up in a very strong Catholic family. I think there is some connection with things like that. I think government should be on the side of the poor, not the rich. Well-off people can look after themselves \xe2\x80\x93 and do. Whereas the biggest challenge for us, as a society, is what we do for the bottom 20% and how we can help them to have better lives, with education being a huge key to do that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In that context, it is not surprising Coates feels strongly about how football spends its riches, in particular the \xc2\xa35.1bn broadcast deal that kicks in from the start of the 2016-17 campaign. Coates talks about the importance of keeping ticket prices low, mentions the fact Stoke have offered their supporters free coach travel to every Premier League away game for the past two seasons and nods when it is put to him that gate receipts generally account for very little compared with other revenue streams.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think that\xe2\x80\x99s true with every football club [in the Premier League] and therefore, in my view, it gives us \xe2\x80\x93 us being football in general \xe2\x80\x93 an opportunity to make sure supporters benefit from the kind of money we\xe2\x80\x99re getting from the media,\xe2\x80\x9d Coates says. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only responsible for Stoke City, nobody will take kindly to me telling them what to do and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to. But that is our view and I hope that will happen throughout the game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Courteous and generous with his time, Coates comes across as a gentleman, yet there is a fierce determination. He raises a legitimate grievance when expressing his annoyance that Stoke, who are on course to finish in the top half for the second year running, do not get the wider recognition they deserve \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cWe suffer from being what I would call an unfashionable club\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 and he is not afraid to speak out from time to time, as he demonstrated earlier in the season when he accused referees of \xe2\x80\x9cbias towards other teams\xe2\x80\x9d and was fined \xc2\xa35,000 by the Football Association for his comments.</p> <p>Asked about Greg Dyke\xe2\x80\x99s proposals to increase the number of homegrown players in the top flight and the FA chairman\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfear\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cthe future of English football is the Premier League ends up being owned by foreigners, managed by foreigners and played by foreigners\xe2\x80\x9d, Coates delivers an interesting response.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty well over the top. I can understand him saying it but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a great exaggeration,\xe2\x80\x9d says Coates, who used to sit on the FA Council. \xe2\x80\x9cI actually think we\xe2\x80\x99re getting somewhere. We\xe2\x80\x99re trying very hard at Stoke City, we\xe2\x80\x99re desperate to produce players who will play in our first team. We\xe2\x80\x99re spending a lot of money on it, as is every other club. It\xe2\x80\x99s actually working. There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt, technically, our young players are getting better. I think we overdo the doom and gloom about these things. Frankly, we messed up in Brazil. Did we make the most of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve got? Not by a million miles. South Africa, I was there, the same thing. So have we made the most of the\xc2\xa0player pool we\xe2\x80\x99ve had? I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve\xc2\xa0underachieved.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Growing foreign ownership is an interesting subject to broach with Coates, especially with Stoke visiting Chelsea on Saturday. Unless Roman Abramovich breaks with tradition, the Chelsea owner will not be joining Coates in the boardroom before the game. Coates has no qualms with that and makes the point that the Russian \xe2\x80\x9ctakes a great interest in the club\xe2\x80\x9d and watches the majority of matches, which is not the case with everyone else.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI have met [Abramovich] but he normally keeps himself to himself on a matchday; he has his own little area,\xe2\x80\x9d Coates says. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can tell clubs what to do. You get owners now that you don\xe2\x80\x99t see much of: Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool to name but three. That\xe2\x80\x99s because of foreign ownership but they have their man in place, I get on perfectly well with the guys they\xe2\x80\x99ve got there and you have to accept it for what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It not surprising to learn that some of the Stoke fans who turned on Coates in his first spell, when the club was relegated to the third tier, have personally apologised and thanked him for what he has done since returning. Coates estimates his family have put \xc2\xa380m in over the past nine years and, although the motive for owning Stoke is not financial, Coates is pleased the club is moving towards become self-sustaining. \xe2\x80\x9cThe last set of accounts, I believe, will show we\xe2\x80\x99re collectively in surplus, so that\xe2\x80\x99s a big turnaround.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Surveying the wider picture, Coates says that the financial fairplay rules introduced by Uefa and the Premier League have been a force for good and helped to curb a culture of wild overspending that left most clubs in the red. \xe2\x80\x9cTo have the richest league in the world and these losses, that\xe2\x80\x99s got to be pretty stupid by any yardstick,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cSo it\xe2\x80\x99s good it\xe2\x80\x99s turned round, so it should and so it should remain.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Stoke continue to evolve on and off the field. One of the biggest decisions Coates, his son, John, and Tony Scholes, the chief executive, have made as a board was to part company with Tony Pulis a little under two years ago. Coates insists criticism of Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s style of football was never a factor and says the two of them remain extremely close. \xe2\x80\x9cWe just thought it was time for a change and I think it was a good judgment call. I also think that it\xe2\x80\x99s worked brilliantly for Tony. He performed a miracle at Crystal Palace and now he\xe2\x80\x99s the go-to man \xe2\x80\x93 if you\xe2\x80\x99re in trouble, give Tony a ring.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mark Hughes was appointed as Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s replacement and the extended contract, running until 2019, that the Welshman signed last week provides a measure of how highly he is regarded at Stoke. Just how far they can go under Hughes is an interesting question. Coates agrees with the manager that Stoke could get to a point where they reach a glass ceiling, although he stresses they are not there yet. \xe2\x80\x9cSouthampton are showing that clubs can get there and compete,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we could have a season like that, we\xe2\x80\x99d be as pleased as they are. You might even talk about us a\xc2\xa0bit more.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Coates\xe2\x80\x99s own story is certainly worthy of being told and includes some fascinating tales from his childhood and the remarkable life his father lived. After signing up with the York &amp; Lancaster Regiment, Leonard Coates fought in the battles at Loos, Arras and Vimy Ridge during the first world war and was awarded the Military Medal for holding up a German advance with a machine gun.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI talk about the inequalities of this society we live in. My dad fought in the first world war, goes back into the mines, he was on the General Strike in 1926 and he got fined for picking coal on the tips. Can you believe it? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ve told that story before but it\xe2\x80\x99s true. Extraordinary, really, that that could happen, and it was a \xe2\x80\x98land fit for heroes\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, referencing the prime minister David Lloyd George\xe2\x80\x99s pledge in the 1918 election campaign.</p> <p>It is tempting to wonder what Coates\xe2\x80\x99s father would think if he could see what his son has achieved. Not that Coates wants to shout about his success. He is more than happy for Denise and John to take the credit \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re the stars, not me\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 while quietly going about his business, just as he did on that day in Miami, when the barman in Linnigans had no idea that he was turning the TV over so that one of the wealthiest men in Britain could watch his favourite football team. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was oblivious, and the game didn\xe2\x80\x99t register with him at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Coates says. \xe2\x80\x9cRochdale-Stoke, there it is. It did make me smile.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
