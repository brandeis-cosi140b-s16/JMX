b'<p>Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s hopes of having Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 back for Saturday evening\xe2\x80\x99s title showdown with Chelsea could depend on the lottery of a drawing of lots should Ivory Coast finish level on points in their Africa Cup of Nations group on Wednesday.</p> <p>After four 1-1 draws in Equatorial Guinea, all the teams in Group D stand on two points and have each scored twice and conceded two goals.</p> <p>Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s side face Cameroon in Malabo while Guinea take on Mali in Mongomo, at 7pm local time on Wednesday. If Ivory Coast draw with Cameroon then whatever occurs in the other match, the Elephants and Indomitable Lions will finish with the same points, goals scored and goals conceded, meaning these criteria cannot be used to decide who progresses. According to regulation 74.1.4 of the Confederation of African Football\xe2\x80\x99s tournament rulebook \xe2\x80\x9ca drawing of lots conducted by the organising committee\xe2\x80\x9d would then be used to separate the nations.</p> <p>If all four of Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Guinea and Mali end with the same record then the regulations again say a drawing of lots conducted by the organising committee will be deployed.</p> <p>Since Tour\xc3\xa9 departed for the competition earlier this month City\xe2\x80\x99s form has faltered, Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s side failing to win any of their three subsequent matches and losing 2-0 to Middlesbrough at the Etihad in the FA Cup on Saturday, six days after going down by the same score to Arsenal in the league, also at home.</p> <p>While City have yet to confirm officially that plans are in place to bring Tour\xc3\xa9 back should Ivory Coast be knocked out, given the team\xe2\x80\x99s poor record without him and the need to beat Chelsea at Stamford Bridge to reduce the leaders\xe2\x80\x99 five-point advantage to two, it would be a major surprise if they did not.</p> <p>Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s Ivory Coast team-mate Wilfried Bony, signed for \xc2\xa325m in the current window but who has yet to play for City due to playing in Africa, may also join his international captain should he return for the Chelsea game.</p>'
