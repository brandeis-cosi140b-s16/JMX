b'BITTEN BY LIONS <p>Are you sitting comfortably? The Fiver isn\xe2\x80\x99t. This chair is a bit rough on the, you know, \xe2\x80\x9ctailbone\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 all foam, no support and a steadily increasing volume of nagging pain. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost as if someone doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want us sitting here for all that long \xe2\x80\x93 but that would be silly. What we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give now for our nice, firm, homely chair back at the Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s hovel. That chair knows our contours like no other. It has never injured us or caused us harm. What will our loved ones do when they know we\xe2\x80\x99ve been hurt by someone else\xe2\x80\x99s painful chair?</p> <p>Perhaps they\xe2\x80\x99ll look to Brendan Rodgers for advice because Brendan ain\xe2\x80\x99t happy. Having left the warm bosom of Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s intricately crafted training regime at Melwood, Daniel Sturridge ventured out into the wild west of the Three Lions and promptly came a cropper. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re obviously disappointed because we feel it was an injury which could have been prevented,\xe2\x80\x9d frowned Brendan Rodgers down a phone line to TalkSport, your go-to shoulder to cry on and ours.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDisappointed\xe2\x80\x9d being PR speak for \xe2\x80\x9cpretty darn hacked off\xe2\x80\x9d, we can deduce that Rodgers is pretty miffed to be missing his perennial second-most-maverick forward for the next three weeks or so. \xe2\x80\x9cFast players would have a second-day recovery while other players can work on that day,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you are that type of player like Daniel Sturridge, Raheem Sterling and boys like Danny Welbeck you need to recover them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>All of which points fairly deliberately to a disjoin between Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s and England\xe2\x80\x99s medical departments, who you would have assumed were in fairly regular contact. Gags about the latter being headed up by ex-Arsenal staff aside, it\xe2\x80\x99s another example of the fine line that both sides are walking in managing their own interests. You might say that Rodgers has crossed it one way in mentioning Welbeck \xe2\x80\x93 Welbeck is not his player and seemed to handle his schedule pretty capably in galloping past the Swiss repeatedly on Monday night and scoring twice. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 place to advise on his match preparation.</p> <p>But the issue is still there and it boils down to the growing control-freakery of clubs in allowing anyone external to do \xe2\x80\xa6 well \xe2\x80\xa6 anything that involves them. Sturridge has picked up knocks on a fairly regular basis in the past couple of years \xe2\x80\x93 and this is admittedly not the first of them to have been picked up on international duty \xe2\x80\x93 and clearly needs handling with some care but it seems presumptuous to suggest that England\xe2\x80\x99s (apparent) reluctance to subscribe to a certain theory about recovery is the cause of all woes. The undercurrent, as ever, is that clubs would really rather spare their players the rigours of international football \xe2\x80\x93 and the hands of an outside physio.</p> <p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s understandable. But perhaps we should trust the tale more than the teller when we listen to Rodgers skirt around the bigger issue here. The international calendar could do with revisions, and there is a discussion to be had, but footballers will pick up knocks, no matter who is looking after them.\xe2\x80\xa2</p> <p>That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly how your fidgetty Fiver is philosophising this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s backside-eroding indignation in its more zen-like moments. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s not the chair that\xe2\x80\x99s hurting us after all; maybe \xe2\x80\x93 and this won\xe2\x80\x99t surprise you \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s just too much sitting.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY I <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf I had not been away, Welbeck would not have signed\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger confirms what Arsenal fans have thought for a long, long time: that the purse strings are a little looser when he\xe2\x80\x99s not in town.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY II <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard him say a single thing about football worth remembering, whether in public or in private\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Jorge Valdano, who knows a thing or two about saying things worth remembering, uses Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho as cannon fodder to help flog his new booky wook.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel.

According to his interview in the Guardian way back, by his own account: \xe2\x80\x9cYou should have seen me at 16. One of those bad boys, running with a gang, trying to look cool and act hard. I thought I was a tough guy, stealing or scaring people with my friends.\xe2\x80\x9d He should get on well in football management. With [Nasty] Leeds anyway\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Charles Antaki.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLike many of your readers, I too have found Mexican cookery classes to be a let down. I actually managed to cook up some pretty good tortilla chips, but when I picked up the bowl of warm, yellow, dairy-based sauce to drizzle over the top, the instructor grabbed it from my hands, telling me I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to use it. When I asked why not, he replied \xe2\x80\x98because that is nacho cheese\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Aidan Grant.</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
