b'How your club did in the 2014 summer transfer window'


b'Arsenal <p>Arsenal solved their striking problem with a last-gasp deal for Danny Welbeck, but otherwise wasted little time in getting their major business done, with Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez, Mathieu Debuchy and David Ospina all coming in shortly after impressive World Cup showings. They were joined by the young defender Calum Chambers, who joined the Southampton exodus. While S\xc3\xa1nchez clearly added to the attack, Debuchy and Ospina were effectively replacements for Bacary Sagna, who joined Manchester City on a Bosman, and Lukasz Fabianski, who made a similar move to Swansea. Thomas Vermaelen\xe2\x80\x99s move to Barcelona pushed Chambers closer to the first-team. Nicklas Bendtner and Johan Djourou were among other long-serving players to finally depart.</p> Aston Villa <p>Paul Lambert moved quickly to enlist Premier League experience, with the free agents Philippe Senderos and Joe Cole both arriving in June. They were joined by Kieran Richardson, from relegated Fulham, before bigger money was spent on the Valencia left-back Aly Cissokho \xe2\x80\x93 on loan at Liverpool last season \xe2\x80\x93 and the impressive Colombia midfielder, Carlos S\xc3\xa1nchez, who signed from the Spanish side Elche. High-profile outgoings were few although Marc Albrighton, Nathan Delfouneso and Jordan Bowery, none of whom quite made it at Villa Park, all left for pastures new.</p> Burnley <p>Burnley needed to strengthen after gaining promotion with a modestly sized squad and brought in 10 players \xe2\x80\x93 among them Michael Kightly, who made permanent his loan from Stoke. The value of Matt Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s top-flight experience has already been seen this season while Lukas Jutkiewicz, from Middlesbrough, is a commanding presence up front. Steven Reid and Stephen Ward also bring valuable knowhow. Deadline day brought three arrivals, with Hull forward George Boyd, Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Nathaniel Chalobah and Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s Michael Keane \xe2\x80\x93 the latter two on loan for the season \xe2\x80\x93 joining Sean Dyche\xe2\x80\x99s side. Departures have been confined to fringe players such as David Edgar, Junior Stanislas and Keith Treacy.</p> Chelsea <p>A late move for Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my, to replace Fernando Torres \xe2\x80\x93 who has joined Milan on loan \xe2\x80\x93 was Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s final activity. All other signings were made well before the season, with Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas, Diego Costa, Filipe Lu\xc3\xads and the returning Didier Drogba all onboard by the end of July. Outgoings included farewells to Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole, the departures of strikers Demba Ba, Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o and Romelu Lukaku and a \xc2\xa350m move to Paris St-Germain for centre-back David Luiz. Chelsea also have 15 or so players out on loan,</p> Crystal Palace <p>Neil Warnock\xe2\x80\x99s arrival sparked some late dealings at Selhurst Park, the winger Wilfried Zaha returning on a season\xe2\x80\x99s loan from Manchester United before Zeki Fryers arrived from Spurs, Kevin Doyle signed from Wolves on loan and midfielder James McArthur joined from Wigan on deadline day. Fraizer Campbell, Brede Hangeland and Martin Kelly had already been brought in under the auspices of the former manager Tony Pulis. Jonathan Parr, Danny Gabbidon, Jose Campana, Kagisho Dikgakoi and Dean Moxey all left south-east London for pastures new.</p> Everton <p>Romelu Lukaku\xe2\x80\x99s club record \xc2\xa328m switch ensured that the Belgian, a huge success on loan from Chelsea last season, was at Goodison Park to stay; his arrival followed that of another popular loanee, Gareth Barry, whose transfer from Manchester City was made permanent. The Bosnian midfielder Muhamed Besic also signed after the World Cup while the Ghanaian winger Christian Atsu is this season\xe2\x80\x99s temporary arrival from Stamford Bridge. Last week saw Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o join on a free transfer. Apostolos Vellios and Magaye Gueye were the only departures of much note.</p> Hull City <p>A lengthy search for a striker culminated in the signature of the Palermo forward Abel Hern\xc3\xa1ndez for \xc2\xa39.5m on deadline day. Steve Bruce also signed midfielder Mohamed Diam\xc3\xa9 and completed a loans for Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s Gast\xc3\xb3n Ram\xc3\xadrez and Newcastle outcast Hatem Ben Arfa late on, with other deals including Michael Dawson, Tom Ince, Robert Snodgrass and last season\xe2\x80\x99s loanee, Jake Livermore. Harry Maguire and Andrew Robertson are promising defensive signings from Sheffield United and Hearts. Shane Long\xe2\x80\x99s move to Southampton was what originally left them short up top, while others to depart included George Boyd, Matty Fryatt, Robert Koren and Nick Proschwitz.</p> Leicester City <p>Esteban Cambiasso, the decorated Argentina midfielder, was Nigel Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s most high-profile signing but not the most expensive, with his compatriot Leonardo Ulloa arriving from Brighton for \xc2\xa38m. The veteran defender Matthew Upson also joined from the Seagulls, with the winger Marc Albrighton, right-back Danny Simpson and deadline day signing Tom Lawrence the other significant names to arrive. Few departed the King Power Stadium although Sean St Ledger, Zak Whitbread, Neil Danns and, perhaps most notably, Lloyd Dyer all left on free transfers.</p> Liverpool <p>Liverpool were determined early movers, with Emre Can joining the Southampton pair Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana at Anfield by early July. Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa375m departure to Barcelona then prompted further eight-figure moves for Lazar Markovic, Dejan Lovren \xe2\x80\x93 a third arrival from the Saints \xe2\x80\x93 Divock Origi, Alberto Moreno and, last week, Mario Balotelli. Daniel Agger\xe2\x80\x99s return to Brondby was perhaps the most surprising of their other departures, although Pepe Reina secured the most high-profile move with a switch to Bayern Munich.</p> Manchester City <p>City concentrated on strengthening their defence during the summer, with a protracted \xc2\xa332m move for the Porto centre-back Eliaquim Mangala finally completed in August and Bacary Sagna coming in at right-back after his Arsenal contract expired. Mangala\xe2\x80\x99s Porto team-mate, the defensive midfielder Fernando, also joined \xe2\x80\x93 as well as the experienced Malaga goalkeeper Willy Cabellero. Those moving out included Joleon Lescott, Gareth Barry, Costel Pantilimon, Jack Rodwell and Javi Garc\xc3\xada, with the latter pair fetching a total of \xc2\xa323m through their moves to Sunderland and Zenit St Petersburg respectively. Micah Richards made a late loan exit to Fiorentina on deadline day, and \xc3\x81lvaro Negredo made a last-ditch season-long move of his own to Valencia.</p> Manchester United <p>Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s window exploded into life late on, with a last-ditch loan deal for Radamel Falcao \xe2\x80\x93 completed in the early hours \xe2\x80\x93 coming days after a \xc2\xa313.8m move for Ajax\xe2\x80\x99s Daley Blind and a British record \xc2\xa359.7m purchase of Angel di Mar\xc3\xada. The Sporting Lisbon left-back Marcos Rojo also arrived in August, with big-money deals for Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera having been completed the previous month. Patrice Evra, Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic were the most high-profile exits, although Javier Hern\xc3\xa1ndez\xe2\x80\x99s loan move to Real Madrid raised eyebrows, Shinji Kagawa made a long-mooted return to Dortmund and Danny Welbeck completed a late, late switch to Arsenal.</p> Newcastle United <p>The Tenerife forward Ayoze P\xc3\xa9rez and midfielder Jack Colback, moving controversially from Sunderland, were the first additions of a busy summer for Alan Pardew. The Ajax forward Siem de Jong and Montpellier playmaker Remy Cabella followed, as did Monaco\xe2\x80\x99s striker Emmanuel Rivi\xc3\xa8re and the Dutch World Cup right-back Daryl Janmaat. Karl Darlow and Jamaal Lascelles were signed from Nottingham Forest and loaned back. Mathieu Debuchy was the most significant first-team departure, to Arsenal, although Shola Ameobi\xe2\x80\x99s move to Gaziantep after nearly two decades at the club seemed like the end of an era. Hatem Ben Arfa finally found somewhere to play football at the very end of the window, joining Hull on loan.</p> QPR <p>Central defence was Harry Redknapp\xe2\x80\x99s focus early on, securing Rio Ferdinand on a free transfer and the \xc2\xa38m Steven Caulker to partner him. Another player from Cardiff, the midfielder Jordon Mutch, was next through the door with Juventus\xe2\x80\x99 Mauricio Isla (loan) and Norwich\xe2\x80\x99s Leroy Fer adding to QPR\xe2\x80\x99s options. Sandro\xe2\x80\x99s move from Spurs on deadline day gave the midfield a more steely look, and Niko Kranjcar also re-signed at the last. The forward Eduardo Vargas joined his fellow Chilean Isla on loan from Napoli for the season, while Jack Robinson and the goalkeeper Alex McCarthy arrived from Liverpool and Reading respectively. Passing through a predictably busy exit door were the likes of St\xc3\xa9phane Mbia, Danny Simpson, Esteban Granero, Gary O\xe2\x80\x99Neil and Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my.</p> Southampton <p>Few clubs lost as many first-teamers as Southampton, Rickie Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s move to Liverpool setting the ball rolling and Adam Lallana swiftly joining him for \xc2\xa325m. Luke Shaw ensured the summer continued to be profitable, joining Manchester United for up to \xc2\xa331m, and Dejan Lovren\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa320m switch to Liverpool made it a hat-trick of departures to Anfield. Calum Chambers\xe2\x80\x99 switch to Arsenal completed the departures. Gast\xc3\xb3n Ram\xc3\xadrez\xe2\x80\x99s late loan to Hull was less keenly felt. The Saints\xe2\x80\x99 summer earnings have been reinvested in Dusan Tadic, Graziano Pelle, Fraser Forster, Florin Gardos, last-gasp deadline day signings Toby Alderweireld and Sadio Man\xc3\xa9, and the \xc2\xa312m Shane Long.</p> Stoke City <p>The headline signing was the Barcelona forward and one-time prodigy Bojan Krkic, who joined the former Manchester United striker \xe2\x80\x93 and conqueror of Manchester City \xe2\x80\x93 Mame Biram Diouf in Mark Hughes\xe2\x80\x99 revamped frontline. Captures of Phil Bardsley and Steve Sidwell, from Sunderland and Fulham, were more workmanlike. The Brazilian defender Dionatan Teixeira, from the Slovak side Dukla Bansla Bystrica, is one for the future. They made a deadline day signing in the winger Oussama Assaidi, whose loan from Liverpool was resurrected. There were few high-profile outgoings, although Michael Kightly firmed up his move to Burnley while Cameron Jerome moved to Norwich and Matthew Etherington was released.</p> Sunderland <p>Gus Poyet made two loan additions on deadline day Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Sebastian Coates and Inter Milan midfielder Ricky \xc3\x81lvarez both arriving for the season. He had already strengthened the spine of his side with two newcomers from Manchester City, midfielder Jack Rodwell and goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon, also returning to his former club Brighton for the winger Will Buckley. West Bromwich\xe2\x80\x99s defender Billy Jones, Wigan\xe2\x80\x99s playmaker Jordi G\xc3\xb3mez and the Chelsea left-back Patrick van Aanholt were their other major newcomers. The more notable names in a sizeable number of exits were Craig Gardner, who swapped clubs with Jones, Phil Bardsley, Jack Colback, Carlos Cu\xc3\xa9llar and Andrea Dossena.</p> Swansea City <p>It was a busy window for Garry Monk and Swansea, who brought in Lukasz Fabianski from Arsenal before May had finished and followed that with a move for the Fraance striker Bafetimbi Gomis. Gylfi Sigurdsson, returning from Spurs, and Ecuadorian winger Jefferson Monteiro came in for significant sums, while Napoli defender Federico Fernandez and another old boy, Marvin Emnes, also signed on. Tom Carroll also joined from Spurs on loan. Ben Davies and Michel Vorm, both heading to White Hart Lane, were notable departures while Chico Flores and Pablo Hern\xc3\xa1ndez opted to try their luck in Qatar. Jos\xc3\xa9 Ca\xc3\xb1as made a late move back to Spain with Espanyol.</p> Tottenham Hotspur <p>Spurs prioritised defence in their recruitment, signing the left-back Ben Davies and goalkeeper Michel Vorm from Swansea in July before adding the English-born Eric Dier from Sporting Lisbon. The attacking right-back DeAndre Yedlin, from Seattle Sounders, has agreed to join in 2015 after the MLS season. Federico Fazio, the 6ft 5in Seville centre-back, seems to have completed Mauricio Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s reshaping of the backline although defensive midfielder Benjamin Stambouli was a solid deadline day addition from Montpellier. Gylfi Sigurdsson, the captain Michael Dawson, Zeki Fryers and Jake Livermore all left, while Heurelho Gomes was released and moved to Watford.</p> West Bromwich Albion <p>Alan Irvine\xe2\x80\x99s rebuilding job went right to the end of the window, with the Porto winger Silvestre Varela joining on loan and another attack-minded player, Sebasti\xc3\xa1n Blanco, joining from Metalist Kharkiv. Craig Gardner and Joleon Lescott had both already signed after leaving Sunderland and Manchester City, and were joined by Sebastien Pocognoli, Jason Davidson, Giorgos Samaras, Costa Rica\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup wing-back Cristian Gamboa, Andre Wisdom (loan) and the \xc2\xa310m striker Brown Ideye. Chief among the departures were Steven Reid, Liam Ridgewell, Diego Lugano, Billy Jones, Zoltan Gera and George Thorne.</p> West Ham United <p>Sam Allardyce\xe2\x80\x99s move to a more technical style has seen Mauro Z\xc3\xa1rate, the Ecuador World Cup revelation Enner Valencia, Diego Poyet, Alex Song and, most recently, Morgan Amalfitano all come through the door at Upton Park. He has also changed his full-backs, with Ipswich\xe2\x80\x99s Aaron Cresswell and Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Carl Jenkinson, the latter on loan, arriving. Cheikou Kouyate adds midfield steel and the striker Diafra Sakho, from Metz, further bolsters the frontline. Modibo Maiga swapped places with Sakho on loan. Joe Cole, Jack Collison, George McCartney and Matthew Taylor all departed on free transfers.</p>'
