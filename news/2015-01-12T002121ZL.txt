b'<p>Lionel Messi has denied that he demanded Barcelona sack their manager, Luis Enrique, and says he has no intention of leaving the club, describing reports linking him to Chelsea or Manchester City as \xe2\x80\x9clies\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>At the end of a week of crisis Messi broke his silence on the club\xe2\x80\x99s TV channel after Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s 3-1 victory over Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI have never demanded anything to stay because I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any intention of going,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard people say that my dad had spoken to Chelsea, to City \xe2\x80\xa6 it\xe2\x80\x99s all lies.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI heard all sorts of things said. I never come out and deny [stories] but this time I am. It has been said that I have pushed out lots of people \xe2\x80\xa6 Eto\xe2\x80\x99o, Ibrahimovic, Bojan, Guardiola \xe2\x80\xa6 [and] I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask them to sack our manager.</p>  <p> Related: Lionel Messi helps Barcelona unite to avert a crisis \xe2\x80\xa6 for now | Sid Lowe </p>   <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not good for people to look for rivalry between me and Luis Enrique because there isn\xe2\x80\x99t any,\xe2\x80\x9d Messi added.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt hurts because it comes from people who [supposedly] love Barcelona. It\xe2\x80\x99s people who want to hurt the club \xe2\x80\x93 and this time it did not come from Madrid, like other times, it has come from here. I have heard lots of things being said about me before and now. They make it look like I am the one who is in charge here when I am just another player.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t throw shit at us from outside because that will only do us harm.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
