b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini hopes CSKA Moscow have learned a lesson concerning last season\xe2\x80\x99s racial abuse of Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 after Manchester City were again drawn against the Russian club in the Champions League group stages. During City\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 win at the Khimki Arena in October 2013, Tour\xc3\xa9 suffered monkey chants.</p> <p>Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cI hope for Moscow it is a lesson that they learn about that and hope that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have any problems, not only with Yaya. I remember what happened last year. The pitch was also a problem, we played on a very bad pitch.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Tour\xc3\xa9 said at the time: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not just disappointed, I\xe2\x80\x99m furious. I\xe2\x80\x99m very disappointed about what those fans have done and I think Uefa have to take action because players with the same colour of skin will always be in the same position. For me, as captain, I was wearing an armband which said \xe2\x80\x98No to racism\xe2\x80\x99 and I was totally disappointed.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI want to see Uefa do something and take some action. We have to be as strong as possible, otherwise they will continue like that. Maybe they could ban the stadium, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, for a couple of years or a couple of months.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Regarding a draw that also placed City with Bayern Munich for a third time in four years, Pellgrini said: It is a similar group to last year and it is a difficult group, especially with Roma. We must play and try to qualify, Some groups are less difficult, but that is not a problem.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there is a better system than they use now for the Champions League. One team can be more difficult than another one, but when we were at M\xc3\xa1laga, everybody wanted to play us, but we won the group. I reached a semi-final with Villarreal and a quarter-final with M\xc3\xa1laga, so it shows that not always the biggest teams can do well.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t just think about the Champions League. We want to win the Premier League this year, too, but we also want to improve in Europe. The seeding is not a problem. It is the rules of the draw.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The manager also confirmed that Micah Richards, Scott Sinclair and John Guidetti can leave. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will see what happens with them in the next 48 hours,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey know they are not part of the squad because we have enough players with the 22 players I chose for this year.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
