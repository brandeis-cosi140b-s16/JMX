Manchester United were professional and pretty, while Cambridge were resilient and determined, as they had to be to limit the biggest club in the country to three goals. But they\xe2\x80\x99ll always wonder what might have happened had Tom Elliott found the net on 51 seconds. Ah well, they\xe2\x80\x99ll always have that 0-0 draw at the Abbey.</p>'
