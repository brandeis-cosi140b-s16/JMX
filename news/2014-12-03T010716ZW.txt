b'What\xe2\x80\x99s the lowest a team has finished while winning the Champions League?'


b'<p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn light of Borussia Dortmund\xe2\x80\x99s Jekyll and Hyde performances in the Champions League and Bundesliga my housemate and I were wondering - what\xe2\x80\x99s the lowest a team has ever finished whilst in the same season also winning one of the two major European trophies?\xe2\x80\x9d Oliver de Hoest wonders. \xe2\x80\x9cHas any team ever been relegated?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Poor old Borussia Dortmund. They are bottom of the Bundesliga and now The Knowledge has to put its sympathetic face on and reveal that no side has ever won the European Cup and been relegated in the same season \xe2\x80\x93 although in 2006 Juventus reached the last eight of the Champions League and were then relegated in the Calciopoli scandal \xe2\x80\x93 so Dortmund should probably sort their domestic form out sharpish if they plan on lifting the trophy this season.</p> <p>It is hardly a surprise that European champions fare well in the league \xe2\x80\x93 for instance, the lowest Real Madrid have ever finished in La Liga when winning one of their 10 European Cups is fifth in the 1999-00 season. In England, Liverpool finished fifth in 2005 and Chelsea were sixth in 2012, but Manchester United were champions in 1999 and 2008.</p> <p>However there have been a couple of poor performances. Bayern Munich finished 10th in the Bundesliga and won the European Cup in 1974-75 but that is not quite as bad as Aston Villa, who finished 11th in Division One when they became champions of Europe in 1982.</p> <p>Over to the Uefa Cup, then, and the lowest-placed team to win it were Internazionale in 1994. They finished 13th in Serie A. Elsewhere Tottenham finished 6th in 1972 and 8th in 1984, Borussia Monchedgladbach finished 10th in 1979, Eintracht Frankfurt finished 9th in 1980, Bayer Leverkusen finished 8th in 1988 and Schalke finished 12th in 1997.</p> <p>Ipswich Town were relegated from the Premier League in 2002 and so were Blackburn Rovers in 1999 but both were eliminated early from the Uefa Cup, while Wigan Athletic and Birmingham City were both relegated from the Premier League after qualifying for the Europa League in 2013 and 2011 respectively.</p> GOALS TO CAPS RATIOS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLast month Braga\xe2\x80\x99s forward \xc3\x89der (brilliant small name from his real name, \xc3\x89derzito) reached his 16th cap while playing for Portugal against Argentina at Old Trafford,\xe2\x80\x9d Cl\xc3\xa1udio Gameiro writes from Portugal. \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough he played a good part in the late winning goal of Rapha\xc3\xabl Guerreiro while, inadvertly, passing the ball to Ricardo Quaresma after blocking Adrien Silva\xe2\x80\x99s shot, he still hasn\xe2\x80\x99t found the net on those 16 games. Surely there\xe2\x80\x99s got to be a worse ratio between caps and goals among other international forwards in the sports history, right?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Well we immediately thought of Andy Cole\xe2\x80\x99s quest to score his first goal for England. He made his England debut in a friendly against Uruguay in 1995 but was used sparingly from then on and it took him until 2001 to break his duck for his country, scoring his first goal in a World Cup qualifier against Albania. It was his 13th appearance for England and that was his only goal. Meanwhile he was busily winning titles and the Champions League for Manchester United. Well done, England! Good work!</p> <p>But, no, the answer is not Andy Cole, so let\xe2\x80\x99s see what our readers have to offer. \xe2\x80\x9cIn regards to Claudio Gameiro\xe2\x80\x99s question, one of the least successful (or unluckiest, depending on your view of him) players to play during Australian football\xe2\x80\x99s most successful era has to be Scott McDonald,\xe2\x80\x9d says Andrew Thomas. \xe2\x80\x9cThe former Celtic goal poacher, now of Milwall, banged in 51 goals in 88 games for The Bhoys. He earned 26 caps for the Socceroos but in all those games he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t replicate even a skerrick of the touch in front of goal he showed for The Hoops, failing to snag a single sausage roll while wearing the national colours.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAnd to put his duck egg into perspective, he started games against the likes of the mighty Qatar, Iraq, South Africa, Bahrain, New Zealand and United Arab Emirates. And came on as a substitute against Kuwait and India. All without troubling the scorer. At the other end of the pitch we\xe2\x80\x99ve got Mark Schwarzer who notched up 109 caps without a goal.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAnd spare a thought for Lucas Neill, who either went terribly close, or had the ball in the back of the net but the goal ruled out on a number of occasions only to finally get his one and only international goal in his 91st of 96 appearances for the Socceroos.</p> <p>Ciaran Hannigan-Purcell also has an answer. \xe2\x80\x9cSpare a thought for New Zealand and Wellington Phoenix winger Jeremy Brockie,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cBrockie scored his first goal for his national team against Uzbekistan on the 9th of September this year - in his forty-fifth and most recent cap. All this despite being a reasonably effective player in the A-League, netting 37 in 122 games.</p> <p>And so does Mitchell Ankers: \xe2\x80\x9cFormer Portsmouth forward Mladen Rudonja only managed one goal in 65 caps for Slovenia, perhaps the worst return from a forward in international football history. However, his Wikipedia article notes that he was a fan favourite who was predominantly a \xe2\x80\x98defensive forward\xe2\x80\x99 and also spent a lot of time on the wings which may go some way to explaining why he continued to be picked despite his lack of goals. The goal he did score was also quite important as it secured their qualification for the 2002 World Cup.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> SPEEDY INTERNATIONAL CAPTAINS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDavid Meyler was the Republic of Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s captain last month in their 4-1 friendly win over the USA in Dublin,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Jamie Ralph. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was somewhat a surprise as Meyler was winning only his 11th cap for Ireland. This made me think \xe2\x80\x93 what player has been made captain of their country in the shortest time after their debut? Perhaps a better way of phrasing this question is: have any other players first captained their country with fewer caps than Meyler\xe2\x80\x99s 11?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Well, an obvious answer would be Gibraltar\xe2\x80\x99s captain, Roy Chipolina, who captained them in their first Uefa international against Slovakia last year. But on that basis, the answer would be everyone who captained their country in their first ever match and that would be quite boring.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn the Caribbean, on numerous occasions, players have captained their sides on debut,\xe2\x80\x9d says Adam Sbovda. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo that spring to mind are Anthony Griffith (then of Port Vale), who captained Montserrat in the first match of 2014 World Cup qualifying, against Belize on 15 June 2011 and David Abdul (then of Sparta Rotterdam), who captained Aruba the following month in their victory over Saint Lucia in the same tournament.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMore recently, Charlton Vicento was made captain on his debut for Cura\xc3\xa7ao against Martinique in the Caribbean Cup. Vicento was sent off moments before his side equalized in the final minute of the match, which ended 1-1. Martinique\xe2\x80\x99s scorer that day was Julien Faubert, who was also making his debut for his side. Faubert was able to represent \xe2\x80\x98Les Matinino\xe2\x80\x99 because they are not FIFA-affiliated (only CONCACAF-affiliated), and had also scored on his debut (and only appearance) for France in 2006. I wonder how many players can say they scored on two separate international debuts?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>According to this link, Alfredo di Stefano is the answer to that question, Adam, having done so for Argentina and Spain.</p> <p>But on we go. \xe2\x80\x9cIn 2005, midfielder Rasmus W\xc3\xbcrtz of Danish club AaB Aalborg made his international debut in an away game against Finland,\xe2\x80\x9d Kristian Enstr\xc3\xb8m says. \xe2\x80\x9cW\xc3\xbcrtz, who was the Danish Under-21 captain at the time, replaced captain Jon-Dahl Tomasson, and was going to handover the captain\xe2\x80\x99s armband to Thomas Gravesen, the vice-captain. However, Gravesen rejected the armband and told W\xc3\xbcrtz to put it on himself, which made W\xc3\xbcrtz the captain in his debut for the national team.</p> <p>Steven Hyde has another suggestion. \xe2\x80\x9cInterestingly, both Scott Parker and Aaron Ramsey captained their respective home nations on their 11th appearances for the country,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cCraig Levein captained Scotland on either his 11th or 12th appearance (16 caps overall, was captain once in late 1993 and won four caps in 1994, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t find any more specific references) \xe2\x80\x93 if we can find a Northern Irishman to complete the set, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the foundations of a truly remarkable pub quiz question</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, none of these are anywhere near the fewest caps received by a captain \xe2\x80\x93 Gerry Francis captained England on eight of the 12 occasions he turned out for them, meaning he must have been captain on at most his fifth appearance. There are numerous pre-war England captains who better this, my favourites being Basil Patchitt (1923) and Cuthbert Ottaway (1872-74), both of whom made two appearances and captained the team on both occasions.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>And finally, we hear from Ian Williams. \xe2\x80\x9cSouth Africa\xe2\x80\x99s Matthew Booth captained the nation in only his fifth match - they beat Mozambique 3-0 in April 2001, in the Cosafa Cup,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the time, Booth was on the books of Wimbledon, although he never played a competitive match for them. It was his sole game as captain, though he had led the Under-23 side to the Sydney Olympics the previous year. The team against Mozambique also included Aaron Mokoena, who led the team in the disastrous 2010 World Cup campaign. He captained the side 63 times.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHas a footballer ever been arrested on the field of play?\xe2\x80\x9d Phillip Brown asked in 2008.</p> <p>In 2005, police swooped on the Quilmes defender Leandro Des\xc3\xa1bato at the final whistle of his team\xe2\x80\x99s 3-1 Copa Libertadores defeat to S\xc3\xa3o Paulo. Des\xc3\xa1bato, it was alleged, had racially slandered opposition striker Grafite and was summarily hauled off to a local police station for questioning. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no need for all this chaos,\xe2\x80\x9d complained the Quilmes coach Gustavo Alfaro after the game. \xe2\x80\x9cA football match should start and finish on the pitch. This has all been handled in the wrong way. It was an unnecessary spectacle [for the police] to come on to the field in front of 50,000 or 60,000 people when the player\xe2\x80\x99s pulse-rate is still high. He\xe2\x80\x99s just lost a game.\xe2\x80\x9d Des\xc3\xa1bato was released on \xc2\xa32,000 bail after spending a night in the cells, but no charges were ever brought against him.</p> <p>The Botafogo defender Andre Luis was also dragged off the field by riot police during a Brazilian championship match at Nautico in June 2008. Luis, sent off for a second booking, reacted furiously to the decision, antagonising opposition fans and sparking a free-for-all among the players. Officers eventually arrested the defender, but not before pepper-spraying his brawling team-mates and opponents. \xe2\x80\x9cFootballers are not bandits, and are not to be kicked and punched. This has to stop,\xe2\x80\x9d raged the Botafogo president Bebeto de Freitas, who was also arrested. \xe2\x80\x9cThe player was wrong, he will be punished and suspended. What is not acceptable is for him to have pepper in his face or be prodded in the back with a truncheon.\xe2\x80\x9d Both Luis and De Freitas were released after questioning, although the player was subsequently handed a 12-match ban by the Court of Sports Justice.</p> <p>Back in England, the Droylsden FC forward Paddi Wilson also felt the long arm of the law while he was warming up ahead of an FA Trophy tie against Ashton in 2002. Greater Manchester police arrived on the scene and was accompanied to the changing rooms for questioning, before being taken to the local nick. \xe2\x80\x9cPatrick Wilson was arrested on failing to appear in court in connection with outstanding road traffic offences,\xe2\x80\x9d confirmed a spokesman for the force. Droylsden went on to win the game 2-1.</p> CAN YOU HELP? <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs we\xe2\x80\x99re approaching the festive season,\xe2\x80\x9d says Joseph Chapman, \xe2\x80\x9cit will inevitably be the case that a furious football manager will respond to a devastating result by doing what most of us pray for, and cancel the Christmas party, leaving the players to go out and get drunk with their friends instead of their colleagues. My question is, is there any evidence that cancelling the Christmas party following poor performances leads to an upswing in results?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the most Irish players that have ever started for one team in a Premier Leaugue game?\xe2\x80\x9d queries Philip Farrell.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhilst shooting the proverbial, a mate of mine raised an interesting point this morning (Friday, 28th November, 2014),\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Daniel Jackson last Friday, 28th November, 2014. As of today, the Premier League table reads:</p> <p>4: Man United</p> <p>5: Newcastle United</p> <p>6: West Ham United</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cQuestion: Is this the highest that all three \xe2\x80\x9cUniteds\xe2\x80\x9d have sat at any given time? Has there been another occasion were all three were positioned in the top six?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhile looking at the wiki for the infamous \xe2\x80\x98One Night in Tallinn\xe2\x80\x99 as linked on one of the questions in the Knowledge,\xe2\x80\x9d begins Jerome Cox-Strong. \xe2\x80\x9cI noticed that almost all of the Estonian team that day played for Flora Tallinn. Thus, my question is this: Has there ever been an entire starting line-up, or even squad, comprised entirely of players from one club, and, assuming there probably has been considering some of the smallest nations might only have one or two clubs, who\xe2\x80\x99s the highest ranked nation to have completed the feat?</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your questions and answers to the lovely people at knowledge@theguardian.com.</p>'
