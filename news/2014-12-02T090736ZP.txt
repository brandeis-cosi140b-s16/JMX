b'1) Abundant caution does no harm <p>Spurs\xe2\x80\x99 season has been an odd one \xe2\x80\x93 there\xe2\x80\x99s a sense of struggle yet they\xe2\x80\x99re two points from the top four with more than a third of the campaign gone. Perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s down to the nature of the results rather than the results themselves \xe2\x80\x93 the wins have been narrow (all but one by a single goal) and the five defeats either thumping (3-0 against Liverpool, 4-1 against Manchester City) or at White Hart Lane against teams they would expect to beat (West Brom, Newcastle and Stoke). Still, all things considered it\xe2\x80\x99s not going too badly for them and as such Tottenham will feel the need to approach Chelsea with more ambition than Sunderland did at the weekend. But should they? Sunderland have offered Mauricio Pochettino a blueprint to follow and Spurs have the players do to it \xe2\x80\x93 Ryan Mason and Nabil Bentaleb offer plenty of bite in midfield and Harry Kane has the energy and eagerness to begin the defending from the front. The idea of Audere est Facere is an admirable one but Wednesday might not be the night for it: the last time Tottenham won at Chelsea was February 1990. Perhaps abundans cautela non nocet would be a better motto for Stamford Bridge.

The defeat against QPR at the weekend means it is now eight games without a win for his Leicester side, who find themselves on the foot of the Premier League as a result. Pearson is now the runaway favourite to become the first manager to lose his job this season. But the meeting with Liverpool offers reason for optimism. Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s better performances this season have come against the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s bigger beasts \xe2\x80\x93 they gave Chelsea a scare, held both Arsenal and Everton, and klonked Manchester United 5-3 \xe2\x80\x93 and Liverpool, despite a shaky start, certainly still qualify. The Reds may have pulled themselves out of their own rut thanks to Glen Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s winner against Stoke but there was enough evidence at Anfield to suggest that Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 side are not out of their collective funk just yet. JA</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Rodgers: Gerrard weighing up new Liverpool contract\xe2\x80\xa2 Gerrard dismisses reported rift with Rodgers</p>  3) Does Alan Irvine deserve more time? <p>If you genuinely think Georgios Samaras is the answer, a cynic might suggest the managerial questions are getting a mite too difficult, so it was no surprise that the introduction of the Greek striker (no goals and no assists in 171 minutes\xe2\x80\x99 worth of substitute appearances over seven games) prompted howls of derision at The Hawthorns against Arsenal on Saturday afternoon. The natives of West Bromwich are getting restless and it seems time is running out for Alan Irvine.</p> <p>Whether or not such criticism is fair is a moot point. Critics of Brendan Rodgers have pointed out that a manager is judged on his signings but, if the Liverpool manager\xe2\x80\x99s have underwhelmed, some of those brought in by the West Brom recruitment department have been little short of disastrous. Record \xc2\xa310m signing Ideye Brown remains on the first-team fringes and has yet to score a Premier League goal while Silvestre Varela, Chris Baird, Sebasti\xc3\xa1n Blanco and Jason Davidson have also found opportunities limited after being bought or borrowed in the late, late trolley dash necessitated by a mass summer exodus.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere were no games to watch them playing in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Irvine of many of West Brom\xe2\x80\x99s signings. \xe2\x80\x9cWith some of the boys we got to see them playing in the World Cup and with others we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a chance to see them do anything. We were trying to do as much homework as we possibly can and the recruitment department knew a lot of these players from watching them for a long time but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t something I was doing. I would hope that in future transfer windows there is a much more joined-up approach than was possible in this one.\xe2\x80\x9d Quite how much input Irvine, a decent man, had in the recruitment drive he seemed so eager to distance himself from remains unclear but an improvement on one home win for the season, against resurgent West Ham, could help buy Irvine the time he needs to instigate the joined-up January approach of which he speaks. BG</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Louise Taylor: Berahino must beware fame and wealth</p>  4) Can Palace grab some breathing space? <p>The first week of December is far too early to talk about relegation six-pointers but with Crystal Palace and Aston Villa separated only by goal difference, the winners of the game in south London can at least secure some breathing space before the busy Christmas period. It was a similar story in the corresponding fixture back in March when a Palace win virtually assured safety for Tony Pulis and left Paul Lambert nervously looking over his shoulder. The Eagles are once again in good form having recovered from a shaky run under Neil Warnock, while Villa have at least stopped the rot with three straight draws. Those of a certain vintage may recall that it is now more than 30 years since a goal from Gary Shaw secured their last win at Selhurst Park on their way to the First Division title in 1980-81. How times have changed. EA</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Warnock: Growing belief drove Palace to draw at Swansea\xe2\x80\xa2 Villa\xe2\x80\x99s Cole shows appetite for \xe2\x80\x98proper games\xe2\x80\x99</p>  5) Can Sunderland continue run of home wins over the champions? <p>It is a remarkable statistic. Manchester City have contrived to lose 1-0 on each of their last four visits to the Stadium of Light, a venue that enjoyed little renown as a fortress prior to Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s splendidly disciplined performance against Chelsea on Saturday. Having conceded eight goals without reply at Southampton not so long ago, Gus Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s men became the first team to keep Chelsea scoreless in 20 matches this season. Attempting to make sense of it all is difficult but, if one is prepared to overlook Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s aberration on the south coast, they have proved difficult to beat despite occasional lapses into the realm of the slapstick. They are unbeaten in 10 of their 13 Premier League matches and it is toothlessness up front rather than porousness in defence that has cost them but they are likely to face another stern test against champions who were a pleasure to watch in victory against Southampton.</p> <p>Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s troops will have been physically and mentally drained by the intensity of their effort against Chelsea but have the luxury of an extra day to recover. City\xe2\x80\x99s players are unlikely to have been too exhausted on the back of their romp against Southampton and one can only surmise that their weird and less-than-wonderful record will play on the minds of their players. The home side are available at odds of 15-2 to win the match and over 20-1 to win it 1-0. IT couldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again, could it ... is presumably what most right-thinking folk were thinking last season and the one before.

Stoke have not gone three league games without a win since February. Something has got to give at Old Trafford (unless it is a draw, obviously, but don\xe2\x80\x99t let the details get in the way of the narrative). It might not be as straightforward for Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s side as it first appears. Under Mark Hughes Stoke have developed that happy knack of picking up wins just when required and they have already tasted victory once in Manchester this season thanks to Mame Biraf Diouf\xe2\x80\x99s winner at the Etihad at the end of August. And the Potters troubled Manchester United last season, leading twice at Old Trafford before being beaten by a Javier Hern\xc3\xa1ndez special, plus, unusually, they have been as good away from home as at the Britannia this season. If one was looking to nitpick, one might suggest that United were the beneficiaries of some ludicrously generous Hull City defending at the weekend but in truth it looks more as if they are beginning to go through the gears and Stoke were unable to hold out against an out-of-sorts Liverpool at the weekend. This should be a pattern-busting fourth win in four.

Two wins and a draw from four games have put them within touching distance of mid-table, with the goal-scoring form of Danny Ings a boon for Sean Dyche\xe2\x80\x99s side. Ings now has four goals from 10 Premier League appearances and is being linked with a transfer already \xe2\x80\x93 but can he keep it up? He scored a goal every other game last season but before that his goal-scoring record was nothing to shout about \xe2\x80\x93 a previous season high of seven league goals in 26 League One games for Bournemouth in 2010-11 is far from impressive. So, flash in the pan or just a young striker finding his shooting boots? Newcastle have conceded only two goals since the 2-2 draw with Swansea at the start of October, so this home game may provide a good indication of whether Ings can thrive against sturdier opponents or whether teams might do better to scout more seasoned goal-scoring talent.

Arsenal were well off the Premier League pace with their manager attempting to mollify impatient supporters. While it is heartwarming that one of the two clubs has advanced in leaps and bounds in the interim, having lost three from three in the Premier League against teams who finished in the top six last season, Southampton will be hoping to end their rate of failure against top sides when they travel to the Emirates on Wednesday. A win for Arsenal, by contrast, will make it three on the spin and go some way towards pacifying irate fans until the club\xe2\x80\x99s inevitable return to the edge of the abyss signposted \xe2\x80\x9cCrisis\xe2\x80\x9d. After a weekend that hinted at a return to the natural order, what with still unbeaten Chelsea being the only club of the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s generally recognised Big Six not to post a win, the sight of Ronald Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s Saints marching out of the Emirates with a win would gladden the hearts of romantics hoping for a top-four shake-up come season\xe2\x80\x99s end.

While Wilfried Bony continues to be a menace, he needs more support from those around him. Gylfi Sigurdsson, rejuvenated by his return to Wales, seemed particularly frustrated with his own contribution \xe2\x80\x93 missing a couple of half-chances to put the game beyond the visitors. After the game he pointed out that the rest of the squad must start weighing in and, if Garry Monk\xe2\x80\x99s team are to do more than survive, they need the midfielders to find the back of the net \xe2\x80\x93 Wayne Routledge, Nathan Dyer, Jefferson Montero and Sigurdsson are all capable of double figures for the season. Luckily Swansea are up against QPR on Tuesday \xe2\x80\x93 Harry Redknapp\xe2\x80\x99s team is one of the most open in the division and allowed Leicester 19 shots on goal in their 3-2 win on Saturday. If Monk\xe2\x80\x99s side need some shooting practice QPR are likely to oblige. TM</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Big interview with Wilfried Bony: \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t do the gym\xe2\x80\x99</p>  10) Hull City\xe2\x80\x99s bewildering away form suggests they may get a result <p>The Hull Daily Mail has called for an Irish solution to Hull\xe2\x80\x99s midfield problem and demanded the introduction of David Meyler and Stephen Quinn to add much-needed steel to a midfield that was overrun at Old Trafford on Saturday when Steve Bruce\xe2\x80\x99s side make the trip to Everton. Hull\xe2\x80\x99s capitulation at Old Trafford in a match that was over as a contest by half-time was unsurprising: in 21 matches against United as a manager Bruce has failed to win a single one.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think our season is going to be defined by getting beaten at Manchester United,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruce during a brutally frank post-match interview in which he made no effort to cover up his team\xe2\x80\x99s shortcomings. He did, however, point out that they have also had to face Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle away this season, appearing to imply that the fixture list has not been all that kind.</p> <p>Strangely, what Bruce did not mention is that Hull emerged with creditable draws from those three games but lost on the road against Aston Villa and Burnley. After four consecutive defeats adding to their sole away win against QPR with victory at Everton would help ease pressure on a manager whose odds against being next for the boot are understandably only marginally longer than those against his club getting relegated.
