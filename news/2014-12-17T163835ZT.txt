b'<p>LIFE\xe2\x80\x99S A BEACH. BECAUSE IT\xe2\x80\x99S A FIVER INVOLVING BOURNEMOUTH (BRIEFLY). AND BOURNEMOUTH HAS BEACHES</p> <p>In the space of just five years, almost to the day, Brendan Rodgers has gone from being sacked by Reading to being tipped for the sack at a far more prestigious club. It has been a meteoric rise for the Northern Irishman, it being understood that meteors do not rise at all but instead fall at tremendous speed before exploding in spectacular style. And with Liverpool currently en route to Bournemouth (except for Brad Jones, who is believed to have set off early in the direction of Aberdeen), we must ask: does Milk Cup elimination at the hands of the Championship leaders count as a spectacular explosion?</p> <p>Of course, not all meteors explode. Some collide with other heavenly bodies to create a godawful mess. We\xe2\x80\x99ll leave it up to you to decide whether Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 signing of Mario Balotelli counts as one such collision. A headline that momentarily assailed the Fiver this afternoon suggests that Robbie Savage has offered an opinion on the matter, but nothing has ever been gained from listening to Robbie Savage so we won\xe2\x80\x99t be telling you what he said. You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.</p> <p>Besides, Balotelli isn\xe2\x80\x99t even available to play tonight. It will be interesting to see who Rodgers does deploy up front. Will he opt for Rickie Lambert, in whom he appears to have little confidence, or will he plump for Fabio Borini, in whom he appears to have less? Perhaps he will give Raheem Sterling another chance to improve his finishing? Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99ll unleash Martin Skrtel again? Maybe Simon Mignolet could be sent on to wreak havoc in the opposition\xe2\x80\x99s box for a change?</p> <p>Whoever Rodgers picks up front will, according to the manager, be part of a united and highly motivated unit that is absolutely not riven by dressing-room discontent, contrary to media rumblings. \xe2\x80\x9cOur dressing room is very strong,\xe2\x80\x9d boomed Rodgers as he ironed $tevie Mbe\xe2\x80\x99s tracksuit. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are very fortunate to have a captain who is a strong leader in the dressing room and that has been very important during my time here. Unrest is totally untrue. Of course we are unhappy at not winning games, these are competitive players who almost won the league last year and they won\xe2\x80\x99t be happy at losing because they are competitive people. Our spirit is very strong and once we get that break, we will show that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Paul Doyle from 7.45pm GMT for MBM coverage of Bournemouth 2-1 Liverpool in the Worthington Cup.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe hate to do this but it is our job to protect the players. Players haven\xe2\x80\x99t been paid for months and encounter serious financial problems. Clubs are on the verge of going bankrupt. On top of that, I received the shocking news that one of the clubs totally disrespects players\xe2\x80\x99 rights and even allows hooligans to threaten their players\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 FifPro suit Theo van Seggelen warns players against joining Serbian clubs. </p> FIVER LETTER <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m interested to learn that Alan Pardew predicts a bright England future for Harry Kane (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Bits and Bobs). Of the 42 players listed in the Newcastle United squad, just 10 are English and none of those have ever represented their country at full international level. Perhaps their manager would be better placed to comment on Fren \xe2\x80\xa6 oh, hang on, he bought Gabriel Obertan\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Alistair Drummond.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
