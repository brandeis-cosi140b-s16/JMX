b'John Terry: putting pressure on referee does not look good \xe2\x80\xa6 but PSG started it'


b'<p>John Terry has admitted Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to surround referees \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not look good at all\xe2\x80\x9d but he and his team-mates will continue to support each other in that way if they feel opponents, such as Paris Saint-Germain, are attempting to exert their own influence on the officials.</p> <p>Nine of the London club\xe2\x80\x99s outfield players had crowded around the Dutch referee, Bjorn Kuipers, following Zlatan Ibrahimovic\xe2\x80\x99s challenge on Oscar just after the half-hour mark in the second leg of the teams\xe2\x80\x99 Champions League knockout tie on Wednesday with the Brazilian prone on the turf. That reaction was branded \xe2\x80\x9cdisgraceful\xe2\x80\x9d at the time by the former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher in his capacity as a pundit for Sky.</p> <p>Ibrahimovic suggested the Chelsea players had reacted \xe2\x80\x9clike babies\xe2\x80\x9d yet Terry argued that PSG, who prevailed on away goals after extra time despite having their Sweden forward dismissed for that tackle, had been just as guilty of seeking to influence the officials. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce they\xe2\x80\x99re charging the ref, the only thing we can do is respond,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Chelsea captain.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t, as a group of players, let them surround the ref, trying to get our players booked.</p>  <p> Related: PSG\xe2\x80\x99s Zlatan Ibrahimovic: Chelsea behaved \xe2\x80\x98like babies\xe2\x80\x99 over red card </p>   <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFor me, if I have to run 20, 30 yards, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look great, but when you\xe2\x80\x99re standing back and seeing five or six of their players surrounding the ref \xe2\x80\xa6 for me, I think I support my team-mates. And once I go, four or five go with me. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look good at all, but that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the game. We\xe2\x80\x99ll match it if people want to mix it, that\xe2\x80\x99s part of our game as well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Carragher had been scathing in his criticism, claiming the gamesmanship in evidence at Stamford Bridge \xe2\x80\x93 PSG engaged in their own, with David Luiz booked for suggesting he had been head-butted by Diego Costa when contact seemed minimal \xe2\x80\x93 was indicative of a Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho side. \xe2\x80\x9cThe reaction from the Chelsea players is disgraceful,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt comes from Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s teams: it\xe2\x80\x99s not a one-off. I always think with Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s teams that they will always be respected but never loved because of situations like this. They take winning to a level that no other team or manager does. Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s words have worked.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>His fellow Sky pundit Graeme Souness added: \xe2\x80\x9cThat is not the British way of doing things. Someone brushes you, you want to go down and get them in trouble? Thank goodness the PSG team stood up to that. They are a proper team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>When those words were put to Terry, his response was blunt. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom them? Yeah. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get involved in a row but, as a group, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult. It\xe2\x80\x99s there and you have to stick up for your team-mates. Every other side is as bad as each other. It\xe2\x80\x99s part of the game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Elimination meant Chelsea were denied a seventh quarter-final appearance in nine years, but the team still top the Premier League by five points and boast a game in hand over second-placed Manchester City. They host Southampton on Sunday. Mourinho addressed his squad at Cobham on Thursday afternoon having analysed their shortcomings against PSG, and both manager and captain are expecting a rapid response.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe have to pick ourselves up and go again,\xe2\x80\x9d added Terry. \xe2\x80\x9cNow it\xe2\x80\x99s all about the Premier League. We\xe2\x80\x99ve won the Capital One Cup. That\xe2\x80\x99s in the pocket. The Premier League is all we have got to go for now, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a massive one for us.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to respond to the PSG game in the right way and regroup. We\xe2\x80\x99re even hungrier now. The manager said then if we can win the Capital One Cup and the Premier League, it will have been a very successful year. It\xe2\x80\x99s in our hands and we have to respond. As a group of players, there\xe2\x80\x99s enough experience in the squad to rally round and get everyone going again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>           Chelsea could not handle PSG pressure, says Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho '
