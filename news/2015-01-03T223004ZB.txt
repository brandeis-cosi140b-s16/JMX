b'Brendan Rodgers: Liverpool must replace Steven Gerrard with star talent'


b'<p>Brendan Rodgers has warned Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s owners that money will have to be spent on established internationals if the club is to keep progressing following Steven Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s departure \xe2\x80\x93 and has denied forcing his captain out of the club.</p> <p>Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s decision to move to the United States at the end of the season for what he called \xe2\x80\x9can incredible opportunity to try something different\xe2\x80\x9d will deprive Liverpool of its traditional home-grown core, with Jamie Carragher having retired in 2013. With the loss of Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez last summer, it means the first team is short on top-level experience too. Rodgers prides himself on promoting young talent but accepts that it is unrealistic to compete with top clubs solely by producing players from within.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe model at this football club is clear, we want to take young players and develop them into world-class ones, but that can be a long and a difficult process,\xe2\x80\x9d the Liverpool manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe owners know that, and they also know that not every player can be a developer if you are going to keep progressing. A large part of our squad will always be young players, but if you want to take those steps forward at times you have to look to bring in some ready-made players.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Carragher has criticised his old club for not doing enough to keep hold of Gerrard, perhaps by offering him a coaching position, but Rodgers denied that was ever a possibility. Using the word \xe2\x80\x9cturmoil\xe2\x80\x9d to describe his captain\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind over the past few weeks, Rodgers rejected claims that Gerrard was pushed out of the club against his wishes.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had plenty of conversations with Steven this season and he\xe2\x80\x99s never told me he felt unhappy,\xe2\x80\x9d Rodgers said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe wanted to keep him at the club, he\xe2\x80\x99s been a brilliant captain for me and we offered him a deal, but he wanted the chance to experience something different. Our communication is very open so I was aware what he was thinking and I also knew the turmoil he was in because of his unique situation. You see other players stay at one club all their careers but not too many who support Liverpool and still live where they come from, virtually five minutes round the corner.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Gerrard admitted that his \xe2\x80\x9cemotional, raw\xe2\x80\x9d decision had largely been prompted by the realisation that he would no longer be an automatic starter. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was more than one moment that made me come to this decision, but I think the key conversation or moment was with the manager when he sat me down not so long ago and said it was time to manage my games for me and for the team,\xe2\x80\x9d Gerrard told the club\xe2\x80\x99s website.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m bright enough to realise it is the right thing for everyone, but when you\xe2\x80\x99ve been a starter and a mainstay in the team for such a long time, it was a very difficult conversation to have. I accept it and I\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to give everything I\xe2\x80\x99ve got, whether I\xe2\x80\x99m starting, coming off the bench or whatever, but that was the key conversation.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI had an idea it was going to come at some time \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m a human, not a robot. I\xe2\x80\x99m not 24. I wish I was 24, I wish I\xe2\x80\x99d met Brendan when I was 24 because I\xe2\x80\x99d be sitting here talking about a lot of titles that we\xe2\x80\x99d won together. The reality is, Brendan came into this club when I was 32 years of age and it\xe2\x80\x99s a shame that relationship didn\xe2\x80\x99t start 10 years ago.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI had an idea the conversation was going to come at some time, but it was still a painful one to have.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Gerrard said the chance to start a new life in America was \xe2\x80\x9ca great opportunity for my family and myself\xe2\x80\x9d, but said no deal with an MLS club was in place. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not over the line with any team just yet. I\xe2\x80\x99m close and as soon as I know, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make the announcement, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do the bits and bobs that I need to do.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Rodgers said he felt Gerrard was right to stay focused on extending his playing career overseas, and explained why there was no offer of an Anfield coaching position. \xe2\x80\x9cThat did not form part of our conversations because he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got his badges yet and Steven isn\xe2\x80\x99t the type who would go into coaching blind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the moment he still wants to play, and coaching and management is not something you can just click your fingers and walk into. It takes two or three years to get your eye in, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pressure situation if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been accustomed to it, and it is not something that always comes naturally or instantly.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cA footballer like Steven has only known the elite level for well over a decade. If you become a coach or a manager you are working with a different type of player, not everyone can reach the elite level and you need to make an adjustment. I am sure Steven would put in the hard work and commitment should he ever make that decision, because that\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of guy he is, but it is not something that ought to be rushed into.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHis focus is very much on the present, he believes he can play on beyond this season, and there will be plenty of years ahead of him to go into coaching. Time will tell but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any reason why he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t become a top manager.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s decision means his career, not just his Liverpool years, will come to an end without a league champions medal in England, though Rodgers was quick to pay tribute to his role in taking the club so agonisingly close last season.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone references the slip in the Chelsea game but you play 38 games to win the league and we came up just short over the season,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSteven captained the team on an incredible run last year and a big part of our title challenge was down to him. His performances were monumental for us in the second part of last season, the key goals, the calmness, the composure.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe gave us the opportunity to come so close to winning the league. He has been an iconic figure at this club and always will be. Over time there will be an opportunity for him to come back here for sure. If I were still Liverpool manager I would welcome him back.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Gerrard said his short-term goal was now to win a domestic cup trophy before his Anfield career comes to an end. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve still got a chance of finishing in the top four and that\xe2\x80\x99s the most important thing for the club, for obvious reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut from a selfish point of view, it\xe2\x80\x99s always a trophy and it\xe2\x80\x99s always medals, for me.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what people remember and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the club is all about. It\xe2\x80\x99s about success and history. The day you make your debut for this club, the pressure and the responsibility is on your shoulders to keep delivering trophies to add to that wonderful history. I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived with that for so long and I\xe2\x80\x99ll live with it for another six months.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m really proud of what I\xe2\x80\x99ve done here and hopefully I can write a few more chapters with the team from now to the end. But the last game and the last couple of training sessions are going to be torture, because it\xe2\x80\x99s so tough to say goodbye. Hopefully it\xe2\x80\x99s more of a \xe2\x80\x98see you soon\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
