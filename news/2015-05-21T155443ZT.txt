b'SCRAPING THE BARREL <p>My wife complained that her feet hurt. I said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got your shoes on the wrong feet.\xe2\x80\x9d She said: \xe2\x80\x9cBut these are the only feet I\xe2\x80\x99ve got.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>When Mr Roy announced his latest England squad this afternoon and included not just QPR hotshot Charlie Austin, whose presence had been widely predicted, but Leicester, um, lukewarmshot Jamie Vardy as well, Tommy Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s old joke sprang to mind. With Harry Kane, Saido Berahino and Danny Ings off with the Under-21s and Wayne Rooney already in the senior set-up, the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s top-scorers chart didn\xe2\x80\x99t offer much assistance for the owl-faced tactician. It may very well have sounded like he\xe2\x80\x99d made a terrible mistake, but these are the only strikers he\xe2\x80\x99s got*.</p> <p>Not only did the Turkish-hatted entertainer come up with a vaguely pertinent joke for the occasion, even his name was relevant, given that coopers are employed making barrels \xe2\x80\x93 the very same staved wooden container whose metaphorical bottom Hodgson was frantically scraping.</p> <p>Less than four years ago Vardy, then 24, abandoned Halifax in favour of Fleetwood Town because \xe2\x80\x9cthey are a team on the up with ambitions of the Football League and I want to be part of that\xe2\x80\x9d. He swiftly signed an improved three-year deal there because \xe2\x80\x9cI can be a League One player at Fleetwood\xe2\x80\x9d. His old Halifax manager recently claimed \xe2\x80\x9cI always thought he was good enough to play in the Championship\xe2\x80\x9d. Now he\xe2\x80\x99s in the England team, having completed the most unlikely ascent since Dumbo first looked to the heavens and flapped his ears.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI watched him when he was still at Fleetwood and players who have that pace and desire to run in behind defenders are always interesting for coaches,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Roy as he announced his squad. \xe2\x80\x9cHis latter part of the season has been really excellent.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s referring there to the three goals in five games that Vardy scored during March and April, a considerable improvement on the one in 28 that the remainder of Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s league campaign brought him.</p> <p>But news that Vardy first blipped on Mr Roy\xe2\x80\x99s radar back in his Fleetwood days was telling indeed. Mr Roy was appointed England manager on 1 May 2012, 17 days before Vardy finally left non-league football to join Leicester. Though it\xe2\x80\x99s true that he may have scouted the forward on behalf of his previous employers, West Brom, the admission suggested that one of his first acts as boss of the national team had been to hotfoot it to Lancashire in order to check out a player toiling in the fifth tier of English football. And if so he truly is a visionary, a man with a rare grasp of the realities afflicting English football, as well as one with a near-unbeatable method for encouraging lower-league strikers. </p> <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s not like 28-year-old Vardy can even be considered one for the future. The only way this player\xe2\x80\x99s going to qualify for the Under-21s any time soon is if the criteria is expanded to include not only age but the last couple of seasons\xe2\x80\x99 combined tally of league goals \xe2\x80\x93 in which case his new international team-mate Danny Welbeck can also expect a call-up. Such is the state we\xe2\x80\x99re in. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope Mr Roy\xe2\x80\x99s still keeping a beady one on those non-league scoring charts.</p> <p>* Except for Peter Crouch and Glenn Murray, who both have seven top-flight goals this season, Gabriel Agbonlahor with six and Dwight Gayle, Ashley Barnes, Connor Wickham, Andy Carroll and David Nugent with five, all of their tallies greater than Vardy\xe2\x80\x99s four (though he\xe2\x80\x99s level with Welbeck).</p> <p>Full England squad: Rob Green (QPR), Joe Hart (Manchester City), Tom Heaton (Burnley), Ryan Bertrand (Southampton), Gary Cahill (Chelsea), Nathaniel Clyne (Southampton), Kieran Gibbs (Arsenal), Phil Jagielka (Everton), Phil Jones (Manchester United), Chris Smalling (Manchester United), Ross Barkley (Everton), Fabian Delph (Aston Villa), Jordan Henderson (Liverpool), Adam Lallana (Liverpool), Ryan Mason (Tottenham), James Milner (Manchester City), Raheem Sterling (Liverpool), Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver (Fiver Towers), Andros Townsend (Tottenham), Theo Walcott (Arsenal), Jack Wilshere (Arsenal), Charlie Austin (QPR), Wayne Rooney (Manchester United), Jamie Vardy (Leicester), Danny Welbeck (Arsenal). </p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cCarragher is a kn@b. Everybody knows it. Any of the criticism from current pundits or ex-Liverpool players \xe2\x80\x93 none of them things matter to me. It is not relevant\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Aidy Ward, the agent of Raheem Sterling, rejects the views of TV\xe2\x80\x99s Jamie Carragher. Ward reportedly claims the quotes were taken out of context and given off the record. So not so much a denial, more that he thought nobody would find out about them.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf Calvin Jones\xe2\x80\x99 suggestion for insignia above the badge were to be implemented (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver Letters), would Southend be permitted to include two crashed vans (2004 and 2005) covered in paint (2013) to reflect our array of glorious 2-0 defeats in national finals?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Phil Jones.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about jazz, but I shall guess the identity of the marvellous lady saxophone player at the Manchester United dinner (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver). My first hunch was the precocious American Lisa Simpson, but I\xe2\x80\x99d have to go with the Dutch smooth jazz artist Candy Dulfer. She shares with Louis Van Gaal not only the same nationality but also the ability to blow hot air and make it sound like sweet music to their fans, who give big applause\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Peter Oh.</p> <p> \xe2\x80\x9cIf Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s performance at his club end-of-season beano can be seen as a sax solo, surely it was less Baker Street and more Hot and Heavy\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Tom Goodfellow.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWith regards to yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver tome, Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s Sax Appeal, I thought it was just another typically incoherent soliloquy that had reached my inbox at lunch time (here in the States), per usual, from you boys in Guardian Towers. That Queen\xe2\x80\x99s English does leave me befuddled at times. Then I realized you were actually quoting Louis van Gaal directly, and all credit I had given to The Fiver evaporated. With such a gift for for the spoken word that shines so brilliantly as written prose, perhaps LVG should become the regular writer for The Fiver. Clearly, it would not be much of a drop-off from The Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s recent form\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Steven Mintz.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

The defender has said \xe2\x80\x9cnein\xe2\x80\x9d to the idea of joining United, preferring to stay with Borussia Dortmund instead.</p> <p>Xavi has kicked sand in the face of his legacy and tied the shoelaces of his reputation together by expressing his \xe2\x80\x9cexcitement\xe2\x80\x9d at leaving Barcelona for the \xe2\x80\x9cthrilling\xe2\x80\x9d project of Al-Sadd in Qatar. </p> <p>The chairman of the Polish Football Association has asked for the 2018 World Cup to be confiscated from Russia. \xe2\x80\x9cHosting the World Cup in Russia is a disastrous mistake, it\xe2\x80\x99s a country engaged in war, who invaded another country,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zbigniew Boniek.</p> <p>And the former West Ham defender Slaven Bilic has set managerial two-plus-two merchants in east London a quiver by announcing he will leave Besiktas at the end of the season.</p> STILL WANT MORE? <p>Sunderland remain alive! Dick Advocaat was so happy at their survival he cried salt tears of joy, and Amy Lawrence was there to write about it.</p> <p>Sunderland remain alive! Louise Taylor was so happy at their survival she found five reasons for it and wrote them down.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe lost a kit man and he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t replaced. There were issues with player registrations, travel, accommodation. It is just about getting things done in a proper manner. There always seemed to be something happening that could be prevented, something that would create a negative. As a football manager, they were things I didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect to have to deal with.\xe2\x80\x9d Lee Clark tells Ewan Murray of the shambles at Blackpool.</p> <p>Leeds are another club about whom you could say \xe2\x80\x9ccrikey, what a mess\xe2\x80\x9d.
