b'FA Cup fifth round: what to look out for in this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s matches'


b'1) Will Arsenal cope with the workload? <p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger admitted his side were \xe2\x80\x9cnot the sharpest\xe2\x80\x9d in beating Leicester during the week, with a hangover from the defeat in the north London derby to blame. However, Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s side had better get used to the workload \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0Arsenal are the only team still in the FA Cup and Champions League. Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez, Jack Wilshere and Gabriel Paulista could all face Middlesbrough on Sunday but it will be interesting to see what sort of side Wenger selects for a competition that is very much third priority for the club.</p> <p>Anything other than a full-strength, fully-motivated Arsenal could struggle. Boro, boasting the best defence in the Championship by quite a margin, have won five on the bounce in the league and have lost only once since mid-October. Also, the trip to the Emirates will not be intimidating: Boro were drawn away from home in rounds three and four, winning both 2-0, first, to no one\xe2\x80\x99s great surprise against Barnsley, then stunningly against Manchester City. Boro hope and expect to be rubbing shoulders with Premier League sides from August. This is another good test \xe2\x80\x93 and it\xe2\x80\x99s also a test of the strength and depth of Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s squad.

It was perhaps with this in mind that Randy Lerner finally lost patience with Paul Lambert, bundling him out of the exit door in an attempt to prevent otherwise loyal supporters from sitting out this uninspiring fifth-round tie in favour of a trip to the local World of Cine to witness a sadistic spanking of a different kind.</p> <p>As Sunday lunchtime treats go, a week ago this FA Cup encounter between two of the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s bottom three sides had all the allure of a desiccated vegan nut roast but recent events have made it significantly meatier and more appetising. The dismissal of Lambert as Villa manager will have buoyed flagging spirits in the stands at Villa Park, where occupants will be interested to see what, if any, improvement their moribund team can muster under the temporary stewardship of the first-team coach, Scott Marshall, and his namesake, the goalkeeping coach, Andy.</p> <p>Following his well-documented travails of recent days, including yet another valiant Premier League defeat, Nigel Pearson will be anxious to hoist two metaphorical fingers in the direction of the \xe2\x80\x9cfountains of knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d on Match of the Day held responsible by him for making a bigger deal than was necessary out of his touchline antics at the King Power Stadium last weekend.</p> <p>A contest one cannot help but feel both sides would previously have been reasonably content to lose has been given something resembling a frisson. Who will dominate? Who will submit? And perhaps more pertinently, can we look forward to some touchline restraint?

Both teams are capable of good football and this might well be a classic but it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to know who beyond supporters of the teams involved will be looking out for West Brom versus West Ham at lunchtime on Saturday.</p> <p>Both the BBC and BT Sport been roundly panned for their choice of live broadcasts in this year\xe2\x80\x99s competition, at times unfairly as there\xe2\x80\x99s a certain amount of educated guesswork involved. However, with the national broadcaster having had first pick of this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s eight ties and taken Preston versus Manchester United, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to imagine the logic behind their rival\xe2\x80\x99s decision to plump for a match of little interest to neutrals, when one featuring the League One side Bradford City, undisputed heroes of the last round entertaining Premier League opposition on a dreadful pitch ripe for an upset, has been completely overlooked. For all the misty-eyed guff they peddle about the magic of the FA Cup, those broadcasting it seem content to let general public interest in the grand old competition disappear. BG</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 West Brom end Birmingham Cup dream   \xe2\x80\xa2 West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup blushes spared by Diafra Sakho winner at Bristol City  4) Stoke can inject some spice into their season <p>Stoke are the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s undisputed kings of mid-table. In the past three years, after the sixth match of a season \xe2\x80\x93 once the peaks and troughs in the embryonic table have settled down \xe2\x80\x93 they\xe2\x80\x99ve never been higher than eighth, they\xe2\x80\x99ve never been lower than 17th, and even that was for two brief weeks in 2013-14. And that zen-like state of uneventfulness extends to the cup competitions \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0since reaching the FA Cup final in 2010-11, they had one sixth-round exit and two fourth-round departures, and their record is equally unremarkable of late in the League Cup. Nothing too bad to get angry about, nothing so good that it raises much excitement.</p> <p>This, then, is a chance to get the pulses racing at the Britannia. The bookies have them as fifth favourites but they\xe2\x80\x99ve already beaten one of the sides ahead of them in the betting this season (Arsenal), given another a proper scare (Manchester United) and narrowly lost away at another (Liverpool). It\xe2\x80\x99s a tricky tie \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0Blackburn Rovers may be focused on the Championship play-off race but they\xe2\x80\x99re no strangers to the business end of the competition, having been to the last eight in 2012-13 and to the final four in 2004-05 and 2006-07, and have one of the best home records in the division \xe2\x80\x93 but hopes should be high.\xc2\xa0JA</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Stoke ease past Rochdale  \xe2\x80\xa2 Blackburn\xe2\x80\x99s Rudy Gestede punishes Swansea after Bartley\xe2\x80\x99s red card  5) If you expect a Bradford victory and they oblige, does it still count as a shock? <p>If Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s players were as adept at passing the ball as their manager is the buck, Gus Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s team would currently enjoy the luxury of being touted as genuine contenders for an FA Cup that ought to take a little less winning than usual. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t analyse about passing the ball because nobody wanted to pass the ball here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gus, going on to blame impatient home fans for pressurising his players into tearing up the repeatedly tried and increasingly untrusted Poyet blueprint that has had his ponderous side shuffling around the lower regions of the Premier League resembling extras from The Walking Dead.</p> <p>When Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s fans and players aren\xe2\x80\x99t at fault for poor results, Gus is never shy about pointing his Big Finger of Blame at referees but before Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Bradford he has been getting his excuses in early by blaming the pitch. To be fair, his concerns are not without foundation as the Valley Parade sward is widely regarded as one of the worst playing surfaces in the Football League. Such is its deplorable state that even the third-tier side\xe2\x80\x99s manager, Phil Parkinson, has publicly admonished his employers for failing to provide a hard-working groundsman he described as having been \xe2\x80\x9chung out to dry\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cthe help needed from upstairs to make it better\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>With Sunderland more used to snookering themselves on the comparatively smooth baize surfaces of various Premier League turfs, this weekend the ploughed field ought to act as Bradford\xe2\x80\x99s ally. The Bantams are no route-one cloggers, as their excellent come-from-behind win against Chelsea in the last round demonstrated, but at least their players will be accustomed to the \xe2\x80\x9cnuance\xe2\x80\x9d of a surface so churned up and devoid of bounce that one of their recent home matches against Colchester came within a hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth of being postponed.</p> <p>It is difficult to know just how seriously Poyet will take this match but defeat for whatever side he fields would not be well-received by the travelling 4,200. For all that, while a win for the League One side languishing 37 places beneath their visitors would constitute an FA Cup shock in the very technical sense, it would not come as any great surprise. BG</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Bradford\xe2\x80\x99s defeat of Chelsea: a cup giant-killing to rival the very best  \xe2\x80\xa2 Sunderland sweep through after Marcus Bettinelli own goal undoes Fulham  6) Derby have a final-day dress rehearsal <p>Derby and Reading have met twice already this season \xe2\x80\x93 once in the league and once in the Capital One Cup \xe2\x80\x93 with the Rams currently leading 5-0 on aggregate. And this is also a pre-run of Derby\xe2\x80\x99s final-day fixture, when Reading will again be the visitors to the iPro Stadium. Given the spandex-tight state of the Championship automatic promotion race it would be no surprise if that game is a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa3100m match\xe2\x80\x9d for the home club. There\xe2\x80\x99s not quite as much riding on this game but both sides will see this as an opportunity. The Rams have bigger fish to fry but they have not been beyond this stage since 1998-99, when a team featuring Igor Stimac, Paulo Wanchope and Horacio Carbonari took them to the quarter-finals. That\xe2\x80\x99s quite a wait for a club of Derby\xe2\x80\x99s size. Reading, on the other hand, aren\xe2\x80\x99t quite as far from the relegation zone as they\xe2\x80\x99d like to be but are most likely in line for a couple of pretty dull months in the league. A bit of Cup excitement would pep up the start of Steve Clarke\xe2\x80\x99s reign quite nicely.

A tactical muddle, shakier at the back than a put-up-yourself wardrobe, constantly feeling shrouded by a strange miasma of uncertainty \xe2\x80\xa6 \xc2\xa0and yet they could well end the season with a third-placed finish in the Premier League and another FA Cup win. That, given the state of the side at the end of last season, would be a triumph in anyone\xe2\x80\x99s book. Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s side didn\xe2\x80\x99t so much flirt with embarrassment against Cambridge United in the last round as buy embarrassment a drink and attempt a few dodgy chat-up lines, and Preston, who haven\xe2\x80\x99t reached the last eight since 1965-66, are more than capable of giving their neighbours another scare. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of a thankless task for United \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0anything other than a comprehensive win will be seen as another weak display \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0but their manager will be eager to see a few signs of cohesion and a little more evidence that this sometimes shambling season can end in success.

We all remember the Scouse (and Uruguayan) wailing and gnashing of teeth that greeted the final whistle of their match against Palace at the back end of last season, while the abiding memory of November\xe2\x80\x99s renewal was the sight of a forlorn and barely audible Brendan Rodgers sitting, head bowed, staring at a table-top as he struggled to make sense of it all. Again.</p> <p>On an FA Cup weekend when it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to know just how many of the 16 managers involved will be entirely enthused by the prospect of progressing to the last eight of the tournament, the motivation of Alan Pardew is unlikely to be questioned. His team are enjoying their best form of the season and look to have more than enough about them to avoid relegation from the Premier League with a minimum of fuss, which means he can focus all his attention on heaping further embarrassment on Liverpool. As somebody who has played in an FA Cup final for Palace, scoring the winning goal against them in the semi-final en route, he has previous and will leave no stone unturned in his efforts to win this game and further enhance his status, having looked a completely beaten docket at Newcastle only a few months ago.</p> <p>For Liverpool and Rodgers, a top-four finish and Champions League qualification must remain the priority but the spectre of further embarrassment in south London, not to mention Steven Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s well-documented date with birthday destiny at Wembley, will give Rodgers plenty to think about. With every Premier League fixture a Champions League qualifier in all but name from now on, does he field a full-strength side and risk losing big-name players to a treatment room already occupied by Gerrard and Lucas Leiva?</p> <p>With the Europa League, another route towards qualification for the Champions League, resuming after its winter hiatus next week, the pragmatist in Rodgers could be excused for fielding a young second-string side against Palace and hoping for the best, while keeping his gaze focused solely on the bigger picture. Whether or not his considerable ego will permit such a sensible approach in the wake of recent Selhurst Park reverses remains to be seen.
