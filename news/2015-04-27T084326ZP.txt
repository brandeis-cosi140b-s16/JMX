b'Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend\xe2\x80\x99s action | Guardian writers'


b'1) \xe2\x80\x98It was the best JT has ever played\xe2\x80\x99 <p>How can it possibly be that John Terry can play with this distinction but not even merit a place on the shortlist for the PFA Player of the Year award? But then, there are a lot of awkward questions that still surround Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s formidable captain. Watching him play with so much authority, then listening to the eulogy that came from his manager, once again the thought occurred of what a mess it is that England\xe2\x80\x99s best central defender is not involved with the national team and, at this stage, almost certainly never will be. Perhaps it is the occasional rest on international weeks that is helping Terry put in one of the outstanding seasons of his career. \xe2\x80\x9cI told John Terry in the dressing room he had [put in some] fantastic performances for me, but this was his best,\xe2\x80\x9d Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the best JT has ever played. It was absolutely amazing. He\xe2\x80\x99s had fantastic performances in the five or six years we worked together, and some of them with goals. One performance at Highbury, I think in my first season, was a fantastic performance too. But I think today everything was clean: reading the game, giving cover, leading the defensive line, making interceptions, even in the pass. The team was phenomenal, but John was one step ahead of every other player.\xe2\x80\x9d Daniel Taylor</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Daniel Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s match report: Arsenal 0-0 Chelsea\xe2\x80\xa2 Six Chelsea players named in PFA team of the year\xe2\x80\xa2 Mourinho rejects \xe2\x80\x98boring\xe2\x80\x99 criticism after Chelsea hold off Arsenal \xe2\x80\xa2 Dominic Fifield: Wenger frustrated at Chelsea resilience\xe2\x80\xa2 Arsenal 0-0 Chelsea: player ratings</p>            Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger: Chelsea will be Premier League champions \xe2\x80\x93 video    2) Are Stones and Barkley coming of age? <p>Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s complacent attitude at Goodison Park attracted fierce condemnation from Louis van Gaal but it should not detract from the disciplined defensive performance and clinical touch that brought Everton their biggest win in the fixture since 1992. Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s side were just six points above the relegation zone when they hosted Newcastle United on 15 March. They are now pursuing a top-half finish after a six-game unbeaten run that has yielded five victories. The repair to Ross Barkley\xe2\x80\x99s confidence and John Stones\xe2\x80\x99s maturity in central defence (although his distribution remains a work in progress) have been key factors, especially in the United win. \xe2\x80\x9cTo highlight just one player would be unfair,\xe2\x80\x9dsaid the Everton manager. \xe2\x80\x9cBut John deserves his moment because scoring his first goal for Everton is a memory he is going to treasure. The boys were giving him a hard time recently because he only scores in training, but his defensive display was his best since he was playing in the first team. I also thought Ross had his most complete performance for Everton.\xe2\x80\x9d Andy Hunter</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Everton 3-0 Manchester United\xe2\x80\xa2 Van Gaal slams team for complacency at Everton</p>      John Stones scored his first Everton goal in what Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez called his best defensive display in the first team. Photograph: Matthew Ashton/AMA/Corbis    3) Burnley limitations begin to drag them down  <p>No one can fault Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s heart or commitment. They run and they sweat and they graft for the cause and it is testament to Sean Dyche\xe2\x80\x99s managerial acumen that the prospect of them staying up is not completely out of the question. The truth is that few people gave them a chance at the start of the season. Yet their hopes are fading and their limitations at this level are beginning to catch up with them.</p> <p>Burnley have stopped scoring. They have three goals in their past 10 matches and that has coincided with Danny Ings\xe2\x80\x99s barren run. Ings has not scored since his header flew past David de Gea in the 3-1 defeat at Manchester United nine games ago. Burnley felt that they were the better side in their 1-0 defeat against Leicester City on Saturday. Yet they struggled to create chances in open play \xe2\x80\x93 Ings had one sight of goal and was denied by a smart stop by Kasper Schmeichel \xe2\x80\x93 and Matt Taylor wasted their best opportunity, smacking his penalty against the post when the game was goalless.</p> <p>Ultimately Leicester contained Burnley, who badly missed the suspended Ashley Barnes and the injured Sam Vokes. The absence of that pair meant that Ings was partnered up front by Lukas Jutkiewicz, who has not scored this season. When Jutkiewicz was substituted, his replacement was Marvin Sordell. His record in the league this season is two starts, 11 substitute appearances and no goals. Jacob Steinberg</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Interview: Nigel Pearson \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t like all I am\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Burnley 0-1 Leicester</p>  4) Pardew has no time for Hull\xe2\x80\x99s tactics <p>Alan Pardew had issues with Mark Clattenburg, the referee, after his Crystal Palace team\xe2\x80\x99s 2-0 home defeat by Hull City on Saturday. However, unlike some other managers we could name, he was not planning an immediate call to Mike Riley, the head of the Professional Game Match Official Ltd to express outrage over the officials\xe2\x80\x99 failure to spot a handling offence in the buildup to Hull City\xe2\x80\x99s opening goal or Clattenburg\xe2\x80\x99s decision to disallow an equaliser by Yaya Sanogo. Instead he called for independent timekeepers after what he perceived as blatant time-wasting by Hull.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI hope Mark sits down at some point and looks at that second half and times the substitutions coming off the pitch, times how long one free-kick took, when they made eight different decisions how to take it,\xe2\x80\x9d Pardew said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got no problem with that, but give us the time [back], and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. I think there is a case, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s been talked about before, for timekeeping to come away from the referee. Someone gives us the time so we know exactly what it is, and if it\xe2\x80\x99s 12 minutes, 13 minutes, that\xe2\x80\x99s what it is, we play it.\xe2\x80\x9d Nick Szczepanik</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Crystal Palace 0-2 Hull City\xe2\x80\xa2 Bruce: I\xe2\x80\x99d lose cash if Hull went down but failure would cost me</p>            Hull City players to have wages slashed by half if club is relegated    5) Has time finally caught up with Lampard? <p>Considering all the trouble Manchester City went to in their determination to keep Frank Lampard for the second half of the season, and the damage it caused to the reputation of their sister club New York City FC, it is worth asking the question if it was really worth it. The veteran has begun City\xe2\x80\x99s last two games, but before then he had only started once in three months and some of his late cameos, particularly in the Camp Nou and at Old Trafford, appeared thank you gestures by Manuel Pellegrini, granting him a valedictory appearance on the biggest of stages, and his last two appearances have suggested Lampard has lost the sharpness which enabled him to play at such a high level for so long. Perhaps it is a result of rare inactivity for a footballer who is accustomed to clocking up the miles in the midfield; perhaps, like his adversary, counterpart and friend Steven Gerrard, time has finally caught up with a 36-year-old veteran of more than 1,000 games. Either way, as Aston Villa dominated in midfield with Jack Grealish, who is young enough to be Lampard\xe2\x80\x99s son, Pellegrini replaced the veteran with James Milner, looking to shore up his side with a player with more running power. It seemed sadly telling. Richard Jolly</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report Manchester City 3-2 Aston Villa\xe2\x80\xa2 They think it\xe2\x80\x99s all over: ex-footballers on life after the final whistle</p>            Brain fade: \xe2\x80\x98Aston Villa fan\xe2\x80\x99 David Cameron confuses his team for West Ham    6) Eriksen makes the right point about Kane <p>How heartening was Christian Eriksen\xe2\x80\x99s reply when asked after Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s match at Southampton whether he thought Harry Kane should go to the Under-21 European Championship with England this summer? The Middelfarter, if that is what folks from his home town are known as, has played in the tournament for Denmark and his response to the question about Kane seemed in tune with the vibe that Kane himself has given off: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s up to him. It is a good tournament to play \xe2\x80\xa6 I think it is always fun to do. I think it is a place where you can show off.\xe2\x80\x9d Hear that? Nothing about workloads or money or whether it would be a shrewd career move: Kane should play Because It\xe2\x80\x99ll Be Fun and He\xe2\x80\x99ll Enjoy Expressing Himself. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it lovely to get the occasional break from the seriousness of football? Paul Doyle</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Southampton 2-2 Tottenham Hotspur\xe2\x80\xa2 Paul Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League team of the season \xe2\x80\x93 in pictures</p>  7) Adam beginning to prove his worth at Stoke <p>It might not have been quite another goal of the season contender like his wondrous one from his own half against Chelsea recently, yet Charlie Adam still added another stellar strike to his ever-increasing showreel with Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s equaliser against Sunderland. Few players in the Premier League strike the ball better than the Scotland international and this top-corner piledriver made it three goals in his last four outings. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just Adam\xe2\x80\x99s goal which stood out, however. At his best, he is a rare commodity as comfortable snapping at heels as he is capable of stunning strikes. Not so long ago Adam was fighting for a place on the Stoke bench never mind their starting XI \xe2\x80\x93 this was only his 11th league start of the campaign, making his return of five goals particularly impressive \xe2\x80\x93 so it is a testament to his determination that he has forced his way back into Hughes\xe2\x80\x99s plans. Now he looks like the player who shone week after week for Blackpool in 2010-11 \xe2\x80\x93 when he scored 12 goals in a relegated team \xe2\x80\x93 and persuaded Liverpool to part with \xc2\xa39m for his services. With 12 months remaining on his contract the 29-year-old has signalled his intent to commit his remaining best years to Stoke and surely it is an opportunity manager Mark Hughes will not pass up. Brendan McLoughlin</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Stoke 1-1 Sunderland</p>  8) Whether WBA is sold or not, Pulis has the nous to give them stability <p>Jeremy Peace is \xe2\x80\x9ca very astute man\xe2\x80\x9d, Tony Pulis confirmed on Saturday evening, and if the West Bromwich Albion chairman has not found a buyer for the club by the end of next month, his new head coach can expect to open the transfer window with a pledge to get the club back on the track where Dan Ashworth and Roy Hodgson had led them three years ago. Pulis says he has not been told the cut-off date by which Peace will no longer listen to offers to sell up for up to \xc2\xa3200m but that \xe2\x80\x9che understands the situation\xe2\x80\x9d.</p>     Tony Pulis, right, and Brendan Rodgers will already be thinking about signings which will stengthen their sides for next season. Photograph: BPI/REX Shutterstock    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s not sold by a certain time, that\xe2\x80\x99ll be it, he\xe2\x80\x99ll keep it and move forward,\xe2\x80\x9d Pulis added. The former Stoke and Crystal Palace manager is a past master in acquiring the players to help develop medium-sized clubs such as West Brom but as much as this, Peace\xe2\x80\x99s declaration that he will sell \xe2\x80\x93 businessmen from America and the Far East have been shown round the club \xe2\x80\x93 will buy him patience from any fans who would denigrate the achievement of establishing West Brom in the Premier League for, barring a surprising turn of events, a fifth successive season.</p> <p>If any supporters moan as Peace sanctions bids for, say, Peter Crouch, Bakary Sako, Matt Jarvis or Aaron Lennon for West Brom to grind their way into mid-table, the chairman can turn round and say: what is the alternative? Who else wants to run your club? It\xe2\x80\x99s a savvy move. West Brom fans should be grateful. Peter Lansley</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: West Brom 0-0 Liverpool\xe2\x80\xa2 Rodgers casts doubt on Daniel Sturridge\xe2\x80\x99s future at Liverpool</p>  9) John Carver should not be judged too harshly <p>It is easy to blame Newcastle United\xe2\x80\x99s coach for the seven straight defeats which have sucked the team to the fringe of a relegation skirmish but even Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho might have struggled to cope with the injuries and suspensions which have so ravaged an already overly slender squad. For example here is the team Carver would probably pick were every player in his squad available:</p> <p>(4-3-1-2) Krul (currently playing); Janmaat (currently playing), S Taylor (out for the season with a ruptured achilles), Coloccini (currently playing but only recently back from a damaging four-game suspension), Dummett (out with a knee injury); Sissoko (suspended at the moment), Tiot\xc3\xa9 (out for the season with a knee injury), Colback (currently playing); De Jong (returned as a late substitute against Swansea and volleyed a classy goal after spending the season sidelined); Ciss\xc3\xa9 (suspended at the moment); P\xc3\xa9rez (currently playing).</p> <p>So to summarise of Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s strongest potential team, five players: Steven Taylor, Paul Dummett, Moussa Sissoko, Cheik Tiot\xc3\xa9 and Papiss Ciss\xc3\xa9 were missing against Swansea, with a sixth, Siem de Jong, only fit enough to make a late cameo appearance from the bench. This, though, was the palpably weaker side which started against the 3-2 home defeat to Garry Monk\xe2\x80\x99s side:</p> <p>(4-3-3) Krul; Janmaat (and Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s player of the season was forced off with sickness in the second half), Williamson, Coloccini, Anita; R Taylor, Colback, Guti\xc3\xa9rrez; Cabella, Rivi\xc3\xa8re, P\xc3\xa9rez</p> <p>I wonder how many current Premier League managers would back themselves to beat a very decent Swansea side with that lot on their teamsheet? Yes, motivation is one part of Carver\xe2\x80\x99s problem with certain individuals letting him down but it\xe2\x80\x99s far from the whole story. Louise Taylor</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Newcastle 2-3 Swansea</p>  10) West Ham heading for Europe \xe2\x80\xa6 via the back door <p>There was a moment midway through the second half at Loftus Road on Saturday when, as with each passing minute it became more obvious that the game was heading for a scoreless draw, the West Ham fans burst into song. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re on top of the league,\xe2\x80\x9d they chanted, tongues firmly placed in cheeks. That league is the fair play league. Each year, Uefa gives an additional Europa League place to the top three ranked member associations. England are in third and West Ham lead the Premier League table.</p> <p>It may not be the desired route, especially considering they looked well placed before Christmas to push for a top-six finish, but should it be sneered at? The majority will look at it negatively but the club have not been in Europe since 2006-07, when they were hammered at the first hurdle by Palermo. That is a long wait and if the gap between mid-table and the top six continues to expand, then the only avenues in are a cup win or a good disciplinary record.
