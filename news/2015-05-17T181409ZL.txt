b'<p>The jury remains out on whether Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s Manchester United are the real deal or imposters. The verdict will not be known until next season, when a judgment can be made on whether the manager has solved the conundrum of how for most of this campaign United have been a middling side who have failed to convince yet have finished up in the top four.</p> <p>Given the games won that may well have been lost last year under David Moyes and a month-long burst of brilliance when United changed into a menacing proposition, the story of Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s first United campaign could be \xe2\x80\x9cour inconsistency is final\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>As Arsenal arrived for United\xe2\x80\x99s penultimate match the Dutchman continued to search for the week-in, week-out displays of metronomic excellence that were Sir Alex Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s calling card during his gilded tenure.</p> <p>For a four-week, four-match period that ran from the 3-0 hiding of Tottenham Hotspur in March to the equally emphatic 4-2 win over Manchester City a month later, Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s United became a fast and hungry shredding machine that also tore up Liverpool, 2-1 at Anfield, and Aston Villa, 3-1 here.</p> <p>On a day when Chris Smalling led the side in Wayne Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s absence and Radamel Falcao was preferred ahead of Robin van Persie, the question was: which United would turn up? The one-paced side witnessed for most of the season or the one who for that month appeared to herald a brave new Van Gaal dawn?</p> <p>The answer was the former. While United were marginally the better team, the fare offered up continued in the vein of the three consecutive losses and last week\xe2\x80\x99s scrambled victory at Crystal Palace that followed the four wins.</p> <p>As Van Gaal has noted when bemoaning United\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League form on the road, there is a need to fix how they perform outside of Old Trafford. Three of those four matches claimed in scintillating fashion were played at their stadium. Away from home they have managed only six league victories, having drawn seven and lost five. Conversely, before this match, there had been 14 wins, two draws and only three defeats in front of the United fans.</p>           Louis van Gaal: Arsenal cannot \xe2\x80\x98finish the game\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 video    <p>Yet despite home advantage United were again hampered by their main affliction: a kind of sideways-itis that causes a lack of pace in thought, pass and movement. Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s squad also lack players who possess raw speed and it was instructive that United\xe2\x80\x99s opener derived from the only man to possess some, Ashley Young.</p> <p>The winger\xe2\x80\x99s quick step bought him a crucial moment to cross to Ander Herrera whose volley beyond David Ospina was decisive and an eighth goal of what is ending as an impressive debut season.</p> <p>Memphis Depay\xe2\x80\x99s arrival in the close season will help solve the lack of pace at the club as the 21-year-old Dutchman is seriously fast. Depay also carries a goal threat \xe2\x80\x93 he was PSV Eindhoven\xe2\x80\x99s top scorer in the club\xe2\x80\x99s title-winning season.</p> <p>As Rooney boasts the club\xe2\x80\x99s best return with only 12 goals this is a further boon from the Dutchman\xe2\x80\x99s addition.</p> <p>Yet the manager admits he is signing only potential, saying of Depay: \xe2\x80\x9cThe plan is to help him develop as a player but we must all be patient. The Premier League is very different from any other league and it will take time for him to fully adapt to the pace and unforgiving nature of football in this country.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>What also promises to be unforgiving is the scrutiny Van Gaal will draw if he ends the summer having spent the \xc2\xa3150m available to him \xe2\x80\x93 to make it a \xc2\xa3300m splurge in 12 months \xe2\x80\x93 and come the close of September United remain a ponderous unit who are still not contenders.</p> <p>That victory over Liverpool should offer most heart to Van Gaal and his players as it came away from home. On that day Juan Mata registered two fine goals as the oft-referred-to Van Gaal philosophy clicked. The 63-year-old had spoken consistently of the need for time for his methods to bed in.</p> <p>When Tottenham were given their schooling at Old Trafford it seemed this had finally happened in what was league outing No29.</p> <p>But by No33, and the 1-0 defeat at Chelsea, United were back in the old routine of enjoying possession but being unable to kill off the opposition. Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side defeated them through a breakaway, first-half Eden Hazard goal.</p> <p>In one sense this match with Arsenal was an irrelevance, a once-titanic clash reduced to the footballing equivalent of two bald men arguing over a comb as each club had already secured Champions League football.</p> <p>But, for Van Gaal, it was a further indication that his work this close season is all about ensuring the side hit the ground running on 8 August when the new league season starts and continue sprinting on just about each and every match-day.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI know for a club of this stature that finishing fourth in the Premier League is not something to celebrate but I hope you will agree it is a step in the right direction to getting this club back to competing at the highest level, both domestically and in European competition,\xe2\x80\x9d Van Gaal said.</p> <p>To achieve this goal, the manager has until next autumn to prove who the true United are.</p>'
