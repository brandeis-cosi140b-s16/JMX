b'Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend'


b'1) No thrilla for Villa <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re working on something new and the lads seem to enjoy it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Paul Lambert after introducing a short-passing build-from-the-back approach in early December. Whether the players are still enjoying it is unclear (though Lambert insists that they are), but fans of entertainment certainly aren\xe2\x80\x99t. Villa are by some distance the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s lowest scorers. In the 20 league games they\xe2\x80\x99ve played this season, they have failed to score 11 times. And they\xe2\x80\x99ve scored just once in their last five Premier League fixtures. And the long-suffering Villa fans could be forgiven for casting covetous glances at this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s opponents Leicester City. While Villa are unable to fork out the \xc2\xa32.5m asked by Manchester City for Scott Sinclair the Foxes have broken their club transfer record for the second time in little over six months \xe2\x80\x93 the \xc2\xa39.7m spent on Andrej Kramaric eclipsing the \xc2\xa38m purchase of Leonardo Ulloa in the summer. Good job then that Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s team have a defensive record better than seven of the 11 teams above them in the table. And, stats fans, only one team \xe2\x80\x93 QPR \xe2\x80\x93 have conceded more goals than Leicester this season. It\xe2\x80\x99s the entirely resistible force meeting the very much moveable object. So: a third Villa 0-0 on the bounce?

Photograph: Ben Queenborough/BPI/REX    2) Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s post-Bony world <p>Wilfried Bony started on the bench against Queens Park Rangers on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day but he highlighted his importance to Swansea City with the pirouette and stabbed shot from the edge of the area, all in one breathtaking movement, that rescued a point for Garry Monk\xe2\x80\x99s side. Yet that was Bony\xe2\x80\x99s last act in a Swansea shirt. He is closing in on a \xc2\xa330m move to Manchester City, having scored most goals in the Premier League in 2014, and Swansea are bound to miss him. How could they not? He has scored nine times in the league already this season, but now it is up to Baf\xc3\xa9timbi Gomis to pick up the slack in Bony\xe2\x80\x99s absence. The French striker\xe2\x80\x99s opportunities have been limited and he only has one Premier League goal, the winner against Arsenal in November, although it was encouraging to see him score twice in Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s 6-2 win over Tranmere Rovers in the FA Cup, while Swansea will be counting on Gylfi Sigurdsson, Wayne Routledge and Nathan Dyer to pitch in as well. Yet it is a tough first test for Monk\xe2\x80\x99s side. West Ham United are the visitors to the Liberty Stadium this weekend and Swansea have scored once in their four past matches against them. No prizes for guessing who got that goal. JS</p>  <li>Bony looks set to become a Manchester City player in days</li> <li>Sakho ruled out of Senegal\xe2\x80\x99s Africa Cup squad</li>  3) Dad\xe2\x80\x99s the word for Szczesny <p>Being embarrassed by your parents is a familiar feeling for many: the unfortunate dad-dance at a wedding, mum using an old affectionate nickname \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cWhat about these jim-jams, Fluffy-poos?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 in public. When you\xe2\x80\x99re in your mid-30s. That sort of thing. This week Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Wojciech Szczesny has had to deal with an unfortunate paternal proclamation of his own. \xe2\x80\x9cHe made a mistake for the first [Southampton] goal, coming too far from the goal, but please look at the Arsenal defence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maciej Szczesny of his under-fire son. \xe2\x80\x9cHow these guys are playing is a disaster, but for some reason, nobody pays any attention to it.\xe2\x80\x9d And Szczesny Sr wasn\xe2\x80\x99t finished, adding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe entire defence this season is an embarrassment\xe2\x80\x9d and comparing Per Mertesacker\xe2\x80\x99s agility to that of a rhinoceros. Szczesny Jr presumably met his team-mates at training with a deep breath and the time-honoured \xe2\x80\x9cDads, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d eye-roll. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger should be able to field a defence stronger than the one that wilted at the Britannia before Christmas, but too often this season they have struggled to operate effectively as a unit. Szczesny Sr\xe2\x80\x99s ill-advised intervention won\xe2\x80\x99t have helped, but Wenger will hope it does not have a further divisive effect. JA</p>  <li>Szczesny facing \xc2\xa320,000 fine for smoking in showers</li> <li>Arsenal close to sealing deal to sign Krystian Bielik </li>  4) Chelsea need more from the support acts      Pos Team P GD Pts      1 Chelsea 20 25 46    2 Man City 20 25 46    3 Man Utd 20 14 37    4 Southampton 20 19 36    5 Tottenham Hotspur 20 2 34       <p>From a position of apparent dominance, Chelsea have allowed Manchester City to chisel away at the eight-point lead they held in November, to the point where Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side are only top on alphabetical order. Suddenly it is possible to detect a little vulnerability about Chelsea, not least after the 5-3 defeat at Tottenham on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day. Defeats of that magnitude are not supposed to happen to Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s sides; you might say that they defended like a hockey team. Yet it is unlikely that they will defend as poorly as they did at White Hart Lane again this season and it would be a shock if Chelsea do not beat Newcastle United at Stamford Bridge. Put it down to a blip. Perhaps the problem is higher up the pitch because, despite the sustained excellence of Eden Hazard, Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas and Diego Costa, there are other members of the attack who are guilty of not contributing enough. Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle was replaced at half-time against Southampton and Watford after disappointing, Oscar does not always apply his wide range of gifts and Willian sometimes seems to lack that extra bit of oomph, that ability to take the game by the scruff of the neck and bend it to his will. Willian is a fine player but he would be even better with more of an end product. Those three need to do more to relieve the onus on F\xc3\xa0bregas and Hazard to provide the creative spark.

But West Brom\xe2\x80\x99s victory in the FA Cup was against Gateshead and Tony Pulis will know that the visit of Hull to the Hawthorns, rather than a spot of minnow-crushing, is exactly the sort of fixture that he has been brought in to win. Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s comments on his appointment \xe2\x80\x93 essentially: \xe2\x80\x9cGive me two weeks and I\xe2\x80\x99ll know whether I can keep this club up\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 were a little odd, given that Albion aren\xe2\x80\x99t currently in the relegation zone. \xe2\x80\x9cI need two weeks to decide whether I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be worse at this than the guy you sacked \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d was presumably not the tone he was looking for. Nevertheless, this weekend represents the half-way point of that fortnight. Albion fans will be looking out for signs that his methods are taking hold.

The three impressive years he enjoyed at Sunderland were, after all, what convinced Liverpool to splash out \xc2\xa39m on him two summers ago. Of late, though, things haven\xe2\x80\x99t quite been working out. He was dropped for \xe2\x80\x9can indefinite period\xe2\x80\x9d before Christmas after one too many blunders, but was back in the side on Boxing Day after an injury to his replacement Brad Jones. With no word on whether Jones will be back at the weekend, it appears the Belgian will get the chance to restake his claim as first choice. He was again partly culpable for AFC Wimbledon\xe2\x80\x99s goal in midweek, but if he can\xe2\x80\x99t cut out the errors on familiar territory then the writing appears to be on the wall. JA </p>  <li>Sturridge set to finish his rehabilitation from injury in Liverpool</li> <li>Balotelli could be forced to pay \xe2\x82\xac10,000 in speeding fines</li> <li>Sterling to face Sunderland after break from burnout</li>   7) Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s week on the road <p>The next week is going to be a test of Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s endurance. They were not particularly pleased about the draw with Ipswich Town in the third round of the FA Cup that means they have to go to Portman Road for the replay next Monday because it means that they now have to deal with three away games in the space of the week. It starts with Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Manchester United and ends with the long journey to Newcastle United next weekend. Ronald Koeman will have to make good use of his squad if Southampton are to stay in the Cup and hold on to their place in the top four. Yet that will not be easy. He has lost Sadio Man\xc3\xa9 to a calf injury and the influential Dusan Tadic, who played well against Arsenal on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, was lethargic against Ipswich and replaced after 66 minutes. Although Southampton are unbeaten in five matches and had positive results against Chelsea and Arsenal during the Christmas period, putting an end to talk that they cannot cope against the big sides, this may be a good time for United to play them. JS</p>  <li>Senegal and Southampton at odds over Man\xc3\xa9</li> <li>Manchester United sign Vald\xc3\xa9s as No2 goalkeeper</li> <li>When Bobby Charlton played for Waterford United in Ireland</li>  8) Will Everton go direct? <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe mixed up how we played a bit more, at times we were a bit more direct. For me that makes it easier, because when I am one v one, running on a defender, that gives me a better chance.\xe2\x80\x9d Romelu Lukaku was clearly pleased with Everton\xe2\x80\x99s tweaked approach against West Ham in the FA Cup, but Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez didn\xe2\x80\x99t offer him much encouragement that it\xe2\x80\x99s a tactic that will be maintained against Manchester City. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to use players in a specific way from game to game and against West Ham Romelu had a very effective game, I thought we used him very well, his pace and power was back to his best and he became a real threat for us,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Everton manager, whose side have managed one win in eight in the Premier League. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to remember we are in a position that every player can have a real impact and using certain players in a certain way from game to game.\xe2\x80\x9d A game-by-game approach is, of course, fair enough \xe2\x80\x93 what works against West Ham might not work against City. Flexibility is fine. But confronted by a City defence that has shown itself to be far from unflappable this season, Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s best bet might be to continue with a style that makes the most of his biggest goal threat. JA</p>  <li>Manchester City have \xe2\x80\x98no agreement with New York\xe2\x80\x99 over Lampard</li> <li>Nastasic likely to sign for Schalke for \xc2\xa310m from Manchester City</li>  9) A first away win for QPR?      Pos Team P GD Pts      15 Hull 20 -6 19    16 QPR 20 -13 19    17 West Brom 20 -10 18    18 Crystal Palace 20 -10 17    19 Burnley 20 -15 17    20 Leicester 20 -14 14       <p>Harry Redknapp\xe2\x80\x99s defence for Queens Park Rangers\xe2\x80\x99 dismal away form \xe2\x80\x93 nine games, nine defeats, four goals scored, 22 conceded \xe2\x80\x93 is that, on paper, they have not had an easy game yet. To be fair, he has a point. So far, QPR have been to Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Manchester United, Newcastle, Southampton, Swansea, Tottenham and West Ham, none of whom Redknapp\xe2\x80\x99s side would feasibly be expected to beat, so they just about get a free pass. For now, that is, because QPR will be on much shakier ground if they lose to fellow strugglers Burnley at Turf Moor. And Burnley are no pushovers. They were unfortunate to lose 2-0 at Loftus Road last month and since then they have demonstrated their potential by salvaging draws at City and Newcastle. JS </p>  <li>Z\xc3\xa1rate completes loan move to QPR for rest of season</li> <li>Burnley seal \xc2\xa32m deal for defender Keane</li>  10) Murray could be the answer for Palace <p>Alan Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s return to Crystal Palace as manager could be the jolt in the arm the Eagles need. With a morale-boosting 4-0 FA Cup win at Dover Athletic and a noisy Palace support behind him, Pardew automatically seems more at home than at any point during four years at Newcastle. Fervent excitement surrounds the club as it enters a new phase with an old boy taking the lead. Back in the Premier League however, the South London side are winless in the last seven games. While only days into his reign, Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Selhurst Park will provide the first hint of just how bold and inventive Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s Palace will be. Along with the task of containing a vastly improving Spurs side and the irrepressible Harry Kane the manager, crucially, has to find a goalscorer in his squad. Pardew may yet turn to Glenn Murrray, the man forgotten by predecessor Neil Warnock and so consistent for Palace before a serious knee injury in 2013, but still incisive after eight goals on loan at Reading during the first half of the season. He deserves an opportunity.
