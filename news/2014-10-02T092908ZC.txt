Yet no one was complaining after PSG, who were without Zlatan Ibrahimovic, had stormed to an impressive 3-2 victory over Barcelona thanks to goals from David Luiz, Marco Verratti and Blaise Matuidi. PSG have been knocking on the door in the past two seasons, unfortunate to lose tight quarter-finals against Barcelona and Chelsea, but there has never been a sense that they quite possessed the necessary belief in the crucial moments against the best sides. While beating Barcelona at this stage does not change that yet, it should do wonders for PSG\xe2\x80\x99s confidence. JS </p> Nani flatters to deceive. What\xe2\x80\x99s new?      Nani was as frustrating as ever for Sporting against Chelsea. Photograph: Patricia De Melo Moreira/AFP/Getty Images    <p>It was a puzzling performance from Nani in Sporting Lisbon\xe2\x80\x99s 1-0 defeat against Chelsea. At times, he was a genuine menace and went as close as anyone to scoring an equaliser with a late drive that flew inches wide but on the whole he was as wonderfully exasperating as ever, at one point ruining a promising Sporting attack by mistaking the referee for a team-mate and trying to set him up for a goal with a backheel that would have been the finest assist of the week if anyone had been making an overlapping run alongside Nani. It was a moment that summed up his career: his imagination and skill undone by his inability to make the right choice. His is a virtuoso talent and there is a feeling that Manchester United did not use him properly (as Rob Smyth wrote in this excellent piece last month) but Nani seems destined to frustrate more often than he thrills. JS</p> Ludogorets lacking a bit of luck     The Bulgarians managed to frustrate Cristiano Ronaldo for large parts of the match. Photograph: Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP/Getty Images    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn comparison to Real Madrid we are a tiny club, almost nothing, and many people didn\xe2\x80\x99t know us until today,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Ludogorets midfielder Marcelinho, who opened the scoring in his side\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 defeat at the hands of reigning champions Real Madrid at the Vasil Levski stadium last night. Real\xe2\x80\x99s eventual come-from-behind victory was laboured and the Bulgarian champions can probably feel aggrieved that, despite spirited and classy performances against Liverpool and Real, they are still living up to their pre-tournament tag as Group B whipping boys. </p> <p>They may well sit bottom of the table with no points from two games, but on the evidence of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen thus far, it is inexperience and bad luck rather than any lack of ability that has consigned them there. With four games to go, they may yet have a big say in who advances to the knockout stages.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe are probably not the best team in our group but we\xe2\x80\x99ll keep on giving our all to stay in Europe as long as possible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ludogorets midfielder Mihail Alexandrov in the wake of last night\xe2\x80\x99s heart-breaking defeat. It is abundantly clear that Ludogorets are not the best team in their group, but on current form and the evidence of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen thus far, the identity of the worst is not so obvious. BG</p> <p></p> Bayern fans improvise and Hulk gets angry <p> Despite a group of 70 Bayern Munich fans having booked their travel to Russia for their match against CSKA Moscow before it was announced the game would be played behind closed doors as punishment for racist chanting by CSKA fans last season, Uefa stood firm and refused to admit the fans to the Arena Khimki. </p> <p>Determined to see the match, the travelling party hired the entire floor of an adjacent skyscraper, from where the photo below was taken. Bayern Munich have since announced they will reimburse them and foot the tab for the rental of the impromptu viewing gallery. </p> <p>A post on the Football Supporters Europe Facebook page suggests people clearly visible in attendance at a match Uefa were so determined to have played in an empty stadium are among 300 folk invited by sponsors, who European football\xe2\x80\x99s governing body seem rather less willing to inconvenience or upset. </p>    <p>Baut mehr Hochh\xc3\xa4user neben Fu\xc3\x9fballstadien! Viele Gr\xc3\xbc\xc3\x9fe von nebenan ;) @Sky_Kai #CSKAFCB pic.twitter.com/9ijvZWdgzP</p>&mdash; Club Nr. 12 (@clubnr12) September 30, 2014    <p>Of course no footballer should ever have to endure racist abuse and elsewhere in Russia, Hulk was understandably furious at being subjected to monkey chants by visiting Spartak Moscow fans during a Russian league match at the Petrovsky Stadium last weekend. </p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was coming from a large group of people...I take this as a personal insult for me and my club,\xe2\x80\x9d the Brazil international said in the build-up to a dreary Champions League encounter in which his fine performance was one of very few highlights.</p> <p>While Hulk has every right to be upset by the racism of knucklehead Russian football fans, it is rather more difficult to sympathise with his club in this or any other instance. Zenit St Petersburg supporters are arguably the worst in Europe when it comes to racially abusing opposition players and as recently as 2012, their largest supporters\xe2\x80\x99 club, Landscrona published a manifesto demanding the club field an all-white, heterosexual team. </p> <p>At the time, Jonathan Wilson explained that, for all its flaws, the open letter Landscrona sent to their club was \xe2\x80\x9ca much more nuanced and interesting document than anybody reading only the British press would have realised\xe2\x80\x9d. Despite Zenit officials rejecting the fans\xe2\x80\x99 demands out of hand, it seems rather odd that the big money signing who unwittingly prompted Zenit fans to metaphorically nail their theses to the door of the Petrovsky Stadium is the same one who earlier this week complained about racist followers of another team insulting his club.

Winners and losers     Basel manager Paulo Sousa celebrates with Basel\xe2\x80\x99s matchwinner, Marco Streller. Photograph: Patrick Straub/AP    <p>Winners ... Paulo Sousa: In describing his side\xe2\x80\x99s win over Liverpool as \xe2\x80\x9cglorious, historic, for me, the players, the fans and the club\xe2\x80\x9d, Paulo Sousa may have been over-egging the pudding slightly. </p> <p>Even by recent standards, Liverpool were something of a shambles last night and their baffling inability to defend routine set pieces inevitably gifted the points to a Basel side that should really have won by more. The Swiss champions have no shortage of previous in the field of upsetting English opposition, having beaten Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United at St. Jakob-Park in the past three years. Considering Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s recent poor form, this was nowhere near as big an upset as some would have us believe. Indeed, the home side\xe2\x80\x99s pre-match odds of 5-2 looked exceptionally generous. </p> <p>For all that, Sousa has endured problems of his own this season. Despite leading his side to the top of the Swiss top flight and winning eight out of 12 matches in Swiss League and Champions League, an online petition calling for the managers head has been set up by fans frustrated by what they see as his incessant tinkering. They were also angered by his eagerness to get Cristiano Ronaldo\xe2\x80\x99s shirt in the wake of Basel\xe2\x80\x99s 5-1 thrashing at the hands of Real Madrid two weeks ago.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI have my ideas of football and I\xe2\x80\x99m working to develop these characteristics of my players,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sousa before last night\xe2\x80\x99s game. His team\xe2\x80\x99s performance against surprisingly obliging opposition should earn him breathing space. BG </p> <p>Losers ... Athletic Bilbao: Like Real Sociedad last season, Athletic Bilbao are not finding it easy to acclimatise to the Champions League after finishing fourth in La Liga. Ernesto Valverde\xe2\x80\x99s side excelled by beating Rafael Benitez\xe2\x80\x99s Napoli in their qualifier but it has been difficult for them since then. They are 16th in La Liga after picking up four points in their first six matches and although a 0-0 home draw with Shakhtar Donetsk in their opening group match was an acceptable result for Athletic, Tuesday night\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 defeat at BATE Borisov, the supposed whipping boys of Group H, was a disastrous result. It leaves them in a complicated position at the bottom of the group and Valverde admitted he was concerned by the performance; Athletic were 2-0 down before they got going and gave themselves too much to do. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had the wrong approach to the game,\xe2\x80\x9d Valverde said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were much better than us and deserved the win. We showed more intensity after the restart but our performance in the opening half leaves me with a bad taste. We have taken a big step back, without a doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d They need to rediscover their spark quickly. JS</p> It\xe2\x80\x99s stat time again \xe2\x80\xa6    <p>54 - Cristiano Ronaldo now has 54 goals in 53 Champions League appearances for Real Madrid. Ludicrous.</p>&mdash; OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) October 1, 2014      <p>Arsenal have had 15 players sent off in the CL, equal to Galatasaray. Only Inter (17) and Juve (20) have received more red cards.</p>&mdash; Infostrada Sports (@InfostradaLive) October 1, 2014      <p>4 - Basel have won each of their last four Champions League games against English sides. Faulty.</p>&mdash; OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) October 1, 2014      <p>0 - @Atleti were the first club not to concede a single shot on target in a CL game vs Juventus since @Arsenal in March 2006.

He&#39;s never scored in England, has he? #CityvRoma</p>&mdash; Manchester City FC (@MCFC) September 30, 2014    <p>Surely whichever genius runs Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Twitter feed knew that they were tempting fate when they engaged in \xe2\x80\x9cbanter\xe2\x80\x9d with their Roma counterparts and pointed out that Francesco Totti had never scored in England? Everyone knew what was coming next and, sure enough, Totti was running through on goal a few hours later to become the latest Italian veteran to dink a ball over Joe Hart. \xe2\x80\x9cCity\xe2\x80\x99s tweet? It really brought me luck,\xe2\x80\x9d Totti said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a beautiful goal and a good performance.\xe2\x80\x9d And you\xe2\x80\x99d have thought Roma would have learned from this episode too. But no \xe2\x80\xa6 JS</p>    <p>Thanks for the hospitality last night @mcfc. Looking forward to seeing you in Rome. You&#39;ve never won a European game in Italy, have you?</p>&mdash; AS Roma (@OfficialASRoma) October 1, 2014  '
