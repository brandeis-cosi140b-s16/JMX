b'Richard Money: Cambridge hit jackpot with Manchester United FA Cup tie'


b'<p>Cambridge United need not have worried about replacing the toilets at the Abbey Stadium, something their chairman promised to do after holding Manchester United to a goalless draw in the FA Cup. Now five companies are offering such facilities for nothing at the creaking ground, one of the many perks the League Two club are savouring before their big night at Old Trafford.</p> <p>A famous result has got them as far as this and, even if they do not progress further in the competition, the benefits should remain for years to come. Cambridge are likely to earn more than \xc2\xa31m from Tuesday night\xe2\x80\x99s fourth-round replay in Manchester, income that will have lasting, tangible effects at a club who returned to the Football League only last year after a nine-year hiatus.</p> <p>A gym at the training ground, a facility for the youth academy \xe2\x80\x93 commodities taken for granted elsewhere \xe2\x80\x93 will be the legacy spawned by a Premier League side\xe2\x80\x99s profligacy. Manchester United were bitterly disappointed after failing to beat a team ranked 82nd in the English pyramid but in the end even Louis van Gaal may not begrudge Cambridge a windfall that could have a decisive impact on their immediate future.</p> <p>Sixty-four coaches and 6,500 supporters will make the trip north for an evening to be remembered. Amid the hubbub of pre-match hype there was one word used by both the manager, Richard Money, and the chief executive, Jez George: respect. Cambridge want to leave with their heads held high, returning to the Abbey with reputation enhanced and galvanised for the remainder of the season.</p> <p>Such has been the mood for the past week and a half, with Cambridge buoyed by increased exposure and renewed local interest. Money compared drawing United out of the hat to winning a Las Vegas jackpot and now the club have a ticket in the EuroMillions.</p> <p>For Dave Doggett, the club\xe2\x80\x99s chairman and a fan since 1957, there have been other fruitful times but few in recent memory. After initially claiming funds from the replay would be used to give the stadium a lick of paint and new toilets, he has been inundated with proposals.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFive toilet manufacturers came to us offering free urinals and what have you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe could have toilets in one stand dedicated to one manufacturer and others elsewhere in the ground. So I\xe2\x80\x99m raising the stakes now \xe2\x80\x93 we need a new stand if someone would like to offer us one.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>More significant has been the shift in local attitude towards the club. In 2013 the council did not back plans for a stadium elsewhere in the city but Doggett has noted a change in tone from many within Cambridge since the hard-fought 0-0 draw.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey [the council] didn\xe2\x80\x99t identify the need for a football club and sporting facilities; they said we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t demonstrated it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we have demonstrated it now. They all want to be part of it. It\xe2\x80\x99s great for the town. We are not just a university town, we are a football town.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Cambridge\xe2\x80\x99s heroics were almost lost during an FA Cup weekend that produced some incredible results. Bradford City\xe2\x80\x99s victory at Chelsea the following day dominated the headlines but Tuesday night\xe2\x80\x99s fixture represents another opportunity under the spotlight for Money\xe2\x80\x99s side. Since Van Gaal and co rolled into town Cambridge have drawn with Dagenham &amp; Redbridge and lost to Luton but Money hopes he will not have to introduce himself to the Dutchman this time.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI introduced myself to him before the game because I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure he would know who I was,\xe2\x80\x9d Money said. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought that was the courteous thing to do. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want an embarrassing situation on the touchline. You shake hands before the game as you usually do and he would be wondering who was the coach, so I made a point of introducing myself to him as we walked out the tunnel.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI shook his hand [at full-time]. I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked abroad. It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy sometimes. Things get lost in translation and it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy. Ryan [Giggs] and his staff came in afterwards and were very complimentary. I probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the manager because I spent so much time with the press. They\xe2\x80\x99re at home tomorrow and we may get more of a chance to spend a bit of time after the game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Cambridge\xe2\x80\x99s players will look to savour every moment. United donated their shirts without asking for one in return after the first game but may not be as generous on the pitch for a successive match after producing such a tepid display at the Abbey.</p> <p>For Cambridge and Money, though, they have already won. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you go to Las Vegas and you play those fruit machines and you win the jackpot \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s probably what the draw was, in terms of Cambridge versus Man United,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTo get the replay probably means we bought a lottery ticket and won. Now we\xe2\x80\x99ve bought a EuroMillions ticket.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe percentage of chance diminishes because of it but because you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a ticket you do have a chance. That\xe2\x80\x99s how I feel. To go there with no belief would be dangerous but we\xe2\x80\x99re well aware of the task in front of us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
