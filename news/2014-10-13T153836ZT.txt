b'POUND STERLING <p>Alan Shearer this afternoon reacted with fury after Raheem Sterling admitted to feeling a little bit peckish. \xe2\x80\x9cPeckish? I\xe2\x80\x99ll bet he had a perfectly decent lunch and it\xe2\x80\x99s barely 3.30,\xe2\x80\x9d the former England striker opined. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard anything like it. Once I\xe2\x80\x99ve had lunch I personally wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t admit to feeling even remotely hungry until 6.30 at the very earliest, and given that I always have my tea at 6, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense then either.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>There were also questions from Jamie Carragher, unhappy at how rumours that the quicksilver tyro itched his nose during training had been revealed. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be too busy giving 110% to even think about having an itch,\xe2\x80\x9d the Liverpool legend raged. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re diving into tackles or honing your death-defying last-ditch flying-block skills, even if your nose would like to feel itchy your brain doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have time to tell you about it. I\xe2\x80\x99m not totally sure but I think that\xe2\x80\x99s medically correct.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I do know for absolutely certain is that when I was at Liverpool every now and then some kid from the youth team would stroll in itching and scratching and you\xe2\x80\x99d know right then and there he\xe2\x80\x99d never get anywhere in the game. I guarantee I never saw that kind of nonsense from the great players I was lucky enough to play with at the club, the likes of $tevie or Fernando Torres or Dietmar Hamann. The day I feel itchy in training will be the day I decide to hang up my boots. Which I have already done. And I never even felt itchy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The news makes it inevitable that there will be further questions about Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s application, only days after he was caught on video repeatedly blinking. There have been some questions asked about whether it was ethically responsible to release the footage \xe2\x80\x93 which was taken using hidden cameras by a notorious tabloid journalist famous for catching celebrities in compromising situations through the use of intricate ruses and a veneer of wealth and influence, better known as the Gobbledygook Duke \xe2\x80\x93 but it has now been viewed on YouTube nearly eight times.</p> <p>Meanwhille, in the real world, the Liverpool-based controversy magnet was criticised over the weekend for feeling tired \xe2\x80\x93 despite having had three weeks off in the last year and a half \xe2\x80\x93 while he was also picked on by television pundits after slow-motion replays indicated a suspicious movement in or around his chest during the Euro 2016 qualifier against San Marino. But Gary Lineker took to Twitter to defend the under-fire forward. \xe2\x80\x9cThough I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember ever doing it deliberately, I\xe2\x80\x99m almost certain that I also breathed during matches,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote England\xe2\x80\x99s record goalscorer-but-one. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s young, we should cut him some slack.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Simon Burnton is in the Euro 2016 qualifier hot seat tonight. Keep him company from 7.45pm BST.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY I <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI never mentioned that the players were using drugs \xe2\x80\xa6 maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s due to the pollution in China that players had blocked noses all the time\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Brazil coach Dunga says the pinched nose gesture he directed at Argentina players during Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s 2-0 win was alluding to the Beijing smog and nothing at all to do with him spuriously accusing them of having been busy with the special marching powder.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY II     Claudio Ranieri watches his Greek side. Photograph: Kimmo Brandt/EPA    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou are my friend? [Effing] hell! You are a very dangerous man. I am used to being under pressure. My job is hard but I love this job\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 potty-mouthed Tinkerman Claudio Ranieri effs and jeffs at a reporter who suggested the Greece manager could lose his job after only three matches should they lose to Norn Iron tomorrow night.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY III <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat Tejada is an animal. All week he talked against Forsyth, who ignored him and said nothing. No one knows the reason for his hatred. He\xe2\x80\x99s sick. George Forsyth is an exemplary Peruvian. Peru opened its doors to Tejada and he behaves like a horse\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Harold Forsyth, Peru\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador to the USA! USA!! USA!!! and father of Alianza Lima keeper George, takes a Twitter pop at C\xc3\xa9sar Vallejo striker Luis Tejada after an incident during a game over the weekend. \xe2\x80\x9cI apologise for yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s inappropriate phrase,\xe2\x80\x9d parped Forsyth Snr today.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel.

They\xe2\x80\x99ll spend years working with him, nurturing him, turning him into a polished performer \xe2\x80\xa6 then he\xe2\x80\x99ll do one to Ukip\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Marc Sinfield.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cA film about Ghana\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup million-dollar bonuses (Friday\xe2\x80\x99s Bits and Bobs), hot on the heels of a film about Sepp Blatter saving football \xe2\x80\xa6 it\xe2\x80\x99s all too glamorous. I look forward to Ken Loach redressing the balance with a dismal, behind-the-scenes drama set in the England dressing room. A tense start with recriminations after the defeat by Italy, an explosion of angst after Uruguay, and then a descending spiral towards a satisfyingly ignoble end at Luton airport. It\xe2\x80\x99ll look good in black and white\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Charles Antaki.</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
