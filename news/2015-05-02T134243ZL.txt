b'Leicester City v Newcastle United: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>What a brilliant win for Leicester. What a disaster for Newcastle. The jig was up after 17 minutes for the visitors. They are now perilously close to the relegation zone. Leicester are just a point behind them. They\xe2\x80\x99re booed off by the travelling fans. As for the home team, they\xe2\x80\x99re given a rousing reception by the Leicester fans, whose support was tremendous all through the game. Leicester also have the best goal difference of the teams in and around the bottom now too. Pearson will have to be creative to get angry in his press conference. Carver may need to use hypnotism to give his team a lift for the final three games. That\xe2\x80\x99s eight losses in a row. There\xe2\x80\x99d be a strange kind of glory in that if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so serious. Right, I\xe2\x80\x99m off. Thanks for your emails. Bye. </p>     The Newcastle fans\xe2\x80\x99 protest continues after the final whistle. Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images  '
