b'Manuel Pellegrini says Manchester City are hitting form at right time'


b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini believes Manchester City are now showing why they are champions after the 3-0 win over Crystal Palace, a sixth consecutive Premier League victory that drew them level at the top of the table with Chelsea.</p> <p>Goals on 49 and 61 minutes from David Silva plus Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s late strike mean City, playing without a recognised striker due to injuries to Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic, now trail Chelsea, who face Stoke on Monday, only on goal difference on 39 points.</p> <p>Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe nobody believed one or two months ago we can continue in Champions League and be involved in the title fight but we always trust in what we do and the way we work and that is why I am so happy the squad is demonstrating why we won the title last year.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The City manager believes that the seasonal fixtures could prove pivotal for his club. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that December is a key month,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe it is not the month you win the title but it is a month where you play so many games that if you want to be involved and have chances for the title, you must be as near as you can be to the lead of the table. We are in a good moment.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea can re-establish a three-point lead if they win at Stoke. Asked if there was pressure on Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side, Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think [about] what happens with Chelsea, if they feel the pressure or not. The only important thing for our team was just to win three more points and continue the way we are and believe we can be involved in the fight for the title.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>City visit West Bromwich Albion on Boxing Day before facing Burnley two days later and Sunderland on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, and Pellegrini believes a number of important players are finding optimum form. \xe2\x80\x9cI said when our midfielders Yaya, Fernandinho, Nasri, Silva return to their normal performance, the team will play again the way we normally do.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Neil Warnock described the decision to disallow James McArthur\xe2\x80\x99s second half goal for offside as \xe2\x80\x9cdisgraceful\xe2\x80\x9d, after what appeared to be the wrong call from the assistant Peter Kirkup when the score was 2-0.</p>'
