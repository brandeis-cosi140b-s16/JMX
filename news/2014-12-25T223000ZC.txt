b'Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho regrets \xe2\x80\x98stupid and silly\xe2\x80\x99 criticism of West Ham'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has described his criticism that West Ham played \xe2\x80\x9c19th-century football\xe2\x80\x9d at Stamford Bridge last season as \xe2\x80\x9cstupid, silly words\xe2\x80\x9d and lavished praise on the impact made by his opposite number, Sam Allardyce, as the teams prepare to meet again on Boxing Day.</p> <p>The visitors arrive in west London in the top four at Christmas for the first time in almost 30 years, their tally of 31 points an improvement of 17 on this time last year when West Ham had languished fourth from bottom. The unlikely goalless draw secured at Chelsea at the end of January had been chiselled out after one win in 10 league games and a humiliation in the Capital One Cup semi-final against Manchester City.</p> <p>But, while it provoked that infamous criticism from Mourinho, it inspired a four-game winning streak which effectively sent West Ham towards safety. \xe2\x80\x9cLast season they were in big trouble and, when you are fighting for relegation every point is a point, you have to do everything to get points,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Portuguese. \xe2\x80\x9cSo yes, it was a turning point for them. It gave them the confidence that they needed and after that they kept in the division.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLast season I had a couple of words about the \xe2\x80\xa6 not about the way they played but about the way they started wasting time after two minutes of the game, which I don\xe2\x80\x99t like. But I respect Sam Allardyce as a coach, and as a person he is a very good guy. As a coach he has a beautiful career and I\xe2\x80\x99m happy that he\xe2\x80\x99s doing well with West Ham.\xe2\x80\x9d Asked specifically about the \xe2\x80\x9c19th-century football\xe2\x80\x9d line, Mourinho added: \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, stupid, silly words.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Chelsea manager, who has never lost a game over the festive season while managing in England, spent time with Allardyce over the summer while the pair coached their respective Rest of the World and England squads in a Soccer Aid charity match at Old Trafford, with that involvement having helped repair their relationship from that occasion back in January.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf they finish top four, then manager of the season is Big Sam, the team of the season West Ham, because it would be an amazing achievement comparing West Ham with the investment that other teams did to finish in the top four,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mourinho.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut why not? Sam deserves respect. He has my respect. Both teams are different from last season. We are a better team, we have more creativity, we have more goals, we have more attacking dynamism. And West Ham is also a better team. They are not a team in this moment to just try not to concede. They also try to score goals, so the game will be very difficult.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou see the way they play every game: they are a better team, they have better players and, also, Big Sam is showing now he is not what people sometimes say: a defensive coach who only knows how to play defensively, direct and long balls. He\xe2\x80\x99s giving a completely different image about himself, which can make the game more difficult for us obviously but, at the same time, more attractive for everyone.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
