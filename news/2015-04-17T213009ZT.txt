b'Tim Sherwood feels no pressure to give Aston Villa FA Cup edge over Liverpool'


b'<p>Tim Sherwood believes that all the pressure will be on Liverpool in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup semi-final at Wembley and hopes his resurgent Aston Villa side can capitalise on the weight of expectation on Brendan Rodgers and his players. The Villa manager said that, whereas winning the Cup would be regarded as a \xe2\x80\x9cpriority\xe2\x80\x9d for Liverpool, his players viewed the prospect of silverware as an unexpected bonus.</p> <p>Looking as relaxed as he hopes his players will be come kick-off at Wembley, Sherwood was on good form as he talked about the letter he wrote back to the six-year-old Villa supporter who applied for the manager\xe2\x80\x99s job when Paul Lambert was sacked \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cI said to him: \xe2\x80\x98No hard feelings, good luck next time\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 and offered a fresh, tongue-in-cheek, take on that footage of Raheem Sterling inhaling nitrous oxide. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s hope he\xe2\x80\x99s not laughing after Sunday,\xe2\x80\x9d Sherwood said.</p> <p>The Villa manager did, to be fair, make it clear that he was not condoning Sterling for his actions but also admitted he had a \xe2\x80\x9cwee bit of sympathy\xe2\x80\x9d for a player he tried to take to Tottenham Hotspur after watching him in action for Brent District at the age of 14.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a street footballer, a dribbler \xe2\x80\x93 dribble down the alleyway, a fantastic talent. Everyone knew about Raheem when he was at QPR and tried to get him. Liverpool were the fortunate ones. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure Tottenham wanted to spend the money which was asked at the time. He\xe2\x80\x99s made the correct decision because he\xe2\x80\x99s gone to a club with a manager who wants to give him the opportunity to play.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Keeping Sterling quiet will be one of the priorities for Sherwood as Villa aim to reach their first FA Cup final since losing to Chelsea in 2000. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s a bonus for us and a priority for Liverpool,\xe2\x80\x9d Sherwood said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not saying we\xe2\x80\x99re taking this game lightly because we\xe2\x80\x99re not; we want to get this great club to Wembley and a final.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut I think the pressure is on them a lot more. They need to be winning trophies \xe2\x80\x93 Liverpool football club have demanded that for centuries now. We hope they\xe2\x80\x99re a bit edgy and nervy with it. We\xe2\x80\x99re trying to capitalise on any advantage we possibly have.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Christian Benteke, with eight goals in his past six league matches, will carry Villa\xe2\x80\x99s threat alongside Gabriel Agbonlahor, who is expected to be passed fit after recovering from a hamstring problem. Benteke has been back to his best in recent weeks but will have only two years remaining on his contract come the summer and Sherwood admitted that Villa could be forced to sell their prize asset if the player cannot be talked into signing an extension.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want to sell our best players,\xe2\x80\x9d Sherwood said. \xe2\x80\x9cI also want players who want to play at the football club. He\xe2\x80\x99s made no indication to me that he wants to play elsewhere. If he does, then we will assess the situation but we want to keep him at the club.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t force any player \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been one myself. You might as well take the money because you end up without the money or the player if you don\xe2\x80\x99t take it. It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly something that will have to be addressed. You don\xe2\x80\x99t really want players going into the last 18 months of their contract. He\xe2\x80\x99s someone for the long-term future of the club and you need to protect your interests.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Sherwood confirmed that Shay Given, who is Brad Guzan\xe2\x80\x99s understudy in the Premier League, would start in goal against Liverpool, in keeping with the manager\xe2\x80\x99s selection policy in the previous rounds of the FA Cup.</p> <p>Nathan Baker is set to come in for the injured Ciaran Clark in central defence with Ashley Westwood likely to replace the suspended Carlos S\xc3\xa1nchez in midfield as Villa look to pull off the upset that would ruin Steven Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s hopes of bowing out of English football with an FA Cup final appearance. \xe2\x80\x9cBelieve it or not, it\xe2\x80\x99s not about spoiling the party for Steven Gerrard, it\xe2\x80\x99s about what we can do,\xe2\x80\x9d Sherwood said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, to be honest, we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping that he\xe2\x80\x99s on his holiday in May.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
