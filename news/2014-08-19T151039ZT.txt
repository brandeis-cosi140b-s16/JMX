b'ARSENAL: THE DARK WORLD <p>Mj\xc3\xb6lnir was the name of the hammer of Thor, a weapon so mighty it could raze mountains. For centuries this awesome tool of destruction was presumed lost but, in 1998, it was unearthed by France centre-back Laurent Blanc, who promptly used it in that year\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup semi-final to clobber Slaven Bilic, if the Croat\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to contact from Blanc was anything to by.</p> <p>Happily, the referee on that occasion was familiar with Norse mythology and knew that the only cure to being smitten by a mj\xc3\xb6lnir is the sight of a red card, and as soon as one was shown to Blanc, Bilic was back on his feet quicker than you could say \xe2\x80\x9cshameless bloody weasel whose action dragged an entire sport that little bit closer to hell\xe2\x80\x9d. The Fiver only mentions this to remind Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger that Bilic has a record of plotting the ejection of Frenchmen from prestigious tournaments, so the Arsenal manager best be on on his guard when his team take on Bilic\xe2\x80\x99s Besiktas in tonight\xe2\x80\x99s Big Cup play-off first leg.</p> <p>Arsenal have won all 12 of the Big Cup play-offs they have previously contested and doubtless Wenger won\xe2\x80\x99t be put off by any talk of 13 being unlucky even if someone mentions that one of the reasons that number is considered inauspicious is because the 13th god in the Norse pantheon was Loki, a sly shape-shifter who once nicked mjollnir and wound up being bound by human entrails as he was doused in snake poison. What Wenger is perturbed by, however, is the prospect of his players being tired because they have to play three difficult matches in a week. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had a short preparation and we know that in one week we have three big games: Besiktas home and away and Everton in between,\xe2\x80\x9d fretted Wenger, as squeamish listeners begged the Arsenal manager not to disclose any further details of his team\xe2\x80\x99s harrowing ordeal.</p> <p>The ever-heartless Bilic was unsympathetic. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve got such a quality squad, such a big squad, and the same manager for 18 years \xe2\x80\x93 to say they are not ready is out of question,\xe2\x80\x9d quibbled the Besiktas manager before stressing how focused his players are on preventing Arsenal from progressing. \xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t be doing on-the-pitch selfies with Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez, Arteta or Giroud,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Bilic in a transparent dig at Arsenal players\xe2\x80\x99 tendency to inundate social media with triumphant photos after winning coin tosses. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not here to swap shirts with them. No! We have a plan and we\xe2\x80\x99re a big club too. Arsenal are the favourites, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll do our best,\xe2\x80\x9d warned Bilic.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Paul Doyle from 7.45pm BST for MBM coverage of Besiktas 1-1 Arsenal, followed by John Ashdown\xe2\x80\x99s coverage of Real Madrid 3-1 Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe got an Icelandic girlfriend and then I came along.

While he was at Nasty Leeds, Aunt Bessie\xe2\x80\x99s Yorkshire Puddings sponsored him. They would give him puddings for each goal he scored, and he scored quite a few. Surely he still has a few in a deep freeze somewhere to grease the wheels of lower-league Ghanaian football?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Darren Leathley.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs a pedant and physics graduate, imagine my joy as the Fiver went into a field so famed for specific measurable values and pedantry (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver). However, a quick review of the figures quoted and I realised that \xe2\x80\x93 as the Fiver says \xe2\x80\x93 no one really knows. Moreover, I think any pedant willing to share data and calculations to the contrary either needs a Nobel Prize or to stop making things up. I then investigated briefly if Heisenberg\xe2\x80\x99s uncertainty principle could apply to mean that position and time could not be known at the same time with accuracy making a mockery of Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s comments, however this also was a dead end of pedantry. I did think about finishing on a description of the quantum observer behaviour of Fernando Torres but had lost the will\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Phil Smith.</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
