b'Arsenal v Monaco: Champions League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened  | Scott Murray'


b'<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s that. Oh Arsenal. A little chink of light courtesy of Oxlade-Chamberlain ... and then thanks to a mistake by the same player, Arsenal are in a worse position than they were before their goal flew in, away goals and all that. Can they become only the third team in Champions League history, after Ajax and Inter, to turn around a home deficit in the knockout stages? Yes, of course it\xe2\x80\x99s possible, though they\xe2\x80\x99ll need to be as brilliant in the principality as they were dreadful in London tonight. Giroud, Ozil and Mertesacker all suffered shockers. But for Monaco, Abdennour, Martial, Moutinho and - gallingly, for Arsenal fans - Berbatov were magnificent. They thoroughly deserved their victory, and by this thumping margin, too. \xe2\x80\x9cCould Arsenal fans argue that today\xe2\x80\x99s issue of a certain tea-timely football-related e-mail perhaps baited Berbatov and Monaco?\xe2\x80\x9d wonders Sarah Rothwell, referencing the work of some clown who shall remain unnamed. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, that would also suggest that Berbatov, much like myself, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have much of a life and actually reads the Fiver, so never mind...\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Arsene Wenger.
