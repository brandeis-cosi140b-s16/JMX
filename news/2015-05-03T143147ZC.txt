b'Chelsea crowned Premier League champions after Crystal Palace win \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened | Jacob Steinberg'


b'<p>It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t pretty today. It was a slog. It was tough to watch at times. But from Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s perspective, it was worth it in the end. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a performance that will win over the neutrals or make the accusations of tedium go away, while there are bound to be a few grumbles over the way that Eden Hazard won his penalty. But Kevin Friend\xe2\x80\x99s final whistle brought confirmation of what has been on the cards for a long time: Chelsea are the champions of England for the first time since 2010. They have been the best team, Hazard has been the best player and Jose Mourinho has been the best manager. Congratulations are in order. Now they have to retain it. Thanks for reading. Bye. I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you with Daniel Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s match report.</p>'
