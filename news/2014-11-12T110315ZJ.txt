He was linked with the Leeds vacancy in September, but BBC Radio Derby reports he is now close to replacing Gary Rowett at Burton. The 42-year-old last worked in England as a coach for Steve McClaren at Nottingham Forest.</p> <p>After he turned down a new deal at Antwerp in May, Hasselbaink said: \xe2\x80\x9cAt this moment I am looking for opportunities. I am open-minded but the perfect scenario would be a job in England.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI still live in England, my wife is English and my kids go to school here so that would be the best and easiest option. I want an exciting challenge that I know I can make better off the field and on it.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAt Royal Antwerp I basically did everything \xe2\x80\x93 fitness, recruitment, tactics \xe2\x80\x93 everything. Now I am ready to take a job with more staff.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
