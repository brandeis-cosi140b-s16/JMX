b'THE SQUARE IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE <p>When using popular online search-engine-related translation services, it is often wise not to take the results too seriously. The Fiver was however shaken to discover that the preview to tonight\xe2\x80\x99s England game in the leading Lithuanian daily newspaper Kauno Diena exhorts the nation\xe2\x80\x99s players to \xe2\x80\x9cobey the voice of the blood\xe2\x80\x9d. Immediately the Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s imagination, when conjuring images of tonight\xe2\x80\x99s possible key moments, replaced a merry picture of a grinning Wayne Rooney celebrating a history-making hat-trick with something that looked distressingly like the climactic scenes of Carrie.</p> <p>Before we get carried away, it must be said that the software seems to struggle with Lithuanian. Still, it\xe2\x80\x99s all we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go on, so we must report that Arminas Narbekovas, who won Olympic gold as part of the USSR football team in Seoul in 1988, reckons tonight\xe2\x80\x99s team should \xe2\x80\x9csurprise those who do not believe in you\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cprove that the square is not impossible\xe2\x80\x9d, while the former striker Edgaras Jankauskas thinks they should \xe2\x80\x9cjust give it your all forces\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy can not we be surprised to host their holidays in the fortress?\xe2\x80\x9d he asks, not without reason.</p> <p>Sadly if the bookmakers are to be believed, Lithuania won\xe2\x80\x99t be hosting holidays in the fortress any time soon, with England widely listed at the prohibitively miserly odds of 1-9, while upwards of 33-1 is available for an away win (we say away \xe2\x80\x93 London is the sixth biggest Lithuanian city, if ranked by the total number of Lithuanian residents. Even discounting those who have flown in for tonight\xe2\x80\x99s match Britain\xe2\x80\x99s capital hosts enough Lithuanians to fill Wembley on their own, and if current trends continue is likely to hit the top three by the end of the decade and replace Vilnius to become their capital as well, in some kind of democratically questionable capital-sharing arrangement, sometime towards the end of this century).</p> <p>Marijonas Mikutavi\xc4\x8dius, Lithuanian talk-show host, comedian and singer, whose song Trys Milijonai has become the nation\xe2\x80\x99s unofficial sporting anthem, is responsible for the most troubling pre-match image. \xe2\x80\x9cI am old England fans,\xe2\x80\x9d he admits. \xe2\x80\x9cIn Soviet times, English football reached us more than the other Western European championships. However, the sentiment does not mean that today I have questions for you to suffer. When playing Lithuanians, speaks the voice of the blood.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Crikey. Here we were hoping that Lithuania would yield to the force of the Kane, and instead they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be busy obeying the voice of the blood. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, other bodily fluids may also be involved, with the Lithuanian FA\xe2\x80\x99s online preview warning London to prepare for the arrival of \xe2\x80\x9ca yellow-stained army\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cEngland have very good players,\xe2\x80\x9d Jankauskas concludes, \xe2\x80\x9cbut if we look with fear at once, it starts to lose the game. They will remain invincible monsters.\xe2\x80\x9d </p> <p>Many words have been used to describe this England team in recent years, but this is almost certainly the first time \xe2\x80\x9cinvincible\xe2\x80\x9d has come into play. If the competitively-dubious Euro 2016 qualifying campaign has given us nothing else, let us at least celebrate this. While we can.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY     Damn! Photograph: Gustau Nacarino/Reuters    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe contacted [Him about] exactly how to do it, how to stop Bale. But he didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer the call\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Israel coach Eli Guttman reveals that Him, probably to his dismay, passed up a perfectly good opportunity to bring Gareth Bale down another peg or two.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn response to John Stainton\xe2\x80\x99s allusion to Eric Cantona being Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s greatest ever player (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s letters), this will come as a great shock to those Stretford Enders fortunate enough to see the likes of George Best, Duncan Edwards, and Bobby Charlton, for example. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost as if football was invented in 1992. What?
