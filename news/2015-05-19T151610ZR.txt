b'Raheem Sterling has exposed flaws in Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s desire to play fair'


b'<p>The news will have struck with force in Boston and might, just might, prompt Fenway Sports Group to revise the strategy it has pursued at Liverpool since acquiring the club at the high court in October 2010. We are talking of Michel Platini\xe2\x80\x99s announcement that Uefa is easing its rules on financial fair play, of course, not Raheem Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s desire to quit Anfield this summer. Although the two are inextricably linked.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have moved forward on Liverpool except for the passage of FFP,\xe2\x80\x9d John W Henry, FSG\xe2\x80\x99s principal owner, told the Guardian\xe2\x80\x99s David Conn 12 months after the fraught takeover from the almost ruinous ownership of Tom Hicks and George Gillett. Since then, FSG has operated in line with Platini\xe2\x80\x99s ideals while bemoaning the loopholes within FFP that other clubs have exploited.</p>  <p> Related: Raheem Sterling to ask for Liverpool exit with Manchester City on alert </p>   <p>Raising Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s commercial revenue from \xc2\xa362m in the financial year before their takeover to \xc2\xa3104m in 2013-14 and building a new main stand at Anfield, in which half of the extra 8,500 seats will be reserved for corporate hospitality, is testament to FSG\xe2\x80\x99s plans for the club to live within its lucrative means. Buying or developing young players with rich potential is also fundamental to the strategy as FSG, three years into the process with Brendan Rodgers as manager, plays the long game to keep up with the Joneses at Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United.</p> <p>That strategy looks fundamentally flawed, however, when a player who Rodgers claims has the potential to be world class wants out at the age of 20.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s never been about money,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sterling in the interview with the BBC last month that generated the negative headlines he now supposedly feels Liverpool should have protected him from. \xe2\x80\x9cI talk about winning trophies throughout my career. That\xe2\x80\x99s all I talk about. I don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about how many cars I\xe2\x80\x99m going to drive, how many houses I\xe2\x80\x99ve got. I want to be the best I can be.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The finances involved in Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s contract saga are now well-documented. He has missed out on over \xc2\xa31m in wages by rejecting Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s offer of a new five-year deal worth \xc2\xa3100,000 a week and will wave goodbye to a further \xc2\xa33.38m should the impasse drag on until the summer of 2016, when he will have only 12 months remaining on his current \xc2\xa335,000-a-week contract. The advice received from representative Aidy Ward, plus the absence of a contract offer from Liverpool when Sterling was part of a title-challenging side last season, has been criticised extensively too.</p> <p>But take the England international at his word and his desire to leave represents a damning verdict on Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s prospects under FSG.</p> <p>Steven Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s Anfield farewell gave Liverpool opportunity to recognise loyalty and a heartfelt connection to the club, but also their fleeting presence in modern football. Players rarely play the long game and, as Sterling joined the lap of honour after Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s defeat by Crystal Palace, his daughter in his arms, it was in the knowledge Anfield will not be home to Gerrard or Champions League football next season. This failure to finish in the top four this term means Liverpool have qualified for the Champions League once in six seasons. The club have won one trophy \xe2\x80\x93 the League Cup \xe2\x80\x93 in nine years and are facing yet another crucial summer in the transfer market, plus the inevitable transitional problems that entails. Liverpool have the fifth highest turnover in the Premier League and are currently fifth in the Premier League table.</p> <p>Maybe there is some truth in Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s protestations he is not \xe2\x80\x9ca money-grabber\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 though he and Ward know Manchester City, one leading suitor, would be prepared to pay around \xc2\xa3150,000 a week \xe2\x80\x93 and glory is his primary motivation for wanting a move? If so, it exposes the risk in FSG\xe2\x80\x99s policy of building for a future and not the present.</p> <p>Gerrard and Rodgers are both on record as saying the club must sign proven talent this summer. It would represent a welcome departure in the eyes of supporters if Ian Ayre, Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive, confirmed that was the intention during the scheduled meeting with Sterling and Ward on Friday.</p>  <p> Related: The Fiver | It\xe2\x80\x99s. Just. The. Way. It. Works </p>   <p>The indications are it will come too late and that the winger has resolved to go, although his exit is by no means a formality. FSG proved during Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez\xe2\x80\x99s first attempt to leave Liverpool in 2013 that it will not be coerced into a transfer or sell a major talent to a Premier League rival.</p> <p>Not that Sterling is in Su\xc3\xa1rez\xe2\x80\x99s bracket in terms of ability or affection from Liverpool supporters. One factor in Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s dismal end to the season, failure to qualify for the Champions League or reach the FA Cup final, is the deterioration in the 20-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s form since controversy over his unsigned contract erupted. Liverpool held Su\xc3\xa1rez to his contract and were rewarded with a phenomenal season from the Uruguay international that almost yielded the league title.</p> <p>In contrast, criticism has got to Sterling, although he can legitimately cite the club\xe2\x80\x99s failures in the transfer market last summer as a reason he has performed a variety of roles, including becoming the focal point of Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s attack.</p> <p>His influence may have waned during the run-in but Sterling has started more games for Liverpool this season than any outfield player apart from Jordan Henderson. Only Gerrard has scored more goals for Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 team than his 11 (and having lost his two leading goalscorers from last season \xe2\x80\x93 Su\xc3\xa1rez and the injured Daniel Sturridge \xe2\x80\x93 the manager will not countenance a repeat this summer).</p> <p>Yet as he looks around the Liverpool dressing room and sees Mario Balotelli on a basic \xc2\xa380,000 a week, Glen Johnson on \xc2\xa3120,000 a week and even the likes of Fabio Borini earning far in excess of his \xc2\xa335,000 per week wage, Sterling, just like his employers in Boston, must also question the merits of financial fair play.</p>'
