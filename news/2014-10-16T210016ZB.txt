b'Brendon Batson urges Premier League \xe2\x80\x98bullies\xe2\x80\x99 to hire black managers'


b'<p>Brendon Batson has rejected Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s claims that managerial jobs are awarded purely on merit and called upon Richard Scudamore and the 20 Premier League chairmen to address racial discrimination in English football by coming up with an alternative to the Rooney Rule.</p> <p>Speaking on the day when a statue of Arthur Wharton, the world\xe2\x80\x99s first black professional footballer, was unveiled at St George\xe2\x80\x99s Park, Batson said that \xe2\x80\x9cexclusion\xe2\x80\x9d still existed in the English game when it came to coaching and managerial opportunities for black and ethnic minority [BME] candidates.</p> <p>The former West Bromwich Albion player described the Premier League as \xe2\x80\x9cthe bullies in the playground\xe2\x80\x9d and said that it was time for the Football Association, for whom he works as an adviser on equality, to take the lead by addressing underrepresentation in its development teams.</p> <p>In the past Scudamore has dismissed the Rooney Rule, which was introduced in the US in 2003 and compels NFL teams to interview at least one minority candidate for head coach and general manager jobs. \xe2\x80\x9cIf people are good enough, then they will get chances,\xe2\x80\x9d the Premier League chief executive said in 2011. Mourinho echoed those views this month. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no racism in football \xe2\x80\x93 if you are good, you get the job,\xe2\x80\x9d the Chelsea manager said.</p> <p>Responding to those comments, Batson, who became a pioneer for black footballers in England in the 1970s, said: \xe2\x80\x9cI say the numbers don\xe2\x80\x99t lie. A few years ago we had about six or seven, including [Jean] Tigana, [Ruud] Gullit, Keith Alexander, Leroy Rosenior, people like that. We have now got two [Chris Powell at Huddersfield and Keith Curle at Carlisle], so we are going south.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI have got no proof of racism whatsoever. But something is going on and I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s good enough to say: \xe2\x80\x98If you\xe2\x80\x99re good enough, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get there.\xe2\x80\x99 As black players, our talent could not be denied because it was out there, in your face. At the moment there is an exclusion; you can\xe2\x80\x99t even get an interview. You are not seeing the numbers.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Although he accepts that it may not be possible for the Rooney Rule to be applied in English football in exactly the same way as it works in the US, Batson said that the recruitment process needed to be overhauled to improve representation on interview shortlists. The desire and determination to bring about that change, Batson argued, should come from the people at the top of English football.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere is another model out there and we should learn from that. We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t just dismiss [the Rooney Rule] and go: \xe2\x80\x98It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t suit us.\xe2\x80\x99 Our [model] would be different. But I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what would be great, if Scudamore and his 20 chairmen got up and said: \xe2\x80\x98We need to do something different.\xe2\x80\x99 What that is I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting. But they need to do something different. They can\xe2\x80\x99t keep going the same way year in, year out, going: \xe2\x80\x98If you\xe2\x80\x99re good enough, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get there.\xe2\x80\x99 Because there are good people out there.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The issue is especially topical. Gordon Taylor, the Professional Footballers\xe2\x80\x99 Association chief executive, recently spoke of \xe2\x80\x9ca hidden racism which holds clubs back\xe2\x80\x9d when making appointments and the Football League is conducting a review into the underrepresentation of black, Asian and ethnic minorities in management and coaching. Batson believes there is a \xe2\x80\x9cmood\xe2\x80\x9d that needs to be seized upon. He described Wharton\xe2\x80\x99s statue as a catalyst for change and urged the FA to set the standard for others to follow.</p> <p>Referring to St George\xe2\x80\x99s Park, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got the 24 national teams here, the home of England\xe2\x80\x99s football teams, there are numerous employment opportunities, and the FA need to grasp that opportunity and show the Premier League and the Football League that positive action can bring positive results.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think the FA can lead on this. The Premier League are the bullies in the playground, we know that. But the FA have got a role to play and I think can take some real positive action with their development teams. Chris Ramsey is with the Under-17s at the moment. I think they need to be getting more people from BME to be more involved with their development teams, so they can see that visibility and that will send a really positive message out to the next generation of black players.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRaheem Sterling is 19 but your career is over in the blink of an eye. You want to put it in his head: \xe2\x80\x98Maybe I have got a future [in the game after playing].\xe2\x80\x99 You need positive imagery and positive messages.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
