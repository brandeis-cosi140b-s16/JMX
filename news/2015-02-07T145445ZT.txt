b'<p>That Harry Kane, huh? He\xe2\x80\x99s just helped Tottenham to leapfrog Arsenal, and make it to the top four! That was a fully deserved victory by Spurs, who were all over Arsenal during that second half. Arsenal, though not at their best, didn\xe2\x80\x99t even play particularly badly; they were simply blown away by the Spurs swarm, and by that man Harry Kane, who is some player all right. Champions League football - and a finish above Arsenal for the first time in a couple of decades - is a very real possibility now!</p>'
