b'Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 emerges from rut in win at Aston Villa'


b'<p>Some people believe Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 is overrated, which is fine. Everyone is allowed an opinion and even people who find Tour\xc3\xa9 underwhelming, with his crucial goals and inspirational performances for Manchester City, have the right to vote. It is not ideal but that is the price we pay for living in a democracy.</p> <p>Yet those who are firmly in Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s corner have been going through a crisis of confidence, much like the big man himself. A towering force in City\xe2\x80\x99s midfield on their way to winning the title last season, Tour\xc3\xa9 has endured a loss of form following problems off the pitch. First he suggested he wanted to leave City and then he had to deal with the death of his younger brother, Ibrahim, in June. Understandably that hit Tour\xc3\xa9 hard and, after a sluggish World Cup, he continued to struggle at the start of this campaign, his commitment and even his usefulness to City called into question.</p> <p>For long periods at Villa Park on Saturday, Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s malaise was showing no signs of going away. City were finding it difficult to break through Villa\xe2\x80\x99s massed defence and you could hear the knives being sharpened when Tour\xc3\xa9 twice knocked simple passes out of play in the first half. He was a picture of frustration, aghast at his failure to complete the most basic of tasks, and the thought must have crossed Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s mind that City would be better off without Tour\xc3\xa9.</p> <p>Pellegrini knew better. He knew Tour\xc3\xa9 has always had a knack of scoring important goals for City and so he found a way to bring out the best in him. Just after the hour, he introduced Fernando and Frank Lampard for Edin Dzeko and the hamstrung Fernandinho, switched to a three-man midfield and the reward came when a liberated Tour\xc3\xa9 broke Villa\xe2\x80\x99s resistance by firing home from 20 yards in the 82nd minute. It was his first goal in the league since May and six minutes later Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero rammed in a second to keep City within touching distance of Chelsea.</p> <p>The consensus afterwards was that Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s tactical alteration was behind Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s resurgence, although curiously the manager disagreed. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that was the reason,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9dI think he continued playing in the same way \xe2\x80\x93 one time with Fernandinho by his side and then with Fernando and Lampard. He always had the same freedom to make the movement to go inside the box. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that was a tactical change to allow Yaya to score.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe tried for 65 minutes. They had so many players inside the box it was very difficult for both strikers to have the ball. I think playing with Frank \xe2\x80\x93 who also has a lot of goals \xe2\x80\x93 behind the striker could change the problem they had the whole game. The last 25 minutes we must make the change, to change the way they defended.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini likes playing with two strikers and domestically his 4-4-2 system has brought City plenty of joy, yet the change to 4-3-3 worked and could be the solution in Europe. The exceptional David Silva became more influential, Lampard was a threat and Tour\xc3\xa9 had more protection. Tour\xc3\xa9 has not found it easy for City in the Champions League and was exposed against Bayern Munich and Roma.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI repeat that for me it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a tactical problem,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a lot of statistics on games when we play with two and how many we play with one. The most amount of games we win is with two strikers and four midfielders. We can make changes \xe2\x80\x93 it is important to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The hope for Pellegrini is that Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s goal against Villa is the boost he needed, although he insisted he has always had faith in him. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I speak with him every day I know what he thinks and know the way he works,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe was working in the perfect way. All of the players in the world can have better or worse moments. He always criticises himself on when he was going to return to his normal performance.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Man of the match David Silva (Manchester City)</p>'
