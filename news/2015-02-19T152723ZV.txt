b'<p>The black passenger prevented from getting on the Paris metro by Chelsea fans singing a racist chant has made a police complaint.</p> <p>The passenger, named by Le Parisien only as Souleymane S, told the paper he had not watched the footage published by the Guardian on Tuesday night because he lost his phone in the altercation with the Chelsea supporters. But, shown the video by Le Parisien, the 33-year-old married father of three said he would contact French anti-racism associations and go to the police. </p> <p>He had not told his family about the incident, he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat would I have said to my children? That daddy was pushed off the metro because he was black? That\xe2\x80\x99s pointless.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>A Frenchman of Mauritanian origin, Souleymane S was born in Paris and grew up in the Val-d\xe2\x80\x99Oise area outside the city. He works in a company near Richelieu-Drouot metro station where the incident happened on Tuesday night. He told Le Parisien: \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to get on to the carriage, but a group of English supporters blocked me and pushed me back. I tried to force a gap and get on. In the scrum, I lost my phone. </p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey were saying things to me in English but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really understand what they were saying. I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak a word of English.\xe2\x80\x9d </p>           Parisians shocked by racist Metro incident    <p>He added: \xe2\x80\x9cI understood they were Chelsea fans and made the link with the PSG match that night. I also understood very well that they were targeting me because of the colour of my skin.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, I live with racism; I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really surprised at what happened to me, even if it was the first time in the metro.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He said he \xe2\x80\x9cfaced them down for a long time\xe2\x80\x9d, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cAfterwards someone came and said to me that I\xe2\x80\x99d been brave to resist people like that. In my view, the incident lasted around six or seven minutes. After a while transport staff intervened, but only to ensure there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a fight. Their objective was to get the transport moving again.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNo passenger came to my defence, but in any case what could one have done? Then the train moved on and I waited for the next one.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Shown the video by Le Parisien, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know I was filmed. The fact that I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about it now gives me courage to go to the police and file a complaint ... These people, these English fans should be found, punished and locked up. What happened should not go unpunished.\xe2\x80\x9d </p>'
