b'Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s detractors at Arsenal showcase appetite for the sack race | Sean Ingle'


b'<p>Shortly before the final whistle at the Emirates on Saturday evening an Arsenal fan walked up to the press box with a sign that read \xe2\x80\x9cWenger Out\xe2\x80\x9d. It was one of the more measured reactions to the Manchester United defeat. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger has been a great manager; recently, though, he has needed to be a formidable stoic too. As abuse daggered from the stands \xe2\x80\x93 as it does with uncomfortable regularity nowadays \xe2\x80\x93 it was if he was wearing noise-cancelling headphones. Stubbornness, on occasion, has its merits.</p> <p>But try telling that to Arsenal fans. They have witnessed Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s scenes many times: a chilli pepper start neutralised by bland finishing; dominance transplanted into defeat because of a soft spine and a reckless inability to anticipate the counter. One friend reckons Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with supporters resembles a fantastic marriage gone bad. It is unlikely to lead to divorce \xe2\x80\x93 yet \xe2\x80\x93 but most managers are not so secure.</p> <p>So far this season 24 managers in English football\xe2\x80\x99s top four divisions have left their clubs, the most recent being Mansfield\xe2\x80\x99s Paul Cox last Thursday. Others, including Alan Pardew and Harry Redknapp, have clung on. Even Brendan Rodgers admitted after Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s defeat at Crystal Palace that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t safe. Next May is a way off but the record for the number of managers to depart in one season \xe2\x80\x93 64 in 2012-13 \xe2\x80\x93 could be under threat.</p> <p>Supporters appear more impatient these days. Clubs certainly are. Between 1974-75 and 1983-84 an average of 34 managers a season lost their job in the top four divisions of English football. From 1984-85 to 1993-94 that figure crept up to 37. From 1994-95 to 2003-04, it was 42. it has shot up to 53.</p> <p>In the early 90s, when Gazzetta Football Italia burst on to British screens, the rate at which Italian clubs went through managers before the Christmas panettone brought wry bemusement. But in the 2013-14 season 14 Premier League managers moved on \xe2\x80\x93 only one fewer than in Serie A.</p> <p>Spanish coaches, incidentally, still see England as a mecca of patience and tranquillity. The reality is somewhat different.</p> <p>So what has changed? The widening gap between the rich clubs \xe2\x80\x93 who win a higher percentage of matches than before \xe2\x80\x93 makes \xe2\x80\x9csuccess\xe2\x80\x9d harder for smaller teams. The voracious appetite of 24-hour news channels and social media, which turns blips into full-blown crises, plays a part too. Fans are also quicker to bellow their frustrations \xe2\x80\x93 with some justification. When it cost a couple of quid to stand on the terraces, defeat hurt emotionally \xe2\x80\x93 now it can rip a hole in the wallet as well as the heart.</p> <p>But there is something else too. Eeveryone \xe2\x80\x93 you, me, fans, clubs \xe2\x80\x93 probably expects too much from managers. There are few professions with such a high failure rate, as we cling to the hope that a change in the dugout will produce a miracle on the pitch. In most cases it does not happen.</p> <p>John Goddard, a professor of financial economics at Bangor Business School, has tracked every managerial spell in the top four divisions in English football since 1972-73 to the end of last season. That is 1,861 different spells, by 867 different managers. And how many of them won more games than they lost? Less than a third.</p> <p>A staggering 558 out of those 867 managers (64.4%) have lost more league games than they won; 28 (3.2%) have identical numbers of wins and losses. And only 281 managers over 41 years (32.4%) have a winning record.</p> <p>Yes, wins and losses are a crude measure. But at least they are a measure. Certainly one league club at the start of this season deeply analysed the spending and quality of each team in their division, before giving their manager a realistic points target to shoot for. Yet such an approach is rare.</p> <p>But all club chairmen and fans should be aware \xe2\x80\x93 as Chris Anderson and David Sally point out in the Numbers Game \xe2\x80\x93 there is correlation between wages and success, and expectations should be adjusted accordingly.</p> <p>Giovanni Trapattoni, meanwhile, reckons: \xe2\x80\x9cA good coach who gets everything right can make a team maybe 5% better and a bad one can make it 30% worse. Sometimes more\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 which puts things into perspective, even if Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho and Sir Alex Ferguson might take umbrage with it.</p> <p>As for Wenger, well, historically he remains one of the best. Only nine managerial spells in top flight English football since 1972-73 are better in terms of win ratio: Guus Hiddink, Mourinho (twice), Avram Grant and Carlo Ancelotti at Chelsea; Manuel Pellegrini and Roberto Mancini at Manchester City; Kenny Dalglish in his first spell at Liverpool; and, of course, Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United.</p> <p>Still, that seemed light years away on Saturday as Arsenal fans again weighed up how much past success and longevity \xe2\x80\x93 Wenger is closing in on 700 Premier League games \xe2\x80\x93 can act as mitigation for a manager who has bullheadedly spurned the chance to reinforce his defensive ramparts and central midfield and has made the worst start of his reign.</p> <p>The bookies, incidentally, reckoned Arsenal would end the season in third back in August. For all their recent woes, that still does not seem an unreasonable request.</p>'
