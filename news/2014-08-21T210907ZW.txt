b'Wales 0-4 England | Women\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup qualifier match report'


b'<p>Eight months after taking over as England\xe2\x80\x99s head coach, the Welshman Mark Sampson was effusive in his praise of players and staff alike after his team clinched their place in next year\xe2\x80\x99s Women\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup finals with a decisive win against his home nation at the Cardiff City Stadium.</p> <p>The victory was effectively wrapped up by the interval, the Birmingham City winger Karen Carney opening the scoring in the 16th minute and then three goals arriving in the last six minutes of the first half courtesy of the Chelsea striker Eniola Aluko, her club colleague Laura Bassett and the Boston Breakers striker Lianne Sanderson.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m delighted to have come here and produced that quality performance,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sampson, who took charge after the August dismissal of Hope Powell and after the caretaker Brent Hills had led the side to wins in the first four qualifiers.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHuge credit to the players, who\xe2\x80\x99ve produced another wonderful display. They\xe2\x80\x99ve been great since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in charge, as have the staff \xe2\x80\x93 they were in a difficult position when I came in, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve really rallied behind me. Credit to Brent too \xe2\x80\x93 he started the campaign with a 100% record so I was in a great position to take it on. It\xe2\x80\x99s been a huge team effort to get us into this position.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>While England\xe2\x80\x99s place is secured at the finals, to be staged in Canada next June, Wales still have the chance to qualify via a play-off if they win their last group game, away to Ukraine next month, to finish second in the group.</p> <p>To achieve that victory, however, they will have to show a vast improvement on this showing. The head coach, Jarmo Matikainen, said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a long, long time since I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen us so afraid. The first half was extremely disappointing.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe will take positives from the second half, when we came back into the game and played like we can. To get the result we need against Ukraine we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to show the bouncebackability we\xe2\x80\x99ve shown throughout the campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>On the same day next month that Wales are in Ukraine, England will end their campaign in Montenegro, aiming to stretch their 12-year unbeaten record in World Cup and European Championship qualifying to 42 games \xe2\x80\x93 32 of them under Powell and four led by Hills before Sampson took charge last December.</p>'
