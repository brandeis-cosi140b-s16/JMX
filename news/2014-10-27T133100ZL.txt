b'<p>Luke Shaw believes the 1-1 draw with Chelsea at Old Trafford is \xe2\x80\x9chuge result\xe2\x80\x9d for Manchester United, describing Chelsea as their toughest challenge of the season.</p> <p>Robin van Persie\xe2\x80\x99s equaliser in the fourth minute of added time answered Didier Drogba\xe2\x80\x99s strike to claim the point for United. Shaw said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a huge result for us when you look back at the game maybe we could have got more than one point but end of day never gave up showed that today but we know if we took our chances maybe it could have been three.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe know what Chelsea are about and when they went 1-0 up they didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose shape and they kept pressing. We found that hard at times but in the end we got that chance and we took it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Shaw said Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s team proved United\xe2\x80\x99s sternest challenge yet. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was our toughest test so far and we know what Jos\xc3\xa9 is like,\xe2\x80\x9d the left-back said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe drills his team into sort of a shape and that shape sometimes you cant break it down but I am happy with the goal at the end but we could have got more.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Shaw praised David De Gea\xe2\x80\x99s display. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you look at David\xe2\x80\x99s save just before their goal, it was a world-class stop and I think, in the past few weeks, with what he has been doing, it\xe2\x80\x99s amazing to see him come into form like this now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He also pointed out how Thibaut Cortois kept Chelsea in the match. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve seen what Courtois has done in the past six months, not just for Chelsea but before that [with Atl\xc3\xa9tico] so we know what his qualities are and he\xe2\x80\x99s proved to be a great buy for them. We had a lot of chances and, with him in goal, he helped them a lot. Robin had a few and I think it might have been Adnan [Januzaj] who had a shot as well. There were those chances but he\xe2\x80\x99s a world-class goalie and he helped them a lot.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Regarding how Old Trafford reacted when Van Persie\xe2\x80\x99s late goal \xe2\x80\x93 his third of the season \xe2\x80\x93 went in, Shaw added: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a feeling I\xe2\x80\x99ve never felt before. The whole crowd got up and you saw how much it meant to all of us. We all jumped on each other. It was crazy, the fans, the stadium sort of erupted. It was a great feeling and I was proud to be involved in that. We spoke in the dressing room and we knew we could have got three points with the chances we had and maybe we could have done a bit better on their goal. But that\xe2\x80\x99s football at the end of the day.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>After an injury hampered start to his United career the 19-year-old believes he is finally settling in. \xe2\x80\x9cDefinitely, it\xe2\x80\x99s always hard at the start but I felt really good,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt fit and strong so hopefully now I can get a run of games and keep improving and keep getting my fitness up.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
