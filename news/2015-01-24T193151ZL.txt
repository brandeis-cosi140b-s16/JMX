b'Liverpool 0-0 Bolton Wanderers: FA Cup \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>Post match musings: Bolton spent much of this match under the cosh, but their 6,000 travelling fans should be very proud of their team. It was a brave and disciplined defensive performance in which all of their players stepped up and their centre-backs and goalkeeper in particular were excellent. They rode their luck at times - Matt Mills should have been sent off and they could have conceded a penalty for a Spearing tug on Henderson - but who\xe2\x80\x99d begrudge them their good fortune on a day when so many plucky underdogs have prevailed against the big boys. That\xe2\x80\x99s your lot from me, enjoy the rest of your weekend. </p>     Some of the 6,000 Bolton fans, who are a happy bunch after leaving Anfield with a draw following a good performance by their team.
