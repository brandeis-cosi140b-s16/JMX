b'Crystal Palace v Manchester United: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s that! A tale of two goalkeepers, really. David De Gea was his usual magnificent self, the platform on which United built their victory. They\xe2\x80\x99d have lost without him. Julian Speroni, meanwhile, gifted United their winner. A sense that United have got away with one there, but they\xe2\x80\x99re remembering to do what the great Manchester United teams always did: turn average performances into victories. They\xe2\x80\x99re on the verge of Champions League qualification now. Over the entire piece this season, they\xe2\x80\x99ll deserve it. Palace were a shade unlucky today, though. Ah well, they\xe2\x80\x99ll always have December 1972.</p>'
