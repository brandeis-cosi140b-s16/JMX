b'The Fiver | It\xe2\x80\x99s a new day'


b'MAN NAMES TEAM <p>Arsenal and Liverpool both had a fairly eventful time of it in Big Cup last night. But whose antics were the most unbelievable? Arsenal shipped three goals at home in the last 29 minutes of their match, a collapse which almost certainly locks them into their usual pattern of finishing second in the group, drawing Bayern Munich, then losing 4-0 away from home in the first leg. Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers, meanwhile, selected 11 professional footballers to play a professional football match, which they did fairly competently, albeit without reward. Yes, he really did do that!</p> <p>But it\xe2\x80\x99s a new day, and while a vindicated Rodgers is presumably ringing around every MLS club to see if anyone fancies taking a knackered 34-year-old midfielder off his hands, Chelsea manager Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho will tonight be taking a much less cavalier approach away at Maribor. He\xe2\x80\x99s giving the Slovenians his full respect, despite what happened at Stamford Bridge a fortnight ago. \xe2\x80\x9cThe 6-0 win is a fake situation,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI need to convince the players that the game at Stamford Bridge was one of these matches where everything goes in our direction. Normally Chelsea to score goals needs a lot of chances.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s almost as though he stubbornly prefers grinding out dour victories to offering the masses free-flowing entertainment, something you\xe2\x80\x99d never have guessed from following his career.</p> <p>Meanwhile former Chelsea charge Frank Lampard, bound for MLS but currently in quarantine at Manchester City, has announced that he could come back from injury to face CSKA Moscow tonight. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not far off selection,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cFingers crossed, if all goes well, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back in contention.\xe2\x80\x9d City don\xe2\x80\x99t need to beat CSKA to retain hopes of making it to the knockout stages, except they sort of do if we\xe2\x80\x99re all being honest with ourselves and each other. Whether Lampard will still be around should they eventually progress is another matter. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m contracted here until the end of December and my future will be at New York City at some stage,\xe2\x80\x9d was the furthest he would be drawn on the issue. And fair enough. City being City, the Fiver suggests there\xe2\x80\x99s no point anyone worrying about this quite yet.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Paul Doyle from 7.45pm GMT for MBM coverage of Manchester City 2-2 CSKA Moscow, while Scott Murray will be on hand for Maribor 0-1 Chelsea.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAmong other investigations were [those] launched into attempted manslaughter, disturbing the peace, breaking laws regulating explosives and laws on assembly\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 a quiet night for German police after Galatasaray fans threw firecrackers and smoke bombs on the pitch and at Borussia Dortmund fans.</p>     A quiet night.

Unfortunately it fulfils the very meaningful end of maintaining financial status quo, since qualifying for Big Cup is the Big Payout that most managers strive for \xe2\x80\x93 even are tasked with as their main objective \xe2\x80\x93 and it is deluded to think that managers who can\xe2\x80\x99t even plan beyond one season with confidence actually care about things like \xe2\x80\x98glory\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98building a legacy\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98fans\xe2\x80\x99. It is with sadness that I say that whatever deluded reality the Fiver currently occupies, I would like to live in it also\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 John O\xe2\x80\x99Brien.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou talk of the futility of prioritising the Premier League ahead of Big Cup and the vicious circle that it entails. Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s been working for Arsenal these last 17 years\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Dave Hill.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to thank Chris Harrison for pointing us to the teaspoon-disappearance study (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters). One of the elegant scientific conclusions of said study was that \xe2\x80\x98somewhere in the cosmos, a planet must be entirely given over to spoon life-forms. Unattended spoons make their way to this planet\xe2\x80\x99. It\xe2\x80\x99s good to see that the Fiver editor practices science in his spare time\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Rigel Barros.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver contained the unconscionable blunder \xe2\x80\x98only three squares of Andrex to share between them\xe2\x80\x99. This is just a red rag to the herd of pedantic bulls, right? Fine, I\xe2\x80\x99m charging like an aforementioned half-tonne of bovine \xe2\x80\x93 Andrex, and indeed all types of toilet tissue come in rectangles, and of course this is clearly due to the greater surface area provided by rectangles. So glad I could clean that up for you. Wait? What?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Gerry Wall (and no other toilet tissue pedants).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

Such was the demand, eh?</p> <p>Oh look, it\xe2\x80\x99s former Brazil striker Adriano. Yay! Oh look, he\xe2\x80\x99s been charged over alleged links to a notorious Rio drug lord. Ah. \xe2\x80\x9cThe accused, freely and consciously, in collaborating in the trafficking of drugs, associated with active traffickers in the Vila Cruzeiro [favela] with the intention of facilitating the illicit trafficking of drugs and related activities,\xe2\x80\x9d read a court statement.</p> <p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger isn\xe2\x80\x99t a happy chappy after Arsenal blew a 3-0 lead at home to Anderlecht in Big Cup. \xe2\x80\x9cAcross the pitch defensively, we were very, very poor,\xe2\x80\x9d he sniffed.</p> <p>Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal isn\xe2\x80\x99t planning to strengthen his squad in January.

Uh-oh. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s funny, that one\xe2\x80\x99s funny, he\xe2\x80\x99s giving me a bit of stick, that\xe2\x80\x99s funny, he\xe2\x80\x99s giving me stick, he\xe2\x80\x99s coming back on again! I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna shut him down\xe2\x80\x99. Invariably I get it right, and I shut him down and he gets retweeted and he has to open a new account because he gets destroyed,\xe2\x80\x9d he bantzed.</p> <p>Genclerbirligi striker Deniz Naki is leaving the club after an alleged racist attack. \xe2\x80\x9cThey threatened me that this was the first warning, the club did not need anyone like me and I should go away,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis time I could defend myself \xe2\x80\x93 it was only fists \xe2\x80\x93 but eventually it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a knife. I no longer feel safe there.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Fabio Cannavaro will replace Marcello Lippi in charge of Chinese champions Guangzhou Evergrande next season. \xe2\x80\x9cChinese Super League champions Guangzhou Evergrande officially unveiled Fabio Cannavaro as their new coach,\xe2\x80\x9d tweeted Cannavaro in a spectacular piece of third-personning.</p> <p>And notoriously calm Millwall boss Ian Holloway has got the funk on with the lack of video technology after a 2-2 draw with Blackeye Rovers. \xe2\x80\x9cUefa, Fifa, we are sick of mistakes,\xe2\x80\x9d he fumed. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got the cameras at all these grounds \xe2\x80\x93 Premier League, Championship. It\xe2\x80\x99s human error, the eyes aren\xe2\x80\x99t quicker than the ball. There is so much on this, just get the fourth official in the stand and get the decisions right with a camera \xe2\x80\xa6 What\xe2\x80\x99s happening to football at the moment cannot, cannot, cannot be right.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> RECOMMENDED VIEWING <p>Are Napoli currently the most dangerous side in Italy?
