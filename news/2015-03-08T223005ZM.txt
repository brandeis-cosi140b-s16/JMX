b'Monday FA Cup replay for Bradford and Reading leaves both managers annoyed'


b'<p>Snobbery takes many forms. One of its more subtle manifestations is the way in which a certain type of football fan places European football on a pedestal while adopting a slightly patronising attitude to most domestic competition.</p> <p>This is a tribe whose horror of \xe2\x80\x9cparochialism\xe2\x80\x9d is so pronounced they wear their frequent inability to place famous English football grounds such as Valley Parade on blank maps of Britain almost as badges of honour.</p> <p>As subscribers to the view that even the most tedious Champions League group game automatically trumps the FA Cup, they will doubtless be a little puzzled by Steve Clarke\xe2\x80\x99s outburst.</p> <p>Reading\xe2\x80\x99s manager is upset about the Uefa rule that decrees domestic cup ties cannot be played on the same nights as continental fixtures and he has a persuasive argument.</p> <p>A European midweek fixture list featuring Monaco against Arsenal and Manchester City at Barcelona next Tuesday and Wednesday respectively, dictates Bradford City and Reading must replay this quarter-final a week next Monday night.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think the Football Association are devaluing their competition a little bit by making both teams play on Saturday, then Monday,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarke, whose side have a tough Championship trip to Watford 48 hours before the rematch while Bradford are in League One action on the same afternoon when they travel to Notts County.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t we just replay on the Tuesday or the Wednesday \xe2\x80\x93 what are Uefa going to do?\xe2\x80\x9d added Reading\xe2\x80\x99s manager. \xe2\x80\x9cI love the FA Cup and everything it stands for. Bradford\xe2\x80\x99s run to this point has been amazing and all that romance is there but the FA choose to make both teams play on a Monday. That\xe2\x80\x99s the one disappointment.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>If the chances of the FA standing up to Uefa seem considerably slimmer than either of these sides giantkilling their way to Wembley, the replay promises to be much more intriguing than Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to redeem themselves in Monaco.</p> <p>It is certainly hard to imagine the atmosphere at Stade Louis II on 17 March matching that at Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s unseasonably warm and sunny Valley Parade, where a crowd in excess of 24,000 willed Phil Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s players to consign Reading to the same fate as Chelsea and Sunderland.</p> <p>Although 4,500 fans had travelled north from Berkshire they were largely drowned out by the hugely vociferous claret-and-amber clad majority at one of England\xe2\x80\x99s most evocative arenas.</p> <p>If there would be something fitting about Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s team reaching the final in the month that marks the 30th anniversary of the Bradford fire disaster, only the bravest of gamblers would stake much on predicting the eventual semi-finalist.</p> <p>While Pavel Pogrebnyak and Oliver Norwood grazed the woodwork for Reading, Gary Liddle also hit a post for Bradford, who enjoyed the better of a second half featuring Alex Pearce, Clarke\xe2\x80\x99s captain, stripping down to his underpants after an accidental, 87th-minute collision with Fran\xc3\xa7ois Zoko left him with a broken nose, Pearce declined to retreat to the touchline. While one physiotherapist straightened the nose, another removed the blood that had cascaded out of it by hosing down the near naked defender with bottled water.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been easy for Alex to go off the pitch,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarke said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut his attitude was wipe the blood away, straighten the nose and get on with it \xe2\x80\x93 he\xe2\x80\x99s a proper centre-half.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pearce\xe2\x80\x99s demeanour was entirely in keeping with the occasion. If quality was a little lacking at times \xe2\x80\x93 combined with a playing surface poor enough to shame some parks teams, Clarke\xe2\x80\x99s decision to field an extra man in midfield stifled Bradford\xe2\x80\x99s customary scope for creative manoeuvre \xe2\x80\x93 the spirit in which the game was played could hardly have been bettered anywhere.</p> <p>At times the challenges were not so much clattering as positively wince inducing but there was no complaining to the referee, no faking of injuries, no pretending to have been insulted and no time-wasting. In short there was none of the petulant posturing that all too often blemishes even the very best European fixtures.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a physical, evenly matched game with no quarter asked, no quarter given and both teams just looking for that lucky bounce of the ball,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarke said. His Bradford counterpart did not demur. \xe2\x80\x9cBoth teams put in real honest performances,\xe2\x80\x9dParkinson said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere were some tremendous challenges. You have to praise the honesty of both sets of players.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>A little later the home manager could be found sipping beer from the bottle while chatting with a small group of Bradford fans in a passage off the main stand. The sense of unity seemed thoroughly emblematic of an unfailingly friendly club that had gone to the bother of baking trays of cakes decorated with mini claret-and-amber scarves for the media.</p> <p>It is the sort of ambience that bolstered Bradford\xe2\x80\x99s run to the 2013 League Cup final and explained why Parkinson was disappointed not to have proceeded directly to the team\xe2\x80\x99s first FA Cup semi-final since 1911.</p> <p>Even so, part of him will relish a return to a former habitat where he remains a cult hero. Acknowledged as one of Reading\xe2\x80\x99s best central midfielders of all time, Bradford\xe2\x80\x99s manager can expect a particularly warm reception. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll enjoy going back,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough when I went down to watch them against Wigan their pitch was almost as bad as ours.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>By then he had already challenged the replay\xe2\x80\x99s timing. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I learnt it would be on a Monday I questioned it,\xe2\x80\x9d Parkinson said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was told it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98the rules\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 but it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not ideal.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Man of the match Stephen Darby (Bradford City)</p>'
