b'<p>It is five and a half years since Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s last great European night at Anfield. And what a night. A 4-0 victory over the most-decorated club on the continent, two goals from the club captain Steven Gerrard on his 100th appearance in Europe and a display of goalkeeping from Iker Casillas of such breathtaking brilliance that it prevented Real from a defeat that could quite easily have been double the final score. But there was a peculiar feel to events, too. Maybe it was the shock of witnessing a Real Madrid team who were still well in the running for the Spanish league title play so badly. Or perhaps it was just the way the game played out, with Juande Ramos\xe2\x80\x99s team showing so little fight in a ferocious mauling by a Rafael Ben\xc3\xadtez side not known for cutting loose when protecting an aggregate lead would do.</p> <p>When Jay Spearing robbed Lassana Diarra of possession and swept a delicious cross-field pass to Dirk Kuyt to set up an attack in the second half, it was as bizarre as it was heartwarming. Spearing\xe2\x80\x99s name rang out around the Kop as loud as any other Liverpool player\xe2\x80\x99s in recent history. Here was a scrawny 20-year-old local lad who used to play at centre-back coming on to replace the irrepressible Gerrard against Real Madrid and upping the tempo in midfield. Fantastic. But weird. Yes, definitely weird.</p> <p>The memory of him bossing an already dazed and confused Fernando Gago and Diarra in the middle, mixing grace with aggression in a heady 20-minute cameo, is strong. Changing fortunes and the passage of time have a funny way of skewing perspective, though. Spearing\xe2\x80\x99s appearance \xe2\x80\x93 and the fourth goal scored by the much-maligned Andrea Dossena to complete Real\xe2\x80\x99s humiliation \xe2\x80\x93 now seem like a freakish end to a highly successful spell in Europe for Liverpool, not the precursor to further success that many fans assumed it would be.</p>     Steven Gerrard and Fernando Torres celebrate after the Liverpool captain\xe2\x80\x99s penalty gave the home side a 3-0 aggregate lead.    <p>Fernando Torres, at the height of his powers, stuck the knife into Real early on, taking advantage of some slipshod defending from Pepe (after a Jamie Carragher punt that belonged on Walton Hall Park not the top table of European football) to bundle the ball to Kuyt, before darting into the box to get one over the team he grew up hating. And then there was Gerrard, who was near-unstoppable, scoring a nerveless penalty and a half-volley to cap a wonderful team goal in a display that had Casillas dashing from his goal to shake his hand before Spearing replaced him after 70 minutes. The dominance of Xabi Alonso and Javier Mascherano in midfield was most notable though, their silk and steel again proving the perfect platform upon which a famous European win could be built. Real had Fabio Cannavaro and Raul fighting against the fading of the light. Liverpool had many players at or approaching their peak. Timing is everything. And Liverpool were playing Real at the right time. Just.</p> <p>On Wednesday night the fixture will be replayed and one expects fans to recall the last with mixed feelings. As joyous as the victory was for Liverpool it proved to be nothing more than an entertaining passage in a story that would ultimately go nowhere (Liverpool were knocked out by Chelsea in the quarter-finals). The scoreline pointed to a false future for both clubs. As Liverpool fans revelled in the knowledge that they had claimed another big European scalp not previously taken on home turf the Real fans, sat disconsolately in the Anfield Road end, perhaps felt that the chill wind that had blown them off course could lead to the club getting lost in the wilderness.</p> <p>But a year later it was Liverpool who were out in the cold and rapidly losing their way. They were no longer in the Champions League and heading for a miserable seventh-place Premier League finish that would signal the end for Ben\xc3\xadtez and put Liverpool on the rocky road towards appointing Roy Hodgson. Meanwhile, the owners, Tom Hicks and George Gillet, had been outed as a couple of cowboys and protests against their ramshackle running of the club had become a regular occurrence.</p> <p>In Madrid, Real could count Alonso and Cristiano Ronaldo among their ranks as the returning president Florentino P\xc3\xa9rez wasted no time in reprising the gal\xc3\xa1ctico model in a bid to steer the club towards future jubilation, not humiliation, in Europe.</p>     Andrea Dossena celebrates scoring the fourth goal for Liverpool to complete a 5-0 aggregate win on a balmy night.    <p>As Real\xe2\x80\x99s star-studded squad turn up at Anfield for the first time since their infamous humbling, the two players who did most to colour Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s famous win as one of the club\xe2\x80\x99s most extraordinary, are facing uncertain futures. Spearing is battling to pull troubled Bolton out of the mire in the Championship, and Dossena \xe2\x80\x93 who followed his heroics at Anfield in 2009 by doing the same again in Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s 4-1 win at Old Trafford four days later \xe2\x80\x93 is kicking his heels looking for a club.</p> <p>Form suggests Liverpool will not have the luxury of being able to make such unlikely heroes of supporting cast members this time around. Whatever the scoreline, it will do well to match the outlandish events of 10 March 2009.</p>'
