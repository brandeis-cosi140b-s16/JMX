b'Football transfer rumours: Mario Su\xc3\xa1rez to Arsenal?'


b'<p>Fizzle, crackle, crackle, fizzle, crackle, crackle \xe2\x80\xa6 Whizz! Bang! There\xe2\x80\x99s only one way to celebrate Happy New Transfer Window Day* reader \xe2\x80\xa6 and that\xe2\x80\x99s by strapping a Jim White effigy to a rocket and sending him hurtling deep into January 2015. Boom! The Rumour Mill\xe2\x80\x99s had a few you see. But, don\xe2\x80\x99t mess with fireworks kids. Or booze. Or Jim White. It won\xe2\x80\x99t end well. </p> <p>Speaking of things not ending well, Arsenal are in for Su\xc3\xa1rez again. Only this time it is Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s Mario Su\xc3\xa1rez. A defensive midfielder. Yes, really. And the money on the table is not going to be \xc2\xa340m+\xc2\xa31. No, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be much, much cheaper. Because he\xe2\x80\x99s just OK. He\xe2\x80\x99ll do a job. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. </p> <p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger will have space in his squad for an average player if Lukas Podolski manages to jump the moat full of crocodiles surrounding the Emirates and shuffle off to Internazionale. </p> <p>Oh, and it says here that Yaya Sanogo is going to Aston Villa. How\xe2\x80\x99s that hangover feel now Villa fans? Ouch.</p> <p>Harry Redknapp is sniffing around for a striker. Harry Redknapp has been sniffing around for a striker since 1983. The QPR manager is not sniffing around for Peter Crouch though. No, the man doing that is Tony Pulis. Who else? Expect a couple of million quid to cover the costs of transporting Target Man down the M6 from Stoke to West Brom. </p> <p>Brendan Rodgers has ruled out making any more signings in January. Well, Roma\xe2\x80\x99s Radja Nainggolan and Bayern Munich\xe2\x80\x99s Xerdan Shaqiri have made the decision for him after telling Liverpool to do one. And no, Divock Origi doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count. They already own him. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Mario Balotelli is off to Napoli if you believe some words written in an Italian newspaper. And MLS suits have got all hot and bothered after Rodgers said he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stand in the way of Steven Gerrard if he wanted to say ta-ra to Anfield. The suit that is most hot and bothered is the New York Red Bulls one. That suit\xe2\x80\x99s got a Thierry Henry-shaped hole to fill and Gerrard is just about the size and weight to fill it. </p>  <p> Related: Manchester United consider Aston Villa\xe2\x80\x99s Ron Vlaar for potential transfer </p>   <p>Little light on rumours this morning eh? Hmmm. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like much is happening. Bang! </p> <p>What was that you ask? That was the sound of Thorgan Hazard being shot out of an airbomb to Borussia M\xc3\xb6nchengladbach from Chelsea in a deal worth \xc2\xa36.3m. Yes, \xc2\xa36.3m. Despite never having done a tap for Chelsea. That\xe2\x80\x99s branding for you. Happy New Year.</p> <p>*OK, so it actually opens on 3 January but let\xe2\x80\x99s not split hairs. It\xe2\x80\x99s a new year.</p> <p></p>'
