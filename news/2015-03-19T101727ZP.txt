b'Premier League clubs\xe2\x80\x99 Champions League failings look a trend not a blip | Owen Gibson'


b'<p>There was a period during that heady spell of Premier League domination in Europe in the middle of the last decade when top-flight grounds would reverberate to a familiar chant. \xe2\x80\x9cChampions League, we\xe2\x80\x99re having a laugh,\xe2\x80\x9d it ran. \xe2\x80\x9cChampions League, we\xe2\x80\x99re having a laugh.\xe2\x80\x9d These days, not so much. Giddiness has long since been replaced by grumbling, punctuated by bouts of soul-searching and blood-letting.</p> <p>Around the time the unfortunate James Milner was being dumped on his backside by a nutmeg from the imperious Lionel Messi on Wednesday, it was tempting to consider it an apt metaphor for the performance of English clubs at the hands of their continental rivals this season.</p> <p>Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s exit against Barcelona made this just the second season since 1995-96 \xe2\x80\x93 those far off days when David Batty and Graeme Le Saux scrapped on a freezing pitch in Moscow \xe2\x80\x93 in which no English club reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League, while Everton\xe2\x80\x99s defeat to Dynamo Kyiv in the Europa League on Thursday night meant this is the first season since 1992/3 that the Premier League will have no representative in the quarter-finals of any European competition. More worrying, perhaps, is the fact the other occasion when no British clubs graced the last eight was in 2013. Once in three years looks like a blip, twice begins to feel like a trend.</p> <p>Since 2011-12 there have been 11 Champions League quarter-finalists from La Liga, six from the Bundesliga, five from Ligue 1 and three each from Serie A and the Premier League. Just as success in Europe started to become taken for granted during the period that peaked in 2008 and 2009 when six of the eight semi-finalists were from the English top flight, so the manner of failure has quickly become familiar.</p> <p>Where once the rampaging physicality of the modern, moneyed Premier League threatened to sweep all before it, now it looks pass\xc3\xa9. Each of the four sides to go out of the competition at times looked outthought, outpassed and even outmuscled.</p>       <p>It is no coincidence the end of English clubs\xe2\x80\x99 dominance coincided with the beginning of the purple patch of Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s imperial phase but watching them pepper the impeccable Joe Hart on Wednesday, it seemed barely credible there was a Premier League club in seven out of eight Champions League finals between 2005 and 2012. Oddly, there also seems to be a hangover from winning the Premier League title. The champions have failed to get beyond the quarter-finals in each of the last six seasons.</p> <p>For Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s Manchester City, defeat in the Camp Nou ushered in a new bout of speculation over his position and intensified the curious feeling of ambiguity about the competition among fans that has accompanied their return to Europe in the Sheikh Mansour era. They have yet to reach a quarter-final, for all the millions spent.</p> <p>For Arsenal, desperately familiar failings were also in evidence as heroic second-leg failure against an average Monaco side was not enough to claw back the damage caused by the tactical ineptitude on show at the Emirates. They went out at the last-16 stage for the fifth year running. Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s return to the European top table was virtually over before it began, mired as they were in the darkest days of their post-Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez hangover. At Stamford Bridge, Chelsea departed enveloped in a controversy and self-righteous fury but undone by an undercooked performance against Paris Saint-Germain, who played more like a Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho team than Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s team.</p> <p>In each case, there are micro issues. It is possible to identify turning points in each of those ties, twists of fate that might defy sweeping generalisation. If Chelsea had closed the game out after fortuitously finding themselves 2-1 up in extra time. If Olivier Giroud had converted at the end in Monaco to put Arsenal three goals up. But that does not mean the macro themes are not worth considering. Some tropes have been trotted out since a home draw for Chelsea in their second leg made it likely no English team would make it through.</p> <p>Some have wondered whether the lack of a winter break is a factor, as they do whenever England fall down at a major championship, but that did not stop Premier League sides enjoying that period of dominance from 2005 onwards.</p> <p>PSG had played just one game fewer than Chelsea this season when they lined up at Stamford Bridge. Winter break or no, Messi had played more games than any of the City players he tormented on Wednesday. Others wonder whether the frenzy of games in the Premier League is a problem, with two keenly fought domestic cup competitions to play for as well as European competition. But Chelsea had enjoyed an 11-day break before their second-leg match.</p>  <p> Related: Lionel Messi returns to his breathtaking best in Barcelona victory | Sid Lowe </p>   <p>What is undeniable is that there is a paradox at the heart of the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s money-spinning success. Just a month after unveiling a record-breaking \xc2\xa35.1bn domestic TV deal, the league is left without a representative in Europe\xe2\x80\x99s premier club competition. The very things that have driven relentless growth in television income and the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s popularity around the world \xe2\x80\x93 intense competition, every game a real contest, the emphasis on speed over thought \xe2\x80\x93 have had arguably a negative impact when it comes to Europe. While the number of games may be comparable in leagues across Europe, their intensity is not.</p> <p>There is also an economic factor. The relatively equitable distribution of television revenues between the 20 clubs has over time resulted in a competition where, on their day, one team can beat any other. And there is a tactical one too. Taken together, it is hard to avoid the conclusion English clubs, for whatever reasons, are finding it hard to adapt from the helter-skelter league programme, where every Sunday is Super, to the sometimes more cerebral demands of Europe.</p> <p>It is a theme Mourinho took up before 10-man PSG defeated Chelsea. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s more difficult for English clubs,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis league is very difficult and the Champions League is a completely different situation. To imagine English football, the best league in the world, without one single team in the Champions League quarter-final is hard.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In the season that Chelsea played Manchester United in an all-Premier League final, the top four finished 11 points clear of fifth-placed Everton. The gap from top to bottom was 76 points (albeit skewed by a woeful showing from Derby County). During that period of English dominance, the debate was about whether the top four or five were pulling away from the rest to an extent that was becoming embarrassing.</p> <p>No longer. Premier League clubs barely have time to pause for breath, let alone prepare properly for the switch to the competing demands of European matches. Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle, the former Chelsea winger now with Wolfsburg, was just the latest to this week suggest players in England are able to do little but recover between matches for much of the season.</p> <p>Some say the prospect of a period of unceasing Premier League dominance was a factor in Uefa\xe2\x80\x99s Michel Platini deciding to usher in the financial fair play era to rein them in. Since then, it might also be argued the financial dominance enjoyed by Barcelona and Real Madrid in Spain and Bayern Munich in Germany has enabled them to hoover up the very best talent.</p>  <p> Related: Give us a break over winter demands on English clubs | Sean Ingle </p>   <p>Practical help will be hard to come by. Premier League insiders insist there is little wriggle room in a packed fixture calendar to allow for more preparation time, although the odd Friday night fixture from 2016-17 may in theory aid clubs with a European date the following week.</p> <p>The BT Sport executives who shelled out \xc2\xa3897m for exclusive Champions League rights from next season should not be the only ones nervously analysing the trend data. In time it may have implications for everything from the Uefa coefficient that determines the number of Premier League qualifiers for Europe\xe2\x80\x99s elite club competition to their ability to continue to increase exponentially their commercial and broadcasting revenues from overseas.</p> <p>Yet for all the statistical and anecdotal evidence on offer, it is perhaps dangerous to read too much into the latest Premier League meltdown. Sport is cyclical and this wheel may turn again. But for now, despite swimming in a sea of broadcasting cash, the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s strutting big names are not waving but drowning.</p>'
