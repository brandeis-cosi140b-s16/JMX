b'Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Diego Costa: I\xe2\x80\x99m no angel but didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to be banned'


b'<p>Diego Costa has denied he deliberately stamped on Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Emre Can in the Capital One Cup semi-final but admitted: \xe2\x80\x9cI am no angel.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Chelsea striker was banned for three games for treading on Can\xe2\x80\x99s ankle in the second leg, a decision that enraged Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho and his club. The Brazilian-born Spaniard, who contested the FA\xe2\x80\x99s retrospective charge, was suspended for the leaders\xe2\x80\x99 game on Saturday against Manchester City which ended 1-1.</p>  <p> Related: Chelsea 1-1 Manchester City | Premier League match report </p>   <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as what happened on Tuesday, the main thing is when I get home I can go home and I can go to sleep knowing that I\xe2\x80\x99ve not done anything wrong, because I never meant to do that and it was not on purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d Costa told the Sunday Telegraph.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you can clearly see that on the video. But it is a suspension. I have to accept that, I have to take it. Obviously I feel sad because I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be able to help the team, to play. But I have to accept it and respect it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Costa has built a reputation for a no-holds-barred attitude on the pitch and he said the ban would not alter how he played.</p>  <p> Related: Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho facing Premier League punishment after press blackout </p>   <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not saying I\xe2\x80\x99m an angel. I\xe2\x80\x99m no angel. You can see that. But every time I play I will play the same way because that\xe2\x80\x99s the way I am. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I need to do in order to support my family.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOn the pitch I will always be like that. That\xe2\x80\x99s my character and I will always compete and compete \xe2\x80\x93 always. I\xe2\x80\x99m a different guy off the pitch, as you can see, but on the pitch I will not change.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9dOn the pitch I transform myself, I really, really want to win,\xe2\x80\x9d Costa said.</p> <p>Mourinho failed to fulfil his media duties after the draw with City in the wake of his \xc2\xa325,000 fine by the FA for alleging there is a \xe2\x80\x9ccampaign\xe2\x80\x9d against Chelsea and Costa\xe2\x80\x99s ban.</p>'
