b'Branislav Ivanovic in clear but Chelsea and Everton charged by FA'


b'<p>Branislav Ivanovic has been spared a Football Association charge following his alleged headbutt on Everton\xe2\x80\x99s James McCarthy on Wednesday night but there remains anger at Chelsea over how they feel their player was tried by the media.</p> <p>The Chelsea manager, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho, believes there is a \xe2\x80\x9ccampaign\xe2\x80\x9d against his club and this latest flashpoint has done nothing to disabuse him of the notion.</p> <p>He and other members of staff at Chelsea were disappointed at Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s post-match comments, in which the Everton manager said that Ivanovic\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbehaviour is wrong\xe2\x80\x9d and that he deserved to be sent off. \xe2\x80\x9cHe grabs him around the neck in a forceful manner, then puts his head against him when James McCarthy didn\xe2\x80\x99t react,\xe2\x80\x9d Mart\xc3\xadnez said.</p> <p>Chelsea have also been furious at the Sky Sports News coverage of the incident, alleging that it has been one-sided. They were unhappy, for example, that the channel did not dwell on their contention that McCarthy had stepped on Ivanovic\xe2\x80\x99s foot, just before he leaned in towards the Everton player.</p> <p>They have also questioned Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that McCarthy was an entirely innocent party, when he had run over to enter the melee which followed the second yellow card for Everton\xe2\x80\x99s Gareth Barry. The FA has charged both clubs with failing to control their players \xe2\x80\x93 they have until 6pm on 17 February to respond. Chelsea are upset at the charge.</p> <p>Everton believe that the pictures speak for themselves and McCarthy was the victim of a headbutt by Ivanovic in a game that they lost 1-0 to Willian\xe2\x80\x99s last-minute goal. But an FA panel disagreed after the matter was referred to them on Thursday when the referee, Jon Moss, admitted that he had not seen the incident. Ivanovic, for his part, has maintained that he did not butt McCarthy.</p> <p>The panel studied footage of the clash from every available angle and they concluded that it was not sufficient to have merited a red card. Consequently, Ivanovic has avoided further action.</p> <p>The FA has brought 54 successful retrospective charges for Premier League players since 2004-05, when its system for dealing with incidents that were unseen at the time by match officials was introduced. Arsenal, Manchester City and Newcastle United have had the most, with six apiece, while Chelsea have had four.</p> <p>, Diego Costa was the most recent, for his stamp on Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Emre Can last month \xe2\x80\x93 which has fired Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s current complex \xe2\x80\x93 while Ramires was brought to book last season for an elbow on Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s Sebastian Larsson. Ivanovic was punished in 2011-12 following an off-the-ball clash with Wigan Athletic\xe2\x80\x99s Shaun Maloney and Didier Drogba was sanctioned in 2008-09 for throwing a coin back at Burnley supporters.</p> <p>The FA only brings retrospective charges when it sees the offence as being clear-cut. It reviews many hundreds of cases \xe2\x80\x93 such as this latest one with Ivanovic \xe2\x80\x93 in which it deems charges to be inappropriate.</p>'
