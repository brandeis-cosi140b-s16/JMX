Transgressors ultimately face the possibility of transfer bans or having players excluded from the Champions League.</p>   <p>Fifa inactivity allows menace of third-party ownership to go unchecked</p> <p>With typical insouciance, Sepp Blatter did not hesitate before tossing another unmet promise on to the tottering pile he has amassed down his scandal-hit years as Fifa president. Faced with mounting concern over third-party ownership of players in the wake of the Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano affair in England and growing evidence of its pernicious influence, he did not pause before vowing to ban it outright.</p>   <p>Chelsea stake in third-party ownership leaves Premier League on shaky ground</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThird-party ownership\xe2\x80\x9d of players sounds a creepy and disturbing enough practice before any details are illuminated. English football, along with that in France, Poland, and, perhaps surprisingly, Colombia, has been a TPO-free haven while investors have seeped endemically into player ownership elsewhere, particularly in Portugal and Spain. It is sad to see Portugal\xe2\x80\x99s legendary clubs, Benfica, Sporting Lisbon and Porto, so hocking their players, yet finding TPO no real answer to financial struggle \xe2\x80\x93 exporting dozens of players in the modern era has made the intermediary, the super agent Jorge Mendes, dazzlingly rich, but the clubs are still frayed. </p> '
