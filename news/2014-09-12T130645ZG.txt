b'Garry Monk wants Swansea to remember troubles as spur to success'


b'<p>They could not have scripted it any better \xe2\x80\x93 and in more ways than one. Swansea City take on Chelsea on Saturday at Stamford Bridge less than 24 hours after the red carpet was rolled out at the Empire cinema in Leicester Square for the premiere of Jack to a King, the documentary that tells the remarkable story of the Welsh club\xe2\x80\x99s 10-year journey from the brink of extinction to promotion to the Premier League.</p> <p>It is quite a double header in the bright lights of London for a club that was sold for \xc2\xa31 in 2001 and stood 90 minutes away from relegation to the Conference two years later. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s probably the perfect time for the film,\xe2\x80\x9d Garry Monk, the Swansea manager, says, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Chelsea game just fits in with the story because it\xe2\x80\x99s one you would not believe unless you witnessed it. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why I want people to watch the film \xe2\x80\x93 it gives you a big insight.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Jack to a King is an uplifting and inspirational tale. On the eve of the Chelsea fixture, it provided Monk \xe2\x80\x93 who has been named manager of the month for August after leading Swansea to three straight league victories, including a 2-1 win at Old Trafford on the opening day \xe2\x80\x93 with a good excuse to travel back in time and reminisce on just how far the club has come.</p> <p>Sitting in one of the suites at the Liberty Stadium, the man who has captained Swansea in every division rolled back the years as he recalled the days when players changed in their cars, training sessions took place on council pitches that resembled a \xe2\x80\x9ccow field\xe2\x80\x9d and, more recently, the embarrassment he felt when Scott Sinclair signed from Chelsea and he had to show the winger the \xe2\x80\x9ccold and dingy\xe2\x80\x9d room where the kit was kept. \xe2\x80\x9cHe looked at me as if I was joking,\xe2\x80\x9d Monk says.</p> <p>Fiercely proud of Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s history, Monk wants all the players in his squad to be in tune with the Jack to a King storyline, in which fans and local businessmen explain how they came together to keep their club alive, rattling coin buckets outside the old Vetch Field and, in some cases, remortgaging houses, before their incredible rise through the divisions.</p> <p>At the same time, Monk is conscious of the importance of looking forward as well as back. Mocked up as Harry Potter and named as one of four \xe2\x80\x9cnew wizards\xe2\x80\x9d managing in European football on the front of Gazzetta dello Sport\xe2\x80\x99s extra-time supplement this week, Monk has challenged his players to create more history.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf we stop now we have wasted all that hard work,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe good thing is I understand everything we have been through. That makes me more responsible to ensure we do keep pushing forward. There is expectation now. I understand what we are. People say the Chelsea game is a top-of-the-table clash but we are not going to be title contenders at the end of the season. We know exactly what we are but we are a club looking to progress.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe are never going to be a financial power in this league but we can make sure we are competitive. Survival has to come first \xe2\x80\x93 we always have to get to that magic mark of 40 points \xe2\x80\x93 but we experienced Europe last season and that was something we really enjoyed and we would like to get back to at some point. We have shown we can win a cup, but we would like to do it [qualify for Europe] through the league as well. I am not saying that is our target for this season. What I am saying is, it is a goal we could have for the future.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Monk is not getting carried away by Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s impressive start to the season but there is much to admire about the way that his team are playing, in particular the attacking trio behind Wilfried Bony. Wayne Routledge and Nathan Dyer, who was unfortunate to miss out on an England call-up for the Norway and Switzerland games, have caught the eye on the flanks while Gylfi Sigurdsson has revelled in between them, scoring once and playing a part in four other Premier League goals.</p> <p>While the club\xe2\x80\x99s wider playing philosophy has not changed, statistics underline the impression Swansea under Monk are much more incisive than they were during Michael Laudrup\xe2\x80\x99s reign. There is less possession \xe2\x80\x93 despite playing two of their three league games at home, Swansea are ranked eighth in that category this season \xe2\x80\x93 and more penetration, with a much lower pass-to-shot ratio giving them a cutting edge often missing before. Only Chelsea have had more efforts on target than Swansea this season.</p> <p>Underpinning everything is the strong work ethic Monk has instilled in and around the club\xe2\x80\x99s new training ground. The players already know that on Tuesday next week they are in for a double session \xe2\x80\x93 something that would have been unheard of under the previous regime \xe2\x80\x93 and there is no excuse for not being up to speed with their own performances or upcoming Premier League opponents when all of that information is available on the iPads they were issued with in the summer.</p> <p>All of which feels light years away from some of the early scenes in Jack to a King, when Swansea were at the wrong end of the fourth tier, begging and borrowing to survive.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of clubs who went up and through the leagues \xe2\x80\x93 we did it ourselves before \xe2\x80\x93 but the actual circumstances the club found itself in and what people had to go through will leave people surprised,\xe2\x80\x9d Monk says. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople will enjoy the film even if you are not a football fan.\xe2\x80\x9d What chance a sequel?</p>'
