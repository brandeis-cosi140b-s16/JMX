b'Brendan Rodgers: more pain to come for \xe2\x80\x98unrecognisable\xe2\x80\x99 Liverpool'


b'<p>Brendan Rodgers has laid bare his frustration with Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s form by describing the team as unrecognisable from last season\xe2\x80\x99s title challengers and warning supporters there could be further pain ahead.</p> <p>Liverpool host West Bromwich Albion in the Premier League on Saturday with seven points from six league games and having fallen to a fourth defeat in nine matches this term at Basel in the Champions League. Rodgers claimed \xe2\x80\x9cwe have gone into a little bit of transition\xe2\x80\x9d following the Basel setback and compared Albion\xe2\x80\x99s visit to his first league game as Liverpool manager at The Hawthorns in August 2012, on the basis that \xe2\x80\x9cthis feels like a new group again\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>While a transitional period was to be expected following Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez\xe2\x80\x99s departure to Barcelona and the signing of nine players at Anfield this summer, the extent of Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s problems have alarmed even their manager. Rodgers made no attempt to camouflage his team\xe2\x80\x99s malaise ahead of the Albion game and, in his most damning assessment of Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s performances so far this season, admitted he does not recognise the side that fell just short of winning the Premier League title only six months ago.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard for the supporters [to hear of transition] and I understand that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Liverpool manager. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must be so difficult at the moment to see a team that for 18 months has been so fluent and dynamic. Now they probably look and see a team with maybe no resemblance to that in many ways. I understand that and there is no one more frustrated than myself.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe look at our game, which is based a lot on possession, but we\xe2\x80\x99re also a big threat in transition when we\xe2\x80\x99ve won the ball back and we\xe2\x80\x99re on the break. We don\xe2\x80\x99t look a threat on the break at the moment. You could argue that we don\xe2\x80\x99t even play in transition. We\xe2\x80\x99re getting no one in behind. No one is breaking lines.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>That final complaint, about a lack of penetrating runs behind opposition defences, suggests Rodgers has more concerns over Mario Balotelli\xe2\x80\x99s contribution than the lack of goals and assists that he criticised on Thursday. The \xc2\xa316m signing from Milan is likely to lead the line again against Alan Irvine\xe2\x80\x99s team with Daniel Sturridge expected to miss a seventh game with a thigh injury, another source of frustration for the manager.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOur team dynamic was dominating the game with the ball but also without the ball,\xe2\x80\x9d added Rodgers. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd without the ball means running and getting in behind people. We\xe2\x80\x99ve done that for 18 months. We did it at Tottenham. Once we lost that movement and speed of Sturridge \xe2\x80\x93 and the link-up of other people within that \xe2\x80\x93 that has broken the dynamic a little bit for us.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe just have to persevere until I get the squad back, until we have Emre Can back, Joe Allen, Daniel and the others. Then I think we will return to that level. In the meantime it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously been hard for the supporters and I totally understand that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Rodgers is confident Sturridge, Allen and Can will be fit after the forthcoming international break, for an intensive programme that includes back-to-back Champions League fixtures against holders Real Madrid. Until the team dynamic returns, however, the manager believes Liverpool will continue to face short-term problems. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to go through some pain along the way and right now we are in a difficult moment,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I think the pain is for now, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Liverpool manager also disputes that he should have followed Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s transfer policy this summer and acquired more established talent, albeit fewer in number. He said: \xe2\x80\x9cChelsea obviously brought in a seasoned professional in terms of the Premier League in F\xc3\xa0bregas. He\xe2\x80\x99s a very good player. And then Costa, who is someone we looked at a couple of years back as well, his profile suits the Premier League.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9c We lost a top class player and then had to bring in other players to help us now and for the future. Once these players settle in and adapt and really understand how we work I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll move back to where we were. There will be frustration now absolutely. No one respects that more than me. We have to work hard to get them settled and bedded in.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
