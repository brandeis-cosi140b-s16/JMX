b'Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez and Mesut \xc3\x96zil combine to develop Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s evolution'


b'<p>It was not quite as simple as a straight choice between Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas and Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez \xe2\x80\x93 the curiously shady inferences that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger dangles about F\xc3\xa0bregas\xe2\x80\x99s move to Chelsea do a fine job of obfuscating matters. But in the Arsenal manager\xe2\x80\x99s mind, the situation last summer became crystal clear.</p>  <p> Related: Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger wants to show Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho the way to go next season | Paul Wilson </p>   <p>With around \xc2\xa335m reserved for a marquee signing, Wenger prioritised logic over sentiment. He could not afford two of the talents Barcelona were seeking to offload from their collection and S\xc3\xa1nchez offered a dynamic Arsenal did not possess. In theory, they already had their F\xc3\xa0bregas-type in Mesut \xc3\x96zil, even if it required a substantial show of faith for Wenger to express that after an inhibited first season.</p> <p>That decision is starting to bear fruit. It is reasonable to wonder if Chelsea might have garnered fewer points this season without the precision passing of F\xc3\xa0bregas. But as far as Wenger is concerned, the evolution of his team has taken a positive turn with the connection that has grown recently between S\xc3\xa1nchez and \xc3\x96zil. It has been a key component of Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s recent sequence of nine Premier League wins and a run to the FA Cup final.</p> <p>Before F\xc3\xa0bregas\xe2\x80\x99s first return to the Emirates, Wenger declares himself \xe2\x80\x9cextremely happy\xe2\x80\x9d with the selection of S\xc3\xa1nchez to upgrade his team\xe2\x80\x99s attacking zest. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you want when you invest so much money is getting paid back on that front,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wenger. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I bought S\xc3\xa1nchez I thought he can play on the right, on the left, through the middle. First, that was an important quality. Second, I wanted someone who has a fighting spirit in the Premier League. That was needed \xe2\x80\x93 someone to say: \xe2\x80\x98Come on, I\xe2\x80\x99m ready for a fight.\xe2\x80\x99 Third, a guy with a good combination of running in behind who can dribble as well. On all of that, I was not disappointed.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>With 22 goals and 11 assists, S\xc3\xa1nchez has been both brilliant and efficient.</p> <p>After a mid-season dip (by his energetic standards) his increased levels have coincided with \xc3\x96zil enjoying his best spell in an Arsenal shirt. The developing rapport between Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s two record signings is notable. They connected for both goals in the FA Cup semi-final last Saturday, as S\xc3\xa1nchez burst on to passes from \xc3\x96zil. It took a few months for them to properly gel. \xc3\x96zil suffered from post-World Cup fatigue and a three-month injury leading up to January, and S\xc3\xa1nchez had his driest spell in front of goal in the few weeks that followed.</p>  <p> Related: Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Olivier Giroud has grown into an animal for Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger </p>   <p>But Wenger is very encouraged by the understanding they are generating \xe2\x80\x93 for next season as much as this. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople questioned Ozil,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wenger. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the first part of the season \xc3\x96zil wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there. In the second part of the season \xc3\x96zil has blossomed and is getting to where you want him to be. He is a player that is the centre of our game and also makes other people play. The real players are those who take the qualities of their partners \xe2\x80\x93 \xc3\x96zil is one like that. He is naturally generous.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>That was always a trait that embroiders F\xc3\xa0bregas\xe2\x80\x99s game, and Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s patience in \xc3\x96zil\xe2\x80\x99s ability to express himself for Arsenal is being repaid. His slow-burning season has warmed up considerably. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have to spend \xc2\xa335m to \xc2\xa340m for a position where you already have players, you have to question what is the logic,\xe2\x80\x9d Wenger said. Although he was also quick to namecheck Jack Wilshere and Aaron Ramsey for that attacking midfield role to back up his decision not to pursue a reunion with F\xc3\xa0bregas, the main man in that position is clearly \xc3\x96zil now.</p> <p>With Chelsea notoriously tricky to break down of late, Wenger is hoping the click in Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s attack can make the difference.</p>'
