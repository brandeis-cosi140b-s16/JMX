b'Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Cahill says beating QPR can put pressure on Manchester City'


b'<p>Gary Cahill wants Chelsea to pile the pressure on Manchester City before Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s Manchester derby by stretching their lead over the champions at the top of the Premier League to nine points with a victory over Queens Park Rangers at Stamford Bridge on Saturday.</p> <p>After drawing 1-1 at Manchester United when Robin van Persie\xe2\x80\x99s late equaliser denied Chelsea all three points, Cahill warned against complacency with regard to their west London rivals but the England defender is keen for Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side to focus on victory.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI thought we played well against United. Obviously there was disappointment at the end but it\xe2\x80\x99s another home game and one to look forward to,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cQPR are off the back of a good result [beating Aston Villa 2-0]. I watched them on Monday and they were great. We have a chance to get the right result and hopefully sit back and enjoy Sunday but it\xe2\x80\x99s never easy. You have to prepare right, rest up and make sure we\xe2\x80\x99re ready.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Didier Drogba has scored three times in his last three games and, with Mourinho hopeful that Diego Costa can be available again following hamstring problems, Cahill admits the Ivorian is providing healthy competition.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe is fully fit now, looking sharp and dangerous, exactly like he was when he went [in 2012]. He was massive for us [against Shrewsbury Town in the Capital One Cup] and he got a vital goal. There are options, not just up front but all over the pitch,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, before assessing Tuesday evening\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 win at the League Two side.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe have turned up, with some fresh legs and some of the lads who played [on Sunday] and we knew it was going to be a tough game but we grafted and showed character and got the right result in the end.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
