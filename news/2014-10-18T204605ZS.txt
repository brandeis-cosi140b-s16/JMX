b'Saturday Sundae: \xe2\x80\x98Dirty\xe2\x80\x99 money, dodgy TVs and a logic-defying own goal'


b'MAN OF THE DAY <p>Can anyone doubt that Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero is the best striker in the Premier League? Apart from anything else, he now has nine goals in six league games against Spurs. They are truly sick of the sight of him.</p> GOAL OF THE DAY <p>Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas continued his brilliant start in a Chelsea shirt with some delicious one-twos, combined with a neat finish to score the decisive goal against Crystal Palace.</p> OWN GOAL OF THE DAY <p>Or of the decade, perhaps. Santiago Vergini\xe2\x80\x99s effort wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just a rocket finish, but fell firmly into the \xe2\x80\x9cWhat were you even trying to do?\xe2\x80\x9d category. Magnificent. Incredibly, Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s afternoon at Southampton did somehow get worse.</p> STAT OF THE DAY <p>In their 6-0 defeat at Bayern, Werder Bremen became the first side not to have a single shot on goal in 6,495 Bundesliga games since records began in 1993-94.</p> FALSE START OF THE DAY <p>Not only was Newcastle v Leicester delayed by a suspect giant screen, but Chiek Tiot\xc3\xa9 was injured in the warm-up.</p> WELCOME OF THE DAY <p>Crystal Palace fans greeted Chelsea with a banner reading: \xe2\x80\x9cRoman\xe2\x80\x99s dirty money is a disease that has plagued our game\xe2\x80\x9d. Roman\xe2\x80\x99s money won.</p> MOST ARCH QUOTE <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think he will be back in perfect condition in mid-November to play for the national team\xe2\x80\x9d - Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho reacts to Diego Costa\xe2\x80\x99s injury problems.</p> HYDE WATCH <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the 3rd hat-trick scored against us in 3 games. Oh,\xe2\x80\x9d read a tweet from the beleaguered club. They lost 3-1 to Boston.</p>'
