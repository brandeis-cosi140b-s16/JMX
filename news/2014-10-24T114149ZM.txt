b'Mark Warburton\xe2\x80\x99s hard graft paying off after trading job in City for Brentford'


b'<p>Brentford celebrated their 125th anniversary this week but all the talk at Griffin Park is of the future. It has always been thus for Mark Warburton, the former city trader turned cosmopolitan coach who exchanged the banks for the Bees, driven by a burning ambition that is in fitting with his surroundings.</p> <p>Brentford will soon be playing in a new 20,000-seat stadium, backed by an owner who has already injected more than \xc2\xa340m, and with a squad still buoyed by the momentum from a promotion campaign. This is the west-London club\xe2\x80\x99s first season in the second tier for 21 years. If they stay in the division, it will be the first time they have done so since the early 1950s.</p> <p>So far, so good for Warburton. His side are 12th in the Championship going into Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s match at Bolton. There is, though, a bigger picture etched on the 52-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s mind. It has been 10 years since he left a lucrative career in finance but, since making a decision his wife described as \xe2\x80\x9cmad\xe2\x80\x9d, Warburton has packed in an awful lot.</p> <p>There was the peripatetic year spent visiting Europe\xe2\x80\x99s elite clubs, the innovative establishment of the NextGen youth series \xe2\x80\x93 which Warburton co-founded \xe2\x80\x93 the successful spell coaching at Watford, the role as Brentford sporting director, and the promotion from League One as manager.</p> <p>His whirlwind decade has calmed a little. On a fine autumn afternoon at the club\xe2\x80\x99s training ground, Warburton is refreshingly at ease. David Weir, his assistant manager, sits in the staff office while outside his two children kick a ball around during the half-term break. Lee Carsley joins the coaching setup days later. Thoughts are turning to a midweek game against Sheffield Wednesday but, for a short while, there is time for reflection.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to achieve something in football,\xe2\x80\x9d Warburton says. \xe2\x80\x9cI gave myself 10 years, I wanted to achieve something. I took a 90% pay cut but I certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t want it to come across as a sob story. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been really lucky. Now, here, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a real project. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go as high as we can, as hard as we can.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It is an ethos shared by the Brentford owner, Matthew Benham, whose relationship with Warburton goes back to their days in the city. In July, Benham became the majority shareholder of Danish Superliga side Midtjylland but it is the decision to replace Uwe R\xc3\xb6sler with Warburton in December 2013 that has reaped the biggest dividends.</p> <p>R\xc3\xb6sler had certainly laid the foundations for promotion before he left for Wigan and Brentford were cruelly denied an automatic step up to the Championship under the German in 2013, before falling in the play-offs. Warburton, though, has built on the experience garnered when travelling through Europe, making a seamless transition from the directors\xe2\x80\x99 box to the dugout.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt allowed me to make contacts and get my philosophy across,\xe2\x80\x9d he says of his education, visiting top clubs and establishing the NextGen tournament for promising talent. \xe2\x80\x9cI went to Sporting Lisbon, to Inter, to Ajax, Willem II, Valencia, to Manchester City, to Liverpool and you could speak to them for hours. What always emerged were discussions about players who were 17 and 18, when the first team is still too far away, especially at clubs of that stature. But for most, the under-19 and under-21 football was no challenge to them.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEnglish teams were playing each other four times a year in the academies, but suddenly Man City were playing Barcelona, Chelsea were playing Ajax, Inter Milan were playing Celtic. It was different and the clubs embraced it. The authorities never got it, that it was all about building relationships. How this was never taken over by our authorities, I\xe2\x80\x99ll never know.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>NextGen was suspended in August last year because of a lack of funding. Uefa has since established its own Youth League but only for clubs whose first teams play in the Champions League. Aston Villa, who won the NextGen series, had no opportunity to defend their title. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s so many flaws with the model and it\xe2\x80\x99s shameful that our project wasn\xe2\x80\x99t expanded,\xe2\x80\x9d Warburton says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe void still exists. It\xe2\x80\x99s scandalous in my eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Brentford were one of many clubs who benefited from the tournament. They signed Adam Forshaw from Everton, now with R\xc3\xb6sler at Wigan. Alex Pritchard, on loan from Tottenham Hotspur, has played in every league game this season on the back of impressing Warburton through NextGen. Betinho, on loan from Sporting, was part of their team who finished third in the 2012-13 tournament, although he has yet to make a significant impact.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI took David Weir over to Barcelona recently and they welcomed us in,\xe2\x80\x9d Warburton says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first-team manager, scouts, [Andr\xc3\xa9s] Iniesta and Xavi were all there, and they welcomed us in because of that relationship we had. I understand a lot of debate is required but if you want to see an improvement in youth development, if you want to fill that void between 18, 19, 20, 21, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do something. Our boys have got to be challenged against players of that level. Not academy kids who they have played against for 10 years.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of the Football Association\xe2\x80\x99s new proposals to improve the English game, put forward by the former Brentford chairman Greg Dyke, Warburton is pleased that at least a serious discussion has begun, even if the idea of Premier League B teams was roundly shunned.</p> <p>He says: \xe2\x80\x9cThe academies in England do a fantastic job, we produce some of the most gifted technical players in Europe, no doubt, but we have a void. The kids in Barcelona will go and play in Barcelona B. Dyke started the debate and said we need B teams, everyone shouted him down. But Bar\xc3\xa7a do it, at 17 in the NextGen the next step for those players was Bar\xc3\xa7a B, professional, in the Segunda.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMeanwhile, the English boys are playing under-21 football at a training ground at 11am. What are we doing? Friendly games don\xe2\x80\x99t do it. People shouted Greg Dyke down, at least he started the debate.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Warburton, who began his playing days at Leicester City and spent four years in non-league with Enfield, embarked on a career in finance that led him to North Carolina and Chicago. Now he is settled once again in Potters Bar with his wife, daughter and son, the latter playing in a development match for the Bees against Birmingham City this week.</p> <p>His life at Brentford is a far cry from the 14-hour working days in the city. However, Warburton believes the football and finance industries have much in common. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you look at the debt levels of some clubs \xe2\x80\x93 is it any different to some of the banks? Who would have said in 2005 Lehman Brothers would disappear. It went from the biggest company to nothing but it happened,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPeople say these clubs won\xe2\x80\x99t go under but look at the debt levels. I\xe2\x80\x99m watching teams in the Championship and looking at some of the benches \xe2\x80\x93 they\xe2\x80\x99ve got guys who are double and treble our highest-paid player here.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhat has stood me in really good stead is that being a trader was like football. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got 20 blokes round a desk, testosterone flying around everywhere, it\xe2\x80\x99s highly competitive, rewards, egos, you lose your job if you\xe2\x80\x99re not doing well, teamwork, contacts. It\xe2\x80\x99s a football world.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
