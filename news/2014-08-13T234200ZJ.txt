b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho predicts new Chelsea squad can dominate Premier League'


b'<p>After filling the role of the \xe2\x80\x9clittle horse\xe2\x80\x9d in last season\xe2\x80\x99s title race, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho is predicting that his new-look Chelsea squad are finally ready to dominate English football once again having secured most of his main transfer targets this summer.</p> <p>Since finishing third behind Manchester City and Liverpool last season two club stalwarts, Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole, have joined the Brazil defender David Luiz in leaving Stamford Bridge, while Chelsea have spent more than \xc2\xa375m on Cesc F\xc3\xa1bregas, Diego Costa and Filipe Lu\xc3\xads and also brought Didier Drogba back to London for a second spell. Now Mourinho believes he has everything he needs to mount a serious challenge on all fronts.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe have the squad that we want to have,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a squad for tomorrow, for next season and also a squad with big possibilities for the next five or 10 years with so many young people. So I like my squad very much.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI love the club because the club was fantastic and gave me the three targets I was asking for, in the left-back, a midfield player and a striker. In fact they gave me two strikers because Didier is also back.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe have bought three people in Filipe, Diego and F\xc3\xa1bregas, all in the best stage for a football player \xe2\x80\x93 between 25 and 30. They are three experienced players with the quality to strengthen immediately our team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea begin their new campaign on Monday night with a trip to newly promoted Burnley. Three losses to Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and Sunderland \xe2\x80\x93 who put paid to Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s record of 77 Premier League home games without defeat \xe2\x80\x93 virtually ended their hopes of regaining the league title in the Portuguese\xe2\x80\x99s first season back at Stamford Bridge.</p> <p>However, the manager has warned that his players have learned from that experience and expects them to make amends this time.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe squad improves, for sure, and the team can show qualities on the pitch that in the past we didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut obviously this is the Premier League and every team tries to be better, especially at the top. Are we ready for that? Yes, we are but this is England.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn other countries the title race is between two teams and sometimes only one. Here it is between five or six.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Everton have confirmed the signing of Ghana winger Christian Atsu on a season-long loan from Chelsea.</p>'
