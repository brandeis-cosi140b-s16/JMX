b'JOSE MOURINHO AND QUANTUM PHYSICS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn a very simple way, everything depends on space and time.\xe2\x80\x9d Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has a point. People in white coats looking through microscopes and telescopes and any other scope they can lay their hands on have nailed down the fact that everything does indeed depend on space and time, right back to the first 10\xe2\x80\x9337 seconds \xe2\x80\x93 or 0.0000000000000000000000000000000000001 seconds if you prefer \xe2\x80\x93 of the universe, before which nobody knows what was going on (wrote the Fiver risking the wrath of 1,057 maths notation pedants. And quantum physics pedants. And creationist pedants). But, ignoring that small exception, yes, Mourinho is spot on. Everything depends on space and time.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have matches with space and time it\xe2\x80\x99s much easier to play football,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Chelsea manager ahead of his club\xe2\x80\x99s season opener against newly promoted Burnley tonight. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you don\xe2\x80\x99t have space and time because a lot of football is based around tactics and systems: in a very simple way, everything depends on space and time. And when you don\xe2\x80\x99t have space and time to play, you need more quality.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>A trio of new signings will be given a chance to prove their quality at Turf Moor this evening, with Felipe Luis, Cesc F\xc3\xa1bregas and Diego Costa all expected to start. Who will start in goal, though, is a mystery. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is my first-choice today might not be my first-choice tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho riddled before adding: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat gets wetter and wetter the more it dries?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGive me food, and I will live; give me water, and I will die. What am I?\xe2\x80\x9d then skipping off over a rainbow.</p> <p>Those in the know expect Belgian man-octopus Thibaut Courtois to be given the nod over Petr Cech, with Cech\xe2\x80\x99s name then being pencilled onto shopping lists around Europe. He won\xe2\x80\x99t be on Sean Dyche\xe2\x80\x99s shopping list, though, with the Burnley manager constrained by budgets tighter than a spandex tourniquet. But the man they call the Ginger Mourinho \xe2\x80\x93 and hopefully tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game will bring an end to that epithet: there is the minor issue that they are utterly dissimilar in appearance, demeanour and personality \xe2\x80\x93 remains philosophical.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLook at what you\xe2\x80\x99ve got, not what you\xe2\x80\x99ve haven\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d zenned Dyche, strumming a lute, gesturing at the trees and stroking a whale. \xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t got that, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no point moaning about it, it just isn\xe2\x80\x99t there. We have to focus on what we\xe2\x80\x99ve got and use it wisely, and add to it accordingly when we can.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Dyche will be hoping Turf Moor proves an archetypal Difficult Place To Go. One thing is for certain: it won\xe2\x80\x99t be an easy evening for Chelsea.</p> <p>Join Nick Ames on Big Website tonight for a Fiver-baiting Burnley 0-5 Chelsea from 7.30pm.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY 1 <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI am very much relieved to have stopped doing football in Ghana. It has taken the pressure off my finances. On every match day, referees come to my hotel asking for money in order to officiate my matches fairly\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Tony Yeboah walks out on lower league football in Ghana after claiming referees have been attempting to use him as a cashpoint.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY 2 <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe did not have a third jersey with Ayew\xe2\x80\x99s number and the two jerseys already used by him were stained with blood and so he could not play with them\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Marseille explain that, after a head wound that would not close up, the reason Andre Ayew was subbed was not because of a concussion risk but because they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find a shirt that he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t bled all over. Not that it stopped them from unsuccessfully trying to convert a No33 shirt.</p> RANDOM DUTCH PROTEST AGAINST TECHNOLOGY OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cF**k Wi-Fi, support the team\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 PSV fans show they clearly aren\xe2\x80\x99t fussed about having the data-capability to play Angry Birds at the match. Coming soon, Ajax supporters rail against the Eredivisie website\xe2\x80\x99s keyword ordering system.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel. Subscribe today! And there\xe2\x80\x99s also a new app for iOS and Android \xe2\x80\x93 details of the football offering are here.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cCongratulations to Shane Long for miss of the season already, only one game into the new season. Oh, hold on, Torres might come on for Chelsea tonight \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Noble Francis.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI see the Fiver is way ahead of boffins at Harvard University in the race to develop a collective artificial intelligence. The Harvard engineers are over the moon at having created a hive mind comprising 1,024 simple robots collaborating without human control, where, \xe2\x80\x98at some level, you no longer even see the individuals; you just see the collective as an entity to itself\xe2\x80\x99. Something the Fiver managed to perfect with 1,057 simple robots years ago\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Dermot McDermott.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think Steve Hibbert (Friday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters) is himself missing a trick. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a drone-mounted laser defining a 10-yard cone around the free-kick-taker, you can do a lot better than \xe2\x80\x98anyone encroaching would be lit up by the beam\xe2\x80\x99. How about: anyone encroaching will have the offending part sliced off by the beam? (You\xe2\x80\x99d need to turn the laser up a bit, of course.) This technology might also help in \xe2\x80\x98dissuading\xe2\x80\x99 those players who persist in surrounding and badgering the referee when he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to make a decision\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Mo Holkar.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI always thought that your Guardian Soulmates ad placement was a tad optimistic, but Marten Allen\xe2\x80\x99s letter on Friday proves what we\xe2\x80\x99ve all long thought was unthinkable: reading the Fiver really can help you meet girls. Wow\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Justin Kavanagh.</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And if you\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing better to do you can also tweet the Fiver. Today\xe2\x80\x99s winner of our prizeless letter o\xe2\x80\x99the day is: Dermot McDermott.</p> JOIN GUARDIAN SOULMATES <p>Chances are that if you\xe2\x80\x99re reading this tea-timely football email, you\xe2\x80\x99re almost certainly single.

A GPS dot flashing on a screen in Stamford Bridge locates him at Vitesse Arnhem, where he\xe2\x80\x99ll remain till next summer.</p> <p>Bastia have decided not to punish Brandao for breaking Thiago Motta\xe2\x80\x99s nose in a cowardly butt-and-run incident after PSG\xe2\x80\x99s 2-0 win in Ligue 1. \xe2\x80\x9c[Bastia] condemns without any ambiguity the gesture of its forward\xe2\x80\x9d said a club suit. \xe2\x80\x9c[Bastia] also deplores the equally unacceptable behaviour of certain players who don\xe2\x80\x99t stop insulting and provoking their opponents,\xe2\x80\x9d said the same club suit, locating that missing ambiguity.</p> <p>Lack-of-ambition sirens have sounded in the HQs of various Pope\xe2\x80\x99s O\xe2\x80\x99Rangers fans\xe2\x80\x99 groups after reports that Newcastle owner Mike Ashley was perhaps moving closer to owning their club as well as Newcastle.</p> <p>Fiorentina head coach Vincenzo Montella has stuck a pair of metaphorical shackles on his jet-heeled winger Juan Cuadrado. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been here in the past, he is here now and he will be here in the future,\xe2\x80\x9d he growled in the direction of Ed Woodward.</p> <p>And Lincoln boss Gary Simpson has revealed that he used jelly babies to set out his formation when his tactics board was left on the bus. \xe2\x80\x9cI will do whatever is necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d cheered Simpson, whose tasty 4-2-4 overwhelmed Barnet in their 2-1 Conference win.</p> STILL WANT MORE? <p>Jamie Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s head is sore from all the headscratching as he pondered this: Arturo Vidal ticks all of Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s boxes, so why is Louis van Gaal not bothered about signing him?</p> <p>There was the unfamiliar sound of no booing at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park on Sunday. Why? Because Newcastle have got things right, on and off the pitch, reckons Louise Taylor.</p> <p>Bangers, belters, dinks, chips, punts and more. It\xe2\x80\x99s the best goals of the week.
