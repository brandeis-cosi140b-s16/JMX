b'Dick Advocaat focused on Palace amid calls to extend Sunderland stay'


b'<p>Dick Advocaat has won only one game \xe2\x80\x93 out of two \xe2\x80\x93 since succeeding Gus Poyet at Sunderland but, with that victory coming against Newcastle United, it is no surprise there is already a clamour to keep the Dutchman at the Stadium of Light beyond the end of his two-month contract.</p> <p>Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s hierarchy have made their intention to recruit a new coach this summer plain but Advocaat knows possession is nine tenths of the law and seems rather pleased supporters have begun lobbying for a contract extension.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not being arrogant but this is a normal situation for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the much travelled 67-year-old former Holland manager, whose side host Crystal Palace on Satuday. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the clubs I have worked at and with the prizes I have won it is normal for the fans to think that way about me.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe will wait and see with my situation but it\xe2\x80\x99s good to be back in club management. I\xe2\x80\x99m enjoying every minute of this. I enjoyed last Sunday, the fans were unbelievable. Hopefully it will be the same against Crystal Palace.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He is suitably wary of Palace\xe2\x80\x99s counterattacking capabilities on their travels. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are hard-working and very opportunistic,\xe2\x80\x9d said Advocaat. \xe2\x80\x9cThey get a lot of players behind the ball and counterattack. They have beaten many clubs away [five]. We have to be clever.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe have to [stop] thinking about Newcastle any more \xe2\x80\x93 I have told them that \xe2\x80\x93 because we have in principle five games in which we have to escape relegation.\xe2\x80\x9d Their last two are at Arsenal and Chelsea.</p> <p>The Palace game is further spiced by the fact that, while in charge of Newcastle, Alan Pardew lost his last four derbies against Sunderland. Palace\xe2\x80\x99s manager will be keen to change that narrative and, as a paid-up member of the Pardew fan club, Advocaat is not underestimating him.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAlan Pardew is an excellent coach,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI met him once in Spain when he was with Charlton, they were in Marbella training. We talked. He was a nice man. I liked him and from that moment I started following him. In my opinion he did a great job at Newcastle and he is doing a great job now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Advocaat, though, has a special weapon he intends to deploy against Palace. Despite the unseasonably warm weather Wearside is currently enjoying, the winter scarf he wore during the 1-0 win against Newcastle will be making another appearance. \xe2\x80\x9cI will wear my brown scarf,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is more successful than my grey one.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
