b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho: Chelsea losing to Bradford in FA Cup would be disgrace'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho said losing to Bradford City on Saturday would be a disgrace and that Chelsea must risk complicating their challenge for the Premier League because his mentality prevents him from making one competition a priority over another.</p> <p>Chelsea host Manchester City at Stamford Bridge next weekend in a match that promises to have major ramifications for the title race but Mourinho says that that battle will not lessen his focus on the FA Cup fourth-round meeting with Bradford or Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s Capital One Cup semi-final second leg against Liverpool.</p> <p>Although Mourinho acknowledged that he will make some alterations to his usual line-up for the visit of Bradford \xe2\x80\x93 with Kurt Zouma to start in place of the rested John Terry \xe2\x80\x93 the manager said it would be easier to win the Premier League if Chelsea were eliminated from all cup competitions but he cannot being himself to prepare for a defeat.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cTo help the title race, the best thing is to lose against Bradford and to lose against Liverpool and to lose against Paris Saint-Germain [in the Champions League] and to play only Premier League until the end of the season,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the perfect situation but not with us. Not with our mentality, not with our way of thinking about our job, not with Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s DNA. We want to go the more we can.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe other day a coach of a big team was knocked out of the cup and he was saying, \xe2\x80\x98Good, very good. This is perfect for us. Now we can focus on the other competitions.\xe2\x80\x99 If I lose against Bradford, I don\xe2\x80\x99t say that. I say it\xe2\x80\x99s a disgrace.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the way you are, the way you think. I prefer it very difficult and congested and lots of matches and risk of losing everything \xe2\x80\x93 there is a risk there \xe2\x80\x93 but I can\xe2\x80\x99t choose matches. I can\xe2\x80\x99t choose competitions. I can\xe2\x80\x99t. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to do it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to face my players, how to face my fans, by saying, \xe2\x80\x98This is not a competition we want to win.\xe2\x80\x99 We want to win. We want to win. When we lose, we lose. But we want to win.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle and Mohamed Salah are also in line to play against Bradford, with Mourinho claiming both players remain part of his plans for the remainder of the season despite being linked with transfers. Neither player has been able to dislodge Eden Hazard or Willian on a regular basis and a departure by one or both would pave the way for the Colombia winger Juan Cuadrado to join from Fiorentina. Salah is a target for Roma while Mourinho said Sch\xc3\xbcrrle would be allowed to leave only if Chelsea received a \xe2\x80\x9cphenomenal offer\xe2\x80\x9d and the German was \xe2\x80\x9csuper-keen\xe2\x80\x9d to go.</p>'
