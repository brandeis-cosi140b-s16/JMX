b'<p>Stamford Bridge will thrill in anticipation of Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s first Premier League title in five years. The hosts will secure the crown with victory and, given their unbeaten home record this season and Crystal Palace\xe2\x80\x99s recent slip in standards with safety assured, the opportunity is there for the taking. \xe2\x80\x9cThem winning the league would be deserved because they\xe2\x80\x99ve done extraordinarily well this season,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yannick Bolasie, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we don\xe2\x80\x99t want them to do it against us.\xe2\x80\x9d That may be wishful thinking given it is 33 years since Palace last won at Chelsea.
