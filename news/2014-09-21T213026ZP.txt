b'Papiss Ciss\xc3\xa9 and Jon\xc3\xa1s Guti\xc3\xa9rrez quell Newcastle fans\xe2\x80\x99 revolt'


b'<p>Alan Pardew broke a couple of supposedly cardinal rules but ended up wearing a cautious smile. It is supposed to be taboo for managers to criticise fans yet, last week, Newcastle United\xe2\x80\x99s manager accused his team\xe2\x80\x99s supporters of \xe2\x80\x9cmass hysteria\xe2\x80\x9d and, judging by Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s evidence, it seemed he shamed them into inaction.</p> <p>The anti-Pardew protests at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park never really happened \xe2\x80\x93 not even when Hull City took a two-goal lead. Admittedly, it probably helped that his second high-stakes, convention-shattering gamble began paying dividends at this delicate juncture.</p> <p>Papiss Ciss\xc3\xa9 only returned to training last Tuesday after an operation on a broken kneecap in April and Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s medical staff appeared adamant he was three weeks away from a return.</p> <p>Pardew prides himself on not rushing players back from injury but his team were struggling to convert chances, his job was very much on the line and, in his eyes, the Senegal striker looked ready to take a seat on the bench. With Hull heading for victory, the Newcastle manager instructed him to step off it and was rewarded when the No 9 scored twice to secure an unlikely point.</p> <p>Conscious that Ciss\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s knee requires strengthening and the surgeon had counselled caution, Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s physiotherapists were unhappy when the manager told them the forward would be involved but, with the club doctor on a course elsewhere, they lacked the authority to overrule him.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThankfully the doctor was away so he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a say in whether Papiss played,\xe2\x80\x9d Pardew said. \xe2\x80\x9cPapiss shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have played, he\xe2\x80\x99s trained for less than a week and he\xe2\x80\x99s got muscle wastage but he can sniff a goal out.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s manager had exhibited a similar nose for opportunity when he came out with those \xe2\x80\x9cmass hysteria\xe2\x80\x9d comments. At the time they appeared high risk but, rather like Rafael Ben\xc3\xadtez\xe2\x80\x99s outspoken, potentially sack-provoking broadside at hostile Chelsea fans after a cup win at Middlesbrough in 2013, they succeeded in creating an uneasy truce.</p> <p>Yet unlike Ben\xc3\xadtez, who added to Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s trophy cabinet during his stint as interim manager, Pardew is not bolstered by a stellar results record. His side have won only five Premier League games since 1 January and none this season, so an additional piece of clever public relations was also required on Tyneside.</p> <p>No one should doubt the sincerity of Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s players who all emerged for kick-off wearing shirts emblazoned with the name \xe2\x80\x9cJonas\xe2\x80\x9d and the number \xe2\x80\x9c18\xe2\x80\x9d but the supportive message they sent their winger Guti\xc3\xa9rrez, as he undergoes chemotherapy for testicular cancer, can only have helped conjure a sense of proportion.</p> <p>The crowd\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to express anything more than moderate disgruntlement towards the man in the home technical area \xe2\x80\x93 gentle chants and some jeers when Pardew collected a loose ball \xe2\x80\x93 may also have something to do with the reality that the venom whipped up about Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s manager on social media exaggerated the true feelings of the silent, if currently somewhat sullen, majority.</p> <p>It also helped that Newcastle played quite well, with Cheik Tiot\xc3\xa9 dominating midfield and Fabricio Coloccini and Remy Cabella enjoying decent afternoons. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fans took a neutral stance,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pardew. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not stupid enough to think they love me or support me but they waited to see what we could deliver and I think we delivered a good performance.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>With Emmanuel Rivi\xc3\xa8re, his lone striker, labouring forlornly, Newcastle threatened to unravel when two stunning goals \xe2\x80\x93 Nikica Jelavic\xe2\x80\x99s acrobatic volleyed scissor kick and the impressive Mohamed Diam\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s sublime 20-yard, left-foot shot \xe2\x80\x93 placed victory at Hull\xe2\x80\x99s door.</p> <p>Cue Ciss\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s intervention. First came the collection of Tiot\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s pass and a low shot squeezed inside Allan McGregor\xe2\x80\x99s near post. Then, when Yoan Gouffran beat the otherwise excellent Andrew Robertson to Moussa Sissoko\xe2\x80\x99s cross, Ciss\xc3\xa9 proved perfectly positioned to lash the resultant flick beyond the goalkeeper.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99d be playing,\xe2\x80\x9d Ciss\xc3\xa9 said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the trainer needed me. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s been very hard for him. But the news about Jonas put everything into perspective. On Friday night I spoke to Jonas and he told me to get a goal. So my goals were for him \xe2\x80\x93 and the gaffer too.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Curiously, when Steve Bruce was asked if he thought Newcastle were playing for Pardew he declined to be drawn. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get involved in all that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got to see it through.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Relations between the two managers seemed more than a little tense, this frostiness possibly reflecting rumours that Bruce would not be averse to working for Mike Ashley.</p> <p>Right now, though, Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s owner seems minded to offer Pardew limited patience. The next three league games \xe2\x80\x93 Stoke and Swansea away followed by Leicester at home \xe2\x80\x93 promise to be pivotal.</p> <p>Man of the match Cheik Tiot\xc3\xa9 (Newcastle)</p>'
