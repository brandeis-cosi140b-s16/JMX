b'Chelsea the fare for next beneficiaries of Steven Naismith\xe2\x80\x99s largesse'


b'<p>Four unemployed people will attend Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Goodison Park on Saturday courtesy of four season tickets that the Everton forward Steven Naismith bought and donated to Jobcentre Plus. The act drew widespread acclaim for a player now lauded by the Gwladys Street for his tireless influence on the team. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are losing the spine of what football is all about\xe2\x80\x9d is how the Scotland international eloquently, alarmingly puts it.</p> <p>Naismith is evidence that Premier League players are not impervious to the call for a reduction in the ticket prices from which they benefit. He insists he is far from alone and his message is timely. Spirit of Shankly and The Blue Union, Liverpool and Everton supporters groups, issued a joint statement this week entitled The Greed of Modern Football after their requests for a reciprocal ticket price reduction for the Anfield and Goodison derbies were rejected by the city\xe2\x80\x99s two clubs.</p> <p>Both groups are involved in the nationwide Affordable Football for All campaign that resulted in each Premier League club agreeing to set aside \xc2\xa3200,000 for away supporters\xe2\x80\x99 initiatives last summer. Meanwhile, Arsenal charge non-members \xc2\xa397 for a category A game at the Emirates Stadium. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we approach clubs with such proposals,\xe2\x80\x9d the statement read, \xe2\x80\x9cthey either hide behind existing plans or say that it requires a national response.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we approach the Premier League, they tell us they have no power over the clubs and we need to approach them. They are batting us back and forth in the direction of each other, trying to play ping-pong with us. But we won\xe2\x80\x99t be drawn into this game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It must be clarified that Naismith has not been speaking in relation to this week\xe2\x80\x99s joint statement or demanding his employers reduce admission charges to Goodison, a stadium at the lower end of the Premier League price scale. But, like many, he looks on with admiration and envy at the model of the Bundesliga.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard because so many different people [at clubs] have so many targets to hit and they are all contradicting each other,\xe2\x80\x9d says Naismith, who recalls paying \xc2\xa320 to get into Ibrox in Glasgow. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot look too far from German football: how they play, how they run the league. I remember reading that Bayern Munich can afford to lower their prices and it means they are losing out on around \xc2\xa32m. That is not a lot of money to Bayern but to a club like Everton \xc2\xa32m is a lot of money. It is about finding the right balance. But prices can\xe2\x80\x99t get out of hand because we are losing the spine of what football is all about.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Naismith\xe2\x80\x99s latest act of generosity \xe2\x80\x93 he supports homeless shelters in Glasgow and Liverpool, including paying to host their Christmas dinners \xe2\x80\x93 stemmed from that fear over football\xe2\x80\x99s future. \xe2\x80\x9cThe price of football is getting more expensive and more fans who\xe2\x80\x99d probably gone for years were struggling to go any more, that was the idea behind it,\xe2\x80\x9d explains the 27-year-old. \xe2\x80\x9cBut without being able to just pick people, and not knowing if you\xe2\x80\x99d picked the right ones, we thought we would speak to the local job centres who would know who was trying hard to get back into employment and maybe had a few setbacks and could do with a morale boost. It\xe2\x80\x99s worked really well. We spoke to the people who went to the first game and they were delighted. They said it made a really big difference to them.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey were mad-keen Evertonians who hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been for a few years because of the prices but I was amazed how much they knew about Everton and its history. On the same day we met one of the guys, he got a job. He\xe2\x80\x99d been knocked back for a couple so it was a great day for him. It is a simple idea that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take too much organising. Everton are doing a great job distributing them. They make sure they get to the right people.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The former Kilmarnock and Rangers player has made an impressive start to the season with Everton, scoring against Leicester City and Arsenal only for late equalisers to reduce them to two 2-2 draws. His form is a continuation of his influence on the run-in last season and, after a difficult start to his Everton career due to injury and being deployed out wide, his name now reverberates from the Gwladys Street end.</p> <p>Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s arrival will focus the spotlight on Romelu Lukaku and Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o against their former club but Naismith\xe2\x80\x99s contribution should not be overlooked. \xe2\x80\x9cWe needed to make big signings to progress the club,\xe2\x80\x9d says the striker, who scored the winner in the corresponding fixture last season.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut I never thought I should play second fiddle to anyone. I came with the mindset that I can play in the team and contribute to it. I always believed in my ability. It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to hear people talking about you but that can be short-lived.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
