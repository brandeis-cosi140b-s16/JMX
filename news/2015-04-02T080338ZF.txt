b'Football transfer rumours: Bas Dost to Swansea City?'


b'<p>The 15 goals scored for Wolfsburg by Bas Dost this season have got antennae twitching in various Premier League HR departments, with Swansea rumoured to have concrete interest in bringing the 25-year-old Dutchman to the Liberty Stadium as a replacement for the recently departed Wilfried Bony. According to German newspaper Bild, Newcastle, Southampton and Stoke City are also keeping an eye on the 25-year-old, who is likely to cost somewhere in the region of \xc2\xa315m. With Dost\xe2\x80\x99s exit from the Volkswagen Arena looking increasingly likely, talk suggests Wolfsburg may replace him with Javier Hernandez, who is currently on loan at Real Madrid from Manchester United but seems unlikely to be on the books of either club next season.</p> <p>As exciting as all that is, the question on everyone\xe2\x80\x99s lips concerns whether or not a certain versatile young midfielder will or will not be a Liverpool player next season. Ostensibly a winger but capable of playing in a variety of forward roles, this rough diamond proved quite the crowd-pleaser during his breakthrough season on Merseyside but is currently the source of much speculation that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be heading for pastures new next season. On loan at Sevilla following last season\xe2\x80\x99s spell at Everton, Gerard Deulofeu has apparently been deemed surplus to Camp Nou requirements by his parent club Barcelona and could move to Anfield this summer.</p> <p>The 21-year-old, who has failed to establish himself at Seville, is also being linked with a return to Everton, after Spain Under-21 manager Albert Celades questioned the likelihood of him making the breakthrough at Barcelona. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be very difficult for Deulofeu to succeed at Barcelona,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNot every player can succeed at Barcelona. Time will tell us how far Deulofeu goes in football.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Time will also tell us how far Angel Di Maria goes in football, although various media outlets tell us it won\xe2\x80\x99t be the 499 miles that separate Manchester and Paris. Reports suggest the Argentinian winger is not even remotely interested in moving to Paris Saint-Germain in a \xc2\xa360m deal and would rather stay at Old Trafford, where he has endured a miserable maiden season. \xe2\x80\x9cNone of this business about PSG is coming from Angel and he has no interest in going there,\xe2\x80\x9d a mysterious source told The Sun. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is true things have not gone as he would have liked so far, but he is determined to make it work at United.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Sporting Clube de Portugal have been admiring the well-tailored cut of Sadio Man\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s jib and will attempt to lure the versatile Southampton playmaker to the Est\xc3\xa1dio Jos\xc3\xa9 Alvalade come season\xe2\x80\x99s end. The 22-year-old G\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9ration Foot academy graduate has impressed at St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s this season and would cost Sporting considerably more than the \xc2\xa311.8m Saints paid to recruit him from Red Bull Salzburg.</p> <p>Those little green and yellow blobs doing the samba across the Juventus radar have been identified as Chelsea duo Ramires and Oscar. Oscar is a long-term target of the Italian champions, while Gazzetta della Sport say Ramires has been identified as a likely replacement for Paul Pogba. Elsewhere in Italy, Inter will bid the thick end of \xc2\xa344m for Manchester City midfielder Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 and would also quite like to take his club team-mate Stevan Jovetic on loan in a deal the Montenegrin\xe2\x80\x99s Etihad paymasters would rather make permanent.  </p> <p>The five goals scored by Mohamed Salah since moving to Fiorentina on loan from Chelsea in January have been enough to convince La Viola to agree a permanent move worth \xc2\xa313m for the Egyptian winger, but the small print in his contract means they\xe2\x80\x99ll be forced to wait until the end of next season to do so.</p> <p>At the Britannia Stadium, Stoke City suits have gone all 50 Shades of Grey and are close to \xe2\x80\x9ctying Asmir Begovic down\xe2\x80\x9d to a new five-year deal, although idle chit-chat regarding a potential move to Manchester United can be heard if you listen really intently.</p> <p>And in managerial tittle-tattle, Sam Allardyce is being lined up as the next manager of QPR if, as expected, he parts company with West Ham when his contract expires this summer.</p>'
