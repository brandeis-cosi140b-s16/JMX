b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s message from the top is keep calm and carry on'


b'<p>Title races are supposed to leave even elite managers frazzled. The pressure tends to tell over the run-in, Sir Alex Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s infamous \xe2\x80\x9csqueaky bum time\xe2\x80\x9d rendering the most experienced figures diminished in their dugouts as they sense the chasing pack closing in at pace and their lead being whittled away. So, with that in mind, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s mood on the eve of the visit of resurgent Manchester United to south-west London provided a fair barometer of the anxiety gripping at Chelsea.</p> <p>There was sympathy with the complaints voiced by Steve Clarke and Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger over the clash between Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup semi-final and the most enticing Premier League game of the weekend, and bemusement at the maelstrom embroiling the champions, Manchester City. He even joked about match delegates spending too much time eating their \xe2\x80\x9csushi and lobster\xe2\x80\x9d and supping \xe2\x80\x9cfine Champagne, Cristal\xe2\x80\x9d in the lounges at Stamford Bridge. \xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t see the games but just stay eating and drinking,\xe2\x80\x9d he offered through a broad grin when attempting to explain how his side had been ranked worst in the division when it came to respect for the officials. \xe2\x80\x9cWe should feed them bread and water.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>All was calm, utterly at ease, almost jolly. Contrast that with the atmosphere a year ago when Mourinho, his mood darkened by a succession of Football Association disciplinary charges and a cramped fixture schedule with a Champions League semi-final still to come, had dispatched his assistant Steve Holland to conduct the media briefing before the visit of bottom-placed Sunderland. Chelsea would have been top with three to play had they won that game. Instead they surrendered the manager\xe2\x80\x99s 77-game unbeaten home record in the division and were effectively jettisoned from the title race, with Mourinho and his staff left livid by the officials. There would be further sanctions for their snarled reaction later in the month.</p> <p>A year on and all is very much more relaxed. The leaders have lost their top scorer, Diego Costa, to another hamstring injury and his back-up Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my to a calf strain \xe2\x80\x93 with Dominic Solanke, 17, on the bench instead \xe2\x80\x93 but Chelsea are seven points clear of Arsenal and eight of United with a game in hand on each. The message being transmitted from Cobham was that, for all they care, the pressure can fester elsewhere.</p> <p>The closest rivals in the pursuit await in the leaders\xe2\x80\x99 next two matches, Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s visit of a United side who have won their past six league games being followed by a trip to an Arsenal team who are on a run of eight straight victories, but the onus is on those playing catch-up to make this race properly interesting.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI know the ideal scenario for people in this country would be for the Premier League to be more like the Championship, with four teams separated by a couple of points and nobody knowing who is going to be promoted or even in the play-offs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, since day one, we have been top. We are boring.\xe2\x80\x9d They have achieved, lost and regained a hefty lead en route but have suffered only two defeats in 31 league games. Life may have become more of a grind in recent months, with key performers off colour or hampered by niggling injuries, but they have still been relentless.</p> <p>Other sides would have been held by a stubborn Queens Park Rangers team last Sunday but Chelsea pilfered a winner late on with their only shot on target. If only privately, the sight of Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas scoring and John Terry leading the post-match celebrations on the pitch at Loftus Road must have knocked the stuffing out of those teams who count themselves as challengers.</p> <p>United are principal among them. Their dismantling of City in the derby confirmed that Louis van Gaal, once Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s mentor, is overseeing a team who will be capable of restoring the club to the pinnacle. Go unblemished from now until the end of the season, winning at Stamford Bridge and overcoming Arsenal at Old Trafford on 17 May, and could they still have a chance? \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s still possible,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Dutchman. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not logical but it is possible. It\xe2\x80\x99s more when and if \xe2\x80\x93 and I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in when and if. I believe in facts. The fact is that we are behind Chelsea. All right, we have to play against them and so do Arsenal, so we can lay pressure on Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders. You never know. You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it in previous Premier League seasons \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He will need his team to buck a trend and click from the outset at the Bridge if the first wound is to be inflicted. Van Gaal conceded his side \xe2\x80\x9chaven\xe2\x80\x99t played well for 90 minutes\xe2\x80\x9d under his stewardship, citing even the opening 15 minutes against City as slack. They will travel without Michael Carrick, Daley Blind, Phil Jones, Jonny Evans and Marcos Rojo, surely weakening their challenge. \xe2\x80\x9cI disagree because their squad is amazing, in numbers, players, experience, solutions,\xe2\x80\x9d offered Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery week in my office we put up on the big screen the squad and the options our opponents will have. When I looked this week, for the first time I realised what they have. It\xe2\x80\x99s amazing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>One of their options is Juan Mata, a player sold by Chelsea as part of their new policy of balancing lavish purchases with heftier sales. So does Uefa\xe2\x80\x99s financial fair play now play into United\xe2\x80\x99s hands? \xe2\x80\x9cYes, it\xe2\x80\x99s easier for them,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was easier before at Chelsea. We sold a lot of players, not just Juan, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s more fun like this. More difficult of course but more fun.\xe2\x80\x9d Even working within financial constrictions is apparently enjoyable these days.</p> <p>he Portuguese insisted this season\xe2\x80\x99s race, for all its lack of variety at the top, had been tougher than ever, with the challenge offered up from teams in mid-table, or even those near the foot, rendering everything a grind. Which makes him all the more baffled, even after six defeats in eight games, by the recent criticism of City\xe2\x80\x99s manager, Manuel Pellegrini. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised about is that people can bring this team to hell, a side that won two titles in three years, a team who are still champions and won two trophies last season. It looks like they don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve respect, that they are bad players, that the manager is a bad manager, that they are a disaster \xe2\x80\x93 but they are the champions.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. On the one hand people want competitiveness in this country and you don\xe2\x80\x99t like a team to win two titles in a row or be dominant. You want lots of teams fighting for the title. OK, they won\xe2\x80\x99t win the Premier League this time but they did last year. Some managers cannot win and \xe2\x80\x98life goes on\xe2\x80\x99 but the guys at Manchester City? It looks like they\xe2\x80\x99re criminals.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>While tacit praise for Pellegrini may simply have been an indication Mourinho does not consider City under the Chilean\xe2\x80\x99s stewardship a threat, there was a thinly veiled poke at Wenger in that argument. That suggests the buildup to the trip to Arsenal next weekend could be spikier but, for now, the angst is all elsewhere. Chelsea are 11 points from their first title in five years. Those at their back can only live in hope.</p>'
