Milan are understood to be confident of concluding a deal for the Dutchman.</p> <p>The Italian club are also expected to test Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s resolve to keep Fernando Torres as they seek a striker to replace Mario Balotelli, who has joined Liverpool.</p> <p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has insisted over recent days that Torres will not be leaving. The Chelsea manager\xe2\x80\x99s stance is unlikely to change unless his interest in Roma\xe2\x80\x99s forward Mattia Destro leads to the 23-year-old joining.</p> <p>That would seem unlikely given that Roma on Tuesday sold another of their leading players, the defender Mehdi Benatia, to Bayern Munich.</p>'
