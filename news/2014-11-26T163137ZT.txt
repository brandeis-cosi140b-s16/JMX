b'The Fiver: Won\xe2\x80\x99t Somebody Think of the Gooners | Michael Butler'


b'WENGER\xe2\x80\x99S SONG REMAINS THE SAME <p>Poor Arsenal fans. Won\xe2\x80\x99t somebody think of the Gooners? Each week, win, lose or draw, pre-match or post, these hardy souls are forced to listen to Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s musings: weekly updates on Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s quality or mentality or belief or on whether something is mathematically possible or his aversion to seeing incidents clearly.</p> <p>The Fiver has had just about enough of Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s delusional wittering and unlike a certain furry dinosaur who gads about the Emirates burdened with the increasingly difficult task of boosting morale, our features don\xe2\x80\x99t have a prehistoric default setting of \xe2\x80\x98rictus grin\xe2\x80\x99. But back to Wenger. An Arsenal legend that revolutionised the English game? No doubt. A world-class manager that is probably two or three signings away from having a team that could win the Premier League? Perhaps. But even if it for the purposes of more interesting press conferences, the Fiver wonders whether we might all be better off listening to somebody other than Wenger.</p> <p>And look! Here they come, right on cue! It\xe2\x80\x99s Arsenal v Dortmund in Big Cup tonight and like the manifestation of Dwight Schrute\xe2\x80\x99s cool younger brother armed with a copy of Inverting the Pyramid, J\xc3\xbcrgen Klopp has beardedly bounded into Blighty to save the day. Winning smile? Tick! Hipster beard/glasses combo? You betcha! Bit of a nutter? Holla at ya boi!</p> <p>Dortmund have already qualified from Group D and go into tonight\xe2\x80\x99s match at the Emirates five points clear of Arsenal, leading Klopp to treat this fixture \xe2\x80\x9ca little bit like a holiday\xe2\x80\x9d while his baffling assertion that \xe2\x80\x9cone comes to the other\xe2\x80\x9d was clarified by a club suit as meaning \xe2\x80\x9ceverything has an end but only the sausage has two ends\xe2\x80\x9d. Er, OK. The Fiver can think of plenty of things with two ends and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what any of it means in relation to football, but this tea-timely email likes Klopp\xe2\x80\x99s style.</p> <p>Wenger responded in kind. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is important is how close we are together inside the club and how much we can respond to people who question our quality,\xe2\x80\x9d the Frenchman buzz-killed, copying-and-pasting words from every one of his pressers since 1996. \xe2\x80\x9cI personally feel there is a very strong bond inside the team and the club, and that this team will have a very strong season. I believe in what I do and I especially believe in my players, and in their quality and spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s not even the vocabulary that the Fiver so resents, it\xe2\x80\x99s the hollow optimism. Oi! Ars\xc3\xa8ne! Your team is already out of the title race and struggling to hang onto apparently insurmountable leads in Europe despite spending nearly \xc2\xa380m over the summer. Tell us how you really feel. We know you want to. Or at least throw a riddle our way, sausage-based or otherwise.

I hate that someone doubts my commitment. I have played many games [for Spain] and have joined the national team many times without playing. I\xe2\x80\x99ve played a total of 94 games for Spain, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been going for nine years, always. And with a big smile. I already told Sergio what I thought about it. I told him that we played together since the U21s and there was no need for him to send messages through the press. I said to him that he could call me up and tell it to my face. Everything is clear now and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we had to do, to speak\xe2\x80\x9d - Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas clearly took exception to having his commitment question by his international team-mate Sergio Ramos, the Real Madrid defender who once left a match against Valladolid early so he could go watch one of his friends participate in a bullfight.</p> THE SECRET FOOTBALLER\xe2\x80\x99S GUIDE TO THE MODERN GAME \xe2\x80\x93 EXCLUSIVE OFFER FOR FIVER READERS <p>Fiver readers can get The Secret Footballer\xe2\x80\x99s Guide to the Modern Game for just \xc2\xa37.49 (RRP \xc2\xa312.99).

Can we assume that because CSKA and Roma\xe2\x80\x99s match was (a) already finished by the time Manchester City kicked off against Bayern and (b) the outcome was not crucial to their chances of Big Cup survival, Manuel Pellegrino\xe2\x80\x99s players were therefore relaxed and duly able to focus exclusively on the task of hammering their German opponents?\xe2\x80\x9d - Al Horan (and 1,056 others).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMonday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver, and Ben Graham\xe2\x80\x99s response to it (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver Letters), contained a welcome mention of a Liverpool player from the 1970s who, unlike many of his contemporaries and successors, has not taken to high-profile media work. In fact, perhaps he should be renamed The Lost Heighway\xe2\x80\x9d - Ed Quoth the Raven (and no other Hank Williams fans).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI spent the first half of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Big Cup match between Manchester City and Bayern Munich looking up all the unfamiliar players that had been preferred to Richard Wright and Scott Sinclair in the two matchday squads. Some pedants may have noted that Gianluca Gaudino, the unused Bayern sub, is the son of Mauricio, who was on loan at City the last time they managed to play in Europe and get relegated in the same season (1994-95). Though if that is a stretch too far back for the collective memory, Mauricio was also the recipient of that Boris Johnson tackle in an England v Germany charity match in 2006, when the Mayor temporarily forgot which sport he was playing. With Bayern going down to 10 men in the first half, perhaps Pep Guardiola decided it was best for Anglo-German relations not to bring Gaudino Junior. Chelsea can await his retribution in the knock out stages\xe2\x80\x9d - Phil Coales.</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@guardian.co.uk.

Burglars took the midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s Range Rover (since recovered), more than 20 pairs of shoes, designer duds, jewellery, money, electrical items and a shirt given to him by Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s Andres Iniesta from his Hampshire home while he was away playing Aston Villa.</p> <p>Aston Villa have taken steps to end the goal drought that has seen them score just two goals in their past eight games by loaning striker and \xc2\xa318m record signing Darren Bent to Brighton on a one-month loan deal.</p> <p>Schalke general manager Horst Heldt has conducted the post mortem of his side\xe2\x80\x99s 5-0 home defeat at the hands of Chelsea in Big Cup last night and is not best pleased with the results. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the first half above all we did everything wrong that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to do wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d he harrumphed. \xe2\x80\x9cWe put in an embarrassing performance, never went into challenges and didn\xe2\x80\x99t defend ourselves.
