b'<p>TRICKY VILLA</p> <p>Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Aston Villa was always going to be an intriguing battle between teams managed by a pair of youthful up-and-coming managers regularly tipped for great things by themselves. In the red corner: Brendan Rodgers, whose team has taken four points from the 21 available to them against sides above them in the table so far this season. The same Brendan Rodgers whose undeniable qualities as a coach are rarely questioned, but whose abilities as a manager are under scrutiny on the back of some poor transfer activity, rumours he has \xe2\x80\x9clost\xe2\x80\x9d the dressing room, a group stage Big Cup exit and his team\xe2\x80\x99s worrying reputation for choking on the big occasion. In the claret and blue corner: Tim Sherwood, a gilet-wearing comparative whelp of the management game, who invented Harry Kane, did reasonably well at Spurs, was until yesterday doing reasonably well at Aston Villa and whose propensity for talking like an actual human being provides a welcome press conference antidote to the often baffling management babble peddled by his opposite number. Who would prevail?</p> <p>With the gods having apparently decided that Liverpool were a shoo-in because it meant $tevie Mbe would get to lift the FA Cup on the occasion of his birthday and last match for the club, The Fiver is surprised Villa even bothered turning up. But turn up they did, surprising most right-thinking people in the process with a narrative-busting come-from-behind win to book a place against Arsenal in the final and force a forlorn $tevie to book an alternative venue to Wembley Stadium for his birthday party.</p> <p>It was no fluke either. While Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s players failed to deliver as a collective, Tactics Tim managed to bamboozle Brendan by playing Jack Grealish and Charles N\xe2\x80\x99Zogbia as inside-out false trequartistas and the pair tormented Emre Can to within an inch of his life. The German was forced to make his debut appearance as a right-back in one of a few different Liverpool formations that failed to answer the questions posed by re-energised Villa\xe2\x80\x99s vim and vigour. \xe2\x80\x9cWe looked at Liverpool and thought it might cause them a few problems if we played two No10s and it turned out that way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tim, clearly no relation of the Tactics Tim who has previously aired a theory that No10s are just strikers that don\xe2\x80\x99t score goals.</p> <p>Looking highly unlikely to reel in Manchester City and having left it a bit late for what \xe2\x80\x98Arry Redknapp labels \xe2\x80\x9cthe scramble to avoid qualification for [Big Vase],\xe2\x80\x9d it is difficult to know what the short and long term future holds for Brendan. While his players ought to shoulder much of the responsibility for yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s flat performance, it is far from the first time he has failed to motivate them on the big stage. \xe2\x80\x9cDealing with the occasion is something we need to improve at,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere have been other big games where we have dealt with that very well, but there are others where we haven\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d We can only hope the next big occasion in which Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s players get to test themselves ends more happily, with 35 successfully extinguished birthday candles and No Jacket Required on the decks. </p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere are a lot of ways of finding out when training is. And it is not as if there is that much traffic in Wolfsburg\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 club suit Klaus Allofs reveals Nicklas Bendtner was dropped because he was late for training.
