b'Kenny Lowe: the man leading Perth Glory to the top of the table'


b'<p>Kenny Lowe jokes that when he leaves Perth Glory, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be the first club to ever give him the sack. It certainly won\xe2\x80\x99t be under the same circumstances as his predecessor, Alistair Edwards, who was shown the door last season amid claims of favouritism involving the selection of his two sons.</p> <p>No, Lowe\xe2\x80\x99s son, Rory, has found his calling away from football: stand-up comedy. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve only watched him once or twice,\xe2\x80\x9d says Lowe senior, a tad awkwardly. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll leave him to it. It\xe2\x80\x99s probably good that me and the mum don\xe2\x80\x99t go. We\xe2\x80\x99d probably get hammered by him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Lowe senior was around the same age as his son is now when he first came to Perth. The young midfielder from County Durham only stayed one full season, but it was the best year of his life. The America\xe2\x80\x99s Cup was on, he was making lifelong friends, and trophies were piling up for him and for his state league side.</p> <p>The city has had a profound impact on Kenny Lowe. As an oil and gas engineer in his late thirties, he returned there with his family, and they found it impossible to leave. Twelve years later, he\xe2\x80\x99s added two more to the clan - \xe2\x80\x9cour two little Aussies,\xe2\x80\x9d he calls them - and, almost from nowhere, he has become the hottest coach in the A-League.</p> <p>At least for now. The following week could be a defining one for the Westralians\xe2\x80\x99 season. With back-to-back games against their biggest premiership rivals, Perth Glory could go into the Asian Cup break a good 10 points clear of the pack. Equally, they might spend January slumming it in third.</p> <p>The league leaders are at long odds for a win at Melbourne Victory on Friday night. It seems extraordinary, until you look at Victory\xe2\x80\x99s home form. They\xe2\x80\x99ve been almost unbeatable there under Kevin Muscat\xe2\x80\x99s watch. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened since January, and their worst home result this season has been a solitary draw (though they did lose at Melbourne City).</p> <p>In Adelaide United, Glory will face the only side able to beat them so far this campaign. It\xe2\x80\x99s something the Reds have managed twice: first in round three, and then again in the final of the inaugural FFA Cup. Yet Lowe sounds almost thankful for those results.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou have hardship. You have defeat. You have failure. That\xe2\x80\x99s probably the best time in the world to learn about yourself and get better,\xe2\x80\x9d he tells The Guardian.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBecause there\xe2\x80\x99s things in that experience that you can actually analyse and understand to help make yourself become even better.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>What he learnt from those games is that Glory needs to be better with the ball, and control the tempo of the game more effectively.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not rocket science. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want my goal-keeper having more touches than my creative central midfield player. We do need a balance.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He has another explanation for Adelaide too. \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got good players,\xe2\x80\x9d he laughs. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not hard, is it. And they play a way that suits their good players.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Against the rest of the competition though, Perth have been so dominant they have spent barely 70 minutes - or 7% of the season - in arrears.</p> <p>So what\xe2\x80\x99s been the secret to success so far this season? Lowe speaks in one breath about a blue collar work rate and the good character of his team, and then in the next about the importance of quality players.</p> <p>There\xe2\x80\x99s Andy Keogh, for example, the new recruit whose form in front of goal is making it difficult for Ireland\xe2\x80\x99s national selectors to ignore him.</p> <p>Lowe is a firm believer in the old maxim about great players making great coaches. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy\xe2\x80\x99s Mourinho good?,\xe2\x80\x9d he asks. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s good because he\xe2\x80\x99s good, but it does help he\xe2\x80\x99s got some of the best players in the world. Get him to Hartlepool on a wet night in the middle of winter in England and see how good he is then.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Lowe might have a minor obsession with the Portuguese. His name is scattered throughout the interview and a cursory glance of his Twitter account brings up more than the one tweet about his Chelsea counterpart. Might it explain why he likes to compare Glory with Atletico Madrid, Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s former crosstown rivals?</p> <p>All that said, as Perth\xe2\x80\x99s youth coach, he was responsible for developing the likes of Fulham\xe2\x80\x99s Adam Taggart, Holland-based pair Trent Sainsbury and Eli Babalj, and Roma-bound boy wonder Danny De Silva. \xe2\x80\x9cIt gives you a real buzz to see those players doing really, really well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Character and quality are both good, but Perth\xe2\x80\x99s current success has arguably been shaped something more specific: set pieces. Exactly half of their goals have come from dead balls. No team has scored more goals this way. By comparison, Victory have scored barely one in three this way, Adelaide one in 5. </p> <p>At the other end of the park, they\xe2\x80\x99ve conceded just a quarter of their goals this way; Victory and Reds, the stingiest defences in the competition, have proved the league\xe2\x80\x99s most vulnerable at set pieces. In other words, the longer Perth\xe2\x80\x99s opponents this week can keep the ball the motion, the better chance they stand.</p> <p>For all the dangers Muscat and Gombau\xe2\x80\x99s sides pose though, it\xe2\x80\x99s a potential salary cap breach that could prove most damaging to Glory\xe2\x80\x99s season. On that topic, the Perth coach is giving nothing away. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t even speak about it,\xe2\x80\x9d he stonewalls.</p> <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the big unknowns in a season where nearly everything else has gone right, and could stop this season from being as fruitful for Lowe as his first in Perth was.</p>'
