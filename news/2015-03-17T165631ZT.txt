b'YEAH, WHATEVER <p>WWDWWLWWWWWLWWWLWWWW</p> <p>That\xe2\x80\x99s Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s results in all competitions since their 3-2 defeat at Stoke back on the first Saturday of December. You\xe2\x80\x99ll notice the number of Ws in there. That\xe2\x80\x99s a whole lot of W. Find yourself a highlighter pen and colour in every W on that line and what you\xe2\x80\x99ll see - and the Fiver knows because the Fiver did it \xe2\x80\x93 is a great bright streak of highlights. And then you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to clean your computer screen very thoroughly.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe have a little belief,\xe2\x80\x9d Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger said the other day. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have no belief, you have no chance. We have to have belief, and give everything.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of course they have belief. That\xe2\x80\x99s three defeats, a single draw and 16 beautiful, bright Ws in 20 matches. There are a great many words that could be used to describe the Arsenal side that heads to Monaco this evening, and one of them is \xe2\x80\x9crampant\xe2\x80\x9d. In those 20 games they have scored five once, four twice, three thrice, two 11 times and nil just once. They are a fearsome footballing furnace and other teams have simply melted before them like blancmange in a bonfire.</p> <p>But while logic dictates that future opponents should approach their fixtures wobble-kneed with trepidation and wibble-lipped with cognisance of their own manifest inferiority, some of them may have spotted a tiny little chink in Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s gleaming armour. For while they are manifestly incredible against almost everybody, there is one kind of team against whom even this Arsenal side struggles: a good one.</p> <p>Against the duffers they\xe2\x80\x99re unrivalled. Of Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s last 20 matches 10 of them have been against the worst 11 sides in the Premier League (WWWWWWWWWWW) and two have been FA Cup ties against teams in the Championship (WW). Then they\xe2\x80\x99ve beaten eighth-placed Stoke at home and benefited from a dodgy back-pass to pip Manchester United on one of their bad days, but lost at Tottenham (seventh) and Southampton (sixth) and drawn at Liverpool (fifth), leaving their one truly outstanding result a 2-0 win at a Manchester City side in the middle of a five-game winless run and preparing to be humbled at home by Middlesbrough. Third in the league overall, in games against sides in the bottom half of the table they rank first, and against the rest of the top seven they average a point a game, worse than Liverpool, Manchester United, Manchester City, Chelsea and Tottenham, and equal to Stoke and Swansea. Their win at the Etihad was the only time this season, Community Shield notwithstanding, that they have beaten one of England\xe2\x80\x99s top sides by more than a single goal.</p> <p>Tonight they have to beat Monaco by two, and score at least three. They will, in other words, have to score as many goals as Monaco have shipped in their last 14 games put together, against a side yet to concede at all at home in the Champions League this season.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI am confident,\xe2\x80\x9d trilled Wenger. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the first leg we failed, which was surprising given our form. We have a second chance and we will exploit it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Yeah, whatever.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Jacob Steinberg for Monaco 0-2 Arsenal while Simon Burnton will have Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid 1-1 Bayer Leverkusen from 7.45pm tonight.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Milner\xe2\x80\x99s No1 fan. Find me a more complete English player. There are players who\xe2\x80\x99re better technically, yes. Quicker players, yes. Players who head better, yes. But show me one who does all the things Milner does well. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t one. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to leave him out. Respect, commitment and performance level: 10/10, fantastic. He\xe2\x80\x99s polyfunctional: full-back \xe2\x80\x93 the only position he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like \xe2\x80\x93 attacking midfield, wide. I played him as a forward and the team averaged three goals a game. He gives everything. You leave him on the bench and he\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely furious but watch him during the game: encouraging, shouting, supporting. And in the next training session he kills himself. Milner\xe2\x80\x99s a phenomenon, a guy with big balls and a heart this big\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Manuel Pellegrini loses the run of himself in praise of James Milner.
