b'Roy Hodgson: I see Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard managing England'


b'<p>Roy Hodgson has said both Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard have the potential to be England manager despite neither of them having finished playing yet or made an initial foray into coaching.</p> <p>Comparisons between the two midfielders have seemed endless during their decorated playing careers but, with both departing the Premier League for the United States, attention has already turned to which of Lampard and Gerrard will make the better manager.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cProbably, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d Hodgson said when asked if they could one day be in charge of England. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore that I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the first people who will try to get hold of them when they return will be Liverpool and Chelsea. I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure of that but who\xe2\x80\x99s to say they can\xe2\x80\x99t be members in an English set-up as well? They certainly know England. They\xe2\x80\x99ve both had 100 caps but it\xe2\x80\x99s not only their playing ability. It\xe2\x80\x99s their leadership qualities. They\xe2\x80\x99re both leaders.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Hodgson refused to choose which would be the more likely, however. \xe2\x80\x9cBoth of them have the same ability to do that. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to put a cigarette paper between them in that respect.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>When pushed further on giving an endorsement, however, the manager reined in his thoughts, saying it would be a decision for Greg Dyke, the chairman of the Football Association. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, then of course it\xe2\x80\x99s headlines: \xe2\x80\x98Hodgson says Gerrard or Lampard for England manager\xe2\x80\x99. I don\xe2\x80\x99t select the England manager, that\xe2\x80\x99s for sure, so that\xe2\x80\x99s a question for Greg. Ask Greg that one.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Hodgson was generous in his praise for both, saying they were role models for their international team-mates, adding he could not thank them enough for their contributions during his time in charge of England.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cTheir effect on English football over 18 years has been quite incredible but I\xe2\x80\x99d rather speak personally,\xe2\x80\x9d Hodgson added. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat they\xe2\x80\x99ve done for me during my time as England manager has been quite fantastic \xe2\x80\x93 not only on the field as players and in training as players but also as leaders and characters. They\xe2\x80\x99ve both been outstanding.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve been real role models for the rest of the players. They\xe2\x80\x99ve had a natural authority due to the fact they are such good players but they have used their authority in the right way to encourage the younger players to make certain that their strong ethos, which as a coaching staff we share, is spread out among all the players. I can\xe2\x80\x99t thank them enough for what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The manager also believes both will return from their US excursions with an increased wealth of knowledge and believes that will serve English football well in the future.</p> <p>Gerrard will join LA Galaxy in July and Lampard will finally appear for the new MLS franchise, New York City FC, having spent the season at Manchester City.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI really hope they enjoy their American adventures. I think they will. It will give an extra string to their bow. They will come back even stronger individuals and leaders than they already are. We will see an awful lot of benefits going forward with those two players. I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine a long\xe2\x80\x93term future in English football without major contributions from Gerrard and Lampard.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI wish them well and thank them for all the work they\xe2\x80\x99ve done for me and the country while I\xe2\x80\x99ve been manager.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s great that their contribution is so globally recognised and appreciated \xe2\x80\x93 not just among the English mass media, who know them so well, but worldwide. You won\xe2\x80\x99t find anybody who will tell you anything other than that Gerrard and Lampard are top top-class international players. I wish them well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
