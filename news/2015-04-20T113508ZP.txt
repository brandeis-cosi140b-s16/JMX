b'Patrick Bamford and Dele Alli aim high after landing Football League awards | Nick Ames'


b'<p>The Football League Awards are an agreeable setting for catching up with colleagues and, while glasses clinked around them at The Brewery in central London, two friends stood in animated conversation over a soft drink. Patrick Bamford and Dele Alli clearly need few cues to begin chatting but there was plenty for them to pore over here. Team-mates at MK Dons for the best part of a year until last January and close friends since, their trajectories have been inexorable and their achievements in winning this event\xe2\x80\x99s two biggest awards spoke of the thrilling potential held by two young English players who may be spending plenty more time in the capital next season.</p> <p>Bamford, who was on loan at the League One club for two spells during 2013, was named Championship Player of the Year, largely on account of the 17 goals he has scored for Middlesbrough \xe2\x80\x93 to whom he has been lent by Chelsea for the season \xe2\x80\x93 in their drive for promotion. He looked astonished to have won the award, which is voted for by league clubs\xe2\x80\x99 managers and apparently went in the 21-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s favour by a landslide, and said afterwards that he had given himself little chance against fellow nominees Troy Deeney and Daryl Murphy.</p>  <p> Related: Football League: your thoughts | Niall McVeigh </p>   <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it, honestly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bamford. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought the one I stood the best chance of winning was probably the Young Player of the Year award, especially with it being my last year eligible to win it. Winning this, as you saw from my facial expression, I was surprised [given that I was] up against Troy and Daryl.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It was in fact Alli who won the \xe2\x80\x98young player\xe2\x80\x99 award, which is a league-wide accolade. Alli, who is 19, joined Tottenham in February but was loaned back to MK Dons and has been on exceptional form for the third-placed side in their division, scoring 16 times from midfield. He will join up with Mauricio Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s squad in the summer and hopes to make his mark straight away.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI am not going to lie and say I am not going to try and get in the starting XI, but I am going to take each step as it comes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a big step up for me but I will fight for a place and do the best I can.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn this transfer window, towards the end, it was a bit of a rollercoaster for me. When it came out that I could go to Tottenham, I spoke to my agent and we had to think about the manager and all the pros and cons. We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of anything wrong \xe2\x80\x93 it is the perfect club for me, hopefully.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Both are genuinely pleasant-seeming young men and speak with confident articulacy. They are joined in that by Lewis Cook, the exceptional 18-year-old Leeds midfielder who was named Apprentice of the Year for the Championship, and it would not take a giant leap of the imagination to envisage all three having long careers at the top of the domestic and international games. First, Bamford and Alli have loan spells to complete and promotions to win, in the knowledge that they are being watched from above.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cChelsea don\xe2\x80\x99t just send you out and leave you to find your own way, they actually look after you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bamford. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have a loan watchman, Eddie Newton, who comes out every few months and checks you\xe2\x80\x99re OK, and they often send you clips of three games tied into each other, showing you what you can do better and what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done well. So I can\xe2\x80\x99t complain on that front \xe2\x80\x93 Chelsea have been really good and I think the loan system is really beneficial to people like me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>There is a clear intent to complete the job for Middlesbrough \xe2\x80\x93 Friday night\xe2\x80\x99s win at promotion rivals Norwich was \xe2\x80\x9ca massive result, nobody can put into words how much it meant to us\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 and the next stage of Bamford\xe2\x80\x99s development could well be another loan lower down in the Premier League. The long-term target, though, has not changed.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be at Chelsea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bamford. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my dream, to pull on that blue shirt, so hopefully it will come true.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn the Premier League, strikers are about 23 or 24 if they\xe2\x80\x99re playing week-in, week-out and at a club like Chelsea, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the money to go out and buy a world class striker like Diego Costa. And there\xe2\x80\x99s also that pressure to win trophies, win the league. It\xe2\x80\x99s just one of those things, you have to stick with it, be patient and hopefully the rewards will come.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>You expect that they will, with Bamford\xe2\x80\x99s season having been managed deliberately so that he would work under the auspices of Aitor Karanka, who assisted Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho at Real Madrid. It should be a campaign that finishes in the Czech Republic with England, for whom he would not turn down a Uefa Under-21 Championship call-up.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my aim. I had to pull out [of previous games] because I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a problem with my toe for the last few months, so I spoke to Gareth Southgate about it and he said make sure I\xe2\x80\x99m OK for the summer. The first priority is to get promoted with Middlesbrough, and then to try and win the Euros.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Alli is an outsider to join him and no international side would be keen on seeing the pair dovetail in the manner that they did at times for MK Dons last season. For now, Alli is happy to prioritise leaving his hometown club \xe2\x80\x93 which did not exist in its current form when he was born \xe2\x80\x93 as a Championship one.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be the perfect ending to a fairytale, really. Obviously, being from MK and playing for them my whole life, to get us promoted would be a dream come true.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was younger you would never see anyone walking around in MK tops, but the other day I was walking around and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe how many people were wearing MK Dons t-shirts, hats and stuff. The change has been massive and it is a club that is just going to keep going forwards.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>That is the only direction in which Bamford and Alli are moving. Sunday night\xe2\x80\x99s event could be likened to a send-off from the Football League for two players who, although surprised to be garlanded so generously, will probably continue their friendship on yet more exalted stages.</p>'
