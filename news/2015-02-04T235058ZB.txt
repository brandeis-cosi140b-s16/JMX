b'Birthday dream final alive for Steven Gerrard the peripheral visionary | Jamie Jackson'


b'<p>This 700th appearance of Steven Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s glittering career was the latest evidence of how Brendan Rodgers is building a Liverpool for that fast-approaching day when the captain is no longer at the club. The juncture arrives at the close of this season and while Gerrard is not yet Yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Man, he becomes ever more peripheral.</p> <p>A sign of these times was how his presence in this XI as a holding midfielder could be seen as a throwback move by Rodgers, who since a 3-0 defeat at Manchester United on 14 December has preferred Jordan Henderson, the vice-captain, and Lucas Leiva as his central pistons: a selection that has been the catalyst for Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s best form of the campaign, losing only once in 13 outings after this late, late victory over Bolton Wanderers.</p> <p>It may seem harsh to bill the Gerrard-Joe Allen combination Rodgers sent out here \xe2\x80\x93 and which had minimal effect during a sluggish first half against Neil Lennon\xe2\x80\x99s side \xe2\x80\x93 as a second-string duo, especially given the 34-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s fair claim at being the best to ever pull on the famous red shirt. Yet this is what Gerrard and Allen are, the latter having last played in the initial fourth-round encounter with Bolton on 24 January and previously featuring in the league in that dismal defeat to United.</p> <p>Going into this replay, Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 side had strung a fine run of form together that featured only one loss \xe2\x80\x93 in the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg at Chelsea \xe2\x80\x93 since the Old Trafford reverse. That Sunday in Manchester was the last time defeat in the Premier League has been tasted \xe2\x80\x93 a seven-match unbeaten sequence in the competition \xe2\x80\x93 as Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99s men have gradually clicked into the kind of form that took them close to last season\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League title.</p> <p>What has emerged is the de facto shape of Liverpool in the post-Gerrard era that starts next season. In this fresh 3-4-2-1 system Lucas and Henderson are the midfield generals, Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge \xe2\x80\x93 if he can stay healthy \xe2\x80\x93 the prime attacking forces, Philippe Coutinho the chief-supplier of trickery, with Emre Can, Martin Skrtel and Mamadou Sakho in defence, in front of a rejuvenated Simon Mignolet, the goalkeeper.</p> <p>While Skrtel was at fault for Eidur Gudjohnsen\xe2\x80\x99s 59th-minute penalty that gave Bolton the lead \xe2\x80\x93 the defender brought down Zach Clough \xe2\x80\x93 a key move as Rodgers formulated his blueprint was to shift Gerrard from the holding role to a freer detail.</p> <p>The pace of change engineered since by Rodgers is such that it was telling how his manager rested both Henderson, who was on the bench, and Lucas, who did not even make the match-day 18. While Sturridge\xe2\x80\x99s place sitting down alongside Henderson was due to Rodgers wanting to ease his star striker back following a long injury layoff, the vice-captain and his new midfield partner were being saved for Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s late-afternoon visit to Everton for the Merseyside derby.</p> <p>Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s ever-receding status meant it is reasonable to ponder if his starting spot against Bolton means he may not be in the XI for the 224th edition of the Liverpool-Everton squabble.</p> <p>Given Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s enduring class and how Goodison Park has proved a happy hunting ground during his 17 years at the club this would still be as much of a shock as his being left out for the Champions League game at Real Madrid this term.</p> <p>Yet by the time Gudjohnsen put Bolton ahead Henderson had replaced Adam Lallana and it was Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s place he initially took in midfield as the senior man went out wide.</p> <p>Only Allen\xe2\x80\x99s departure restored Gerrard centrally and though there had been flashes of the old style \xe2\x80\x93 one first-half pass served instantly into Sterling set the striker clear \xe2\x80\x93 the greater evidence was of how he is more muted these days, proving ineffective as Liverpool tried to avert being knocked out.</p> <p>Instead it was left to Sterling and Coutinho, two vibrant symbols of Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s brave new world, to do what Gerrard could not: score the late equaliser and even later winner respectively, and which ensured Liverpool went through and can still win the FA Cup.</p> <p>The final is on 30 May \xe2\x80\x93 the day when Gerrard turns 35. His dream of a supreme birthday triumph remains alive.</p>'
