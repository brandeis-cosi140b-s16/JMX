b'<p>Zlatan Ibrahimovic has accused Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s players of being \xe2\x80\x9cbabies\xe2\x80\x9d after the Paris Saint-Germain striker was sent off at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night.</p> <p>PSG advanced to the Champions League quarter-finals at Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s expense despite Ibrahimovic being shown a straight red card after 31 minutes, dismissed for a challenge on Oscar which looked more clumsy than malicious as he attempted to pull out of the 50-50 tackle.</p> <p>The Dutch referee, Bjorn Kuipers, was quick to make his decision, although he was surrounded by nine Chelsea players as he pulled the card out of his top pocket. Ibrahimovic said: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I have to get angry or start to laugh. For me when I saw the red card I was like \xe2\x80\x98the guy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing\xe2\x80\x99.</p>     PSG\xe2\x80\x99s Zlatan Ibrahimovic reacts after having fouled Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Oscar, for which he was sent off. The 10 men, however, went on to knock Chelsea out. Photograph: Alastair Grant/AP    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not the worst. The worst is when I got the red card all the Chelsea players come around. It felt like I had a lot of babies around me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Sweden striker also suggested Oscar feigned injury. \xe2\x80\x9cI pulled out [of the tackle], because I saw him come in the tackle,\xe2\x80\x9d Ibrahimovic said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he was acting afterwards. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. We won the game, we went through and let\xe2\x80\x99s see what happens.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho: Chelsea lost because we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t cope with the pressure </p>   <p>The 33-year-old lauded the performance of his team-mates, who defied the numerical disadvantage to twice come from behind and progress on away goals courtesy of a 2-2 draw - 3-3 on aggregate.</p>           Chelsea could not handle PSG pressure, says Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was an amazing performance because we were playing with one less [player],\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cThey played with big hearts. It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to play with 10 guys, especially against a team like Chelsea. We showed quality and big heart.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>PSG will not be able to overturn Ibrahimovic\xe2\x80\x99s red card despite Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho calling on the European governing body to cancel the dismissal.</p> <p>Uefasaid referees\xe2\x80\x99 decisions were viewed as final unless ithere was a case of mistake identity. \xe2\x80\x9cDecisions taken by the referee on the field of play are final and may not be reviewed by the Uefa disciplinary bodies,\xe2\x80\x9d the European governing body said.</p>'
