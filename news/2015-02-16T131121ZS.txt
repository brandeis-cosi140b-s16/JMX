b'<p>Claudio Lotito has made headlines many times in his 11 years as Lazio owner. As Gazzetta dello Sport noted on Saturday, even his surname is an anagram of \xe2\x80\x98titolo\xe2\x80\x99. Forthright and loquacious, his colourful turns of phrase make for entertaining news stories. This is a man who reflected last summer that his would-be adversaries \xe2\x80\x9cthought they had a cow by the tits, when in fact they had taken a bull by the balls.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>But just because Lotito is good for a one-liner does not mean that all his lines are good. In December, he was fined by the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) over a nasty quip directed at the Juventus CEO, Beppe Marotta, who suffers from a condition, strabismus, which causes his eyes to improperly align. \xe2\x80\x9cThe problem with Marotta,\xe2\x80\x9d Lotito said, \xe2\x80\x9cis that he plays pool with one eye and adds up points with the other.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Those words were roundly condemned, but also soon forgotten. In a league boasting more than its fair share of outspoken presidents, such personal polemics tend to fade out of the public consciousness rather quickly. But the same might not be true for the conversation that Lotito had last month with Pino Iodice, a director at the Lega Pro (Italian third-tier) club Ischia Isolaverde \xe2\x80\x93 a recording of which was published on La Repubblica\xe2\x80\x99s website over the weekend.</p> <p>It made for uneasy listening. In attempting to convince Iodice to support the Lega Pro president, Mario Macalli, Lotito presented himself as a man of immense influence within the Italian Football Federation \xe2\x80\x93 the \xe2\x80\x9cdeus ex machina\xe2\x80\x9d of the national game, as more than one newspaper would describe him \xe2\x80\x93 while also diminishing the roles played by others.</p> <p>One of two Serie A club representatives elected to the FIGC\xe2\x80\x99s 23-man federal council last summer, Lotito suggested to Iodice that he was responsible for getting Udinese\xe2\x80\x99s Gino Pozzo chosen alongside him. He also took full credit for Serie A\xe2\x80\x99s most recent TV rights deal, claiming that the league had brought in \xe2\x82\xac1.2bn \xe2\x80\x9cthanks to my skill\xe2\x80\x9d. Meanwhile, he asserted that the decision-making powers of both Macalli and his Serie A counterpart, Maurizio Beretta, amounted to \xe2\x80\x9czero\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Most troubling, though, was the passage in which Lotito seemed to suggest that something should be done to prevent less famous teams from reaching the Italian top-flight. A number of provincial sides are excelling in Serie B this season, with first-placed Carpi playing to average crowds of less than 2,800 people at the tiny Stadio Sandro Cabassi. Lotito apparently does not share the sense of romance that others might feel at seeing an underdog punch so far above its weight.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI said to [the Serie B president Andrea] Abodi, we need to change,\xe2\x80\x9d noted the Lazio owner in his conversation with Iodice. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you bring me up Carpi \xe2\x80\xa6 if you bring me teams that aren\xe2\x80\x99t worth shit, in two or three years we will not have one lira anymore. Because when I go to sell the TV rights \xe2\x80\xa6 in three years\xe2\x80\x99 time if we have Latina, Frosinone, who the fuck will buy the rights? They don\xe2\x80\x99t even know that Frosinone exist.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Lotito\xe2\x80\x99s remarks drew comment everywhere from the newspapers to national government, where the cabinet undersecretary Graziano Delrio called on the FIGC to affect a \xe2\x80\x9cserious and radical change in approach in its management of Italians\xe2\x80\x99 favourite sport\xe2\x80\x9d. The federation responded through a statement from its president, Carlo Tavecchio. \xe2\x80\x9cMovements between divisions are decided by results on the pitch and only those,\xe2\x80\x9d he insisted. \xe2\x80\x9cThere can be, and there are, no calculations of any kind made regarding what is convenient.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Lazio owner, though, was unapologetic. Rather than back away from his comments, he used them as a platform to reiterate his goal to trim Serie A to 18 teams as part of a wide-ranging reform of Italian football. Lotito said he was not trying to stop smaller clubs from succeeding but simply highlighting the need to improve revenue streams. He asserted that the majority of club presidents were behind him.</p> <p>That claim was strengthened when Chievo\xe2\x80\x99s Igor Campedelli and Palermo\xe2\x80\x99s Maurizio Zamparini refused to criticise Lotito, instead chiding Iodice for recording a private phone call. Beretta and Macalli strengthened the Lazio owner\xe2\x80\x99s position when they both agreed with his claims regarding their lack of decision-making powers, each acknowledging that their role is simply to represent the will of the clubs that they represent.</p> <p>Support from within the game was far from universal. The Fiorentina owner, Andrea Della Valle, said that \xe2\x80\x9cLotito\xe2\x80\x99s position within the [FIGC] is no longer sustainable from [my club\xe2\x80\x99s] perspective\xe2\x80\x9d. Juventus\xe2\x80\x99s Marotta likened Italian football\xe2\x80\x99s power structures to a medieval feudal system in which too much authority had been concentrated in the hands of too few people. He added, \xe2\x80\x9cLotito, specifically, is dangerous\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>The most eloquent responses to the Lazio owner, however, were delivered at San Siro, Rome\xe2\x80\x99s Stadio Olimpico and the Dino Manuzzi. Those were the venues where three of Italy\xe2\x80\x99s grandest and most marketable clubs were held by opponents who would be unlikely to feature in Lotito\xe2\x80\x99s ideal vision for a wealthier footballing future.</p> <p>Empoli set the ball rolling when they drew 1-1 away to Milan in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s lunchtime kick-off. The Tuscans could count themselves unfortunate not to have claimed all three points. They had more possession, more shots and completed a markedly higher proportion of their passes. They also very nearly had a goal of the season contender in the ninth minute, when Mario Rui\xe2\x80\x99s effort from the halfway line slipped just wide of the left-hand upright.</p> <p>Parma could not emulate such audacity away to Roma, but they did put in a remarkably unruffled performance to secure a goalless stalemate at a time when they stand on the verge of financial collapse. Taken over for the second time in just over two months, Roberto Donadoni\xe2\x80\x99s team are waiting to see if their new owner, Giampietro Manenti, can live up to his initial promise to pay off outstanding tax bills and wages. Players have threatened to sue the club if they are not paid by the end of Monday.</p> <p>Even without that context Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s resolute display would have represented a drastic shift in fortunes for a Parma team that had previously collected nine points all season. Roma have been going through a difficult spell of their own, and have not won at home in the league since November, but better things were expected with Gervinho returning from the Africa Cup of Nations, plus his Ivory Coast team-mate Seydou Doumbia making his debut up front.</p> <p>Their failure to deliver set the stage for Juventus to go nine points clear at the top. All the Bianconeri had to do was overcome a Cesena side that sat 18th in the table. Instead, they fell behind after a quarter of an hour, recovered to lead 2-1 by the interval and then got pegged back by a Franco Brienza goal in the 70th minute.</p> <p>Juventus were authors of their own demise, their opponents\xe2\x80\x99 first goal arriving after a careless misplaced pass from Andrea Pirlo, before Arturo Vidal missed a chance to restore his team\xe2\x80\x99s advantage from the penalty spot at the very end. But Cesena had shown a greater aggression and willingness to commit men forward than many more established clubs have dared to do when taking on the champions this season.</p> <p>It was also true that the roughly 23,000 fans screaming the house down at a sold-out Manuzzi had made for a far more compelling backdrop than the 27,000 who rattled around San Siro for Milan-Empoli eight hours earlier \xe2\x80\x93 or, indeed, the average crowds of just over 30,000 that Lotito\xe2\x80\x99s Lazio draw at the cavernous Stadio Olimpico. This was a weekend to remind us all that football revolves around more than numbers on a balance sheet.</p> Talking points <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Of course, Lotito could be feeling pretty good about his own Lazio team, after they won 1-0 away to Udinese, care of this cool-as-you-like penalty-spot chip from Antonio Candreva.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Xherdan Shaqiri scored his first Serie A goal, but that was overshadowed by this beauty from Fredy Guar\xc3\xadn as Inter won 4-1 away to Atalanta. (His first wasn\xe2\x80\x99t bad either.) It is tempting to believe Inter might just have turned a corner, given that they have won each of their last two games by a three-goal margin, but as this is the first time that they have put consecutive victories together at all under Roberto Mancini, it is probably safest to hold judgment for a little while yet. This was Inter\xe2\x80\x99s first win in Bergamo since 2008, mind.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 While Milan were labouring to that draw against Empoli, M\xe2\x80\x99Baye Niang was off scoring his first two Serie A goals with Genoa in their 5-2 win over Verona. Any frustration felt by the Rossoneri might be offset at least in part by the knowledge that the Frenchman declined to let Genoa insert an option to buy into his loan contract \xe2\x80\x93 meaning that he should be back at San Siro next season, and quite possibly with a few more goals under his belt.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 A run of six wins in seven league games coming into this weekend was enough to get some commentators wondering whether Napoli might yet find a way back into the title race. An emphatic 3-1 defeat away to Palermo will probably quieten such talk. But if nothing else, Rafa Ben\xc3\xadtez\xe2\x80\x99s team can take consolation from knowing that their January signing of Manolo Gabbiadini (three goals in his last four games \xe2\x80\x93 only two of which were starts) has crushed any chance of Sampdoria catching them in third.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Fiorentina have come nicely into form ahead of their Europa League clash with Tottenham. Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s 3-1 win over Sassuolo extended their unbeaten run in all competitions to eight games \xe2\x80\x93 six of which have been victories. Oh, and Mohamed Salah got a goal and an assist on his first start after joining from Chelsea.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Brit-watch: Both Micah Richards and Ashley Cole made their first league starts since November. The Fiorentina player benefitted from Vincenzo Montella\xe2\x80\x99s reversion to a four-man defence against Sassuolo, doing a solid job getting up and down the flank from right-back. Cole came as close as anybody to breaking the deadlock for Roma, when his header hit the post late in the second-half.</p> <p>Results: Atalanta 1-4 Inter, Cesena 2-2 Juventus, Chievo 2-1 Sampdoria, Genoa 5-2 Verona, Milan 1-1 Empoli, Palermo 3-1 Napoli, Roma 0-0 Parma, Sassuolo 1-3 Fiorentina, Torino 1-1 Cagliari, Udinese 0-1 Lazio</p>'
