b'Sunderland v Chelsea: match preview'


b'<p>Sunderland may appear in peril of reprising last season\xe2\x80\x99s relegation skirmish but at least Gus Poyet knows how to beat Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho. As a former Chelsea player, Poyet relished choreographing a 2-1 win at Stamford Bridge in April which ended Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s run of 77 undefeated home Premier League games during his two stints in charge in west London. As if that was not enough, Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s players also knocked Chelsea out of last season\xe2\x80\x99s League Cup. Can lightning strike thrice? \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m hoping for an ugly evening with lots of wind and rain,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.
