b'Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Alex Scott aims high for Women\xe2\x80\x99s Super League and World Cup'


b'<p>Alex Scott is talking about momentum. More specifically she is discussing the forces propelling women\xe2\x80\x99s football into the spotlight like never before.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMomentum\xe2\x80\x99s such a big thing and this year\xe2\x80\x99s massive for our game,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Arsenal and England right-back on the eve of the FA Women\xe2\x80\x99s Super League season. If England\xe2\x80\x99s domestic divisions have never been stronger, the national side are preparing for June\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup in Canada on a considerable high while Arsenal have imported a leading Spanish coach in Pedro Mart\xc3\xadnez Losa.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so excited about this season, I feel it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the best yet,\xe2\x80\x9d Scott says. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery WSL team has star players, exciting players, players people are going to want to watch. And another great thing is there\xe2\x80\x99s such parity between the eight sides, everybody\xe2\x80\x99s strong, everybody can beat each other, which was something we saw last season when the title could have gone to any of three teams on the final day.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In the end Liverpool were the ones left celebrating in October, leaving Arsenal languishing in an unaccustomed fourth position following a campaign featuring an unusual degree of behind the scenes turmoil.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good enough for Arsenal,\xe2\x80\x9d she concedes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re an Arsenal player you expect to be winning the title every year but we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a new manager, Pedro, who knows where Arsenal need to be. Pedro worked in America before joining us at the end of last season and his ideas are so exciting, he\xe2\x80\x99s also brought in some very good new players.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>They include the Spain striker, Natalia Pablos Sanch\xc3\xb3n, who arrives from Bristol Academy and Vicky Losada, a creative import from Barcelona. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I first saw her [Losada] in training I thought \xe2\x80\x98wow\xe2\x80\x99, she\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly skilful,\xe2\x80\x9d Scott says. \xe2\x80\x9cFans are going to love watching her.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Alex Scott    <p>Even so the emergence of Manchester City and Chelsea means the league\xe2\x80\x99s topography has changed almost beyond recognition with the once mighty Arsenal no longer dominant. Certainly Birmingham, Bristol Academy, Notts County and promoted Sunderland are not intending to merely make up the numbers in the top division of the two-tier WSL. \xe2\x80\x9cNotts County especially have made some really good signings,\xe2\x80\x9d says Scott.</p> <p>The hike in overall quality and fitness reflects the game\xe2\x80\x99s steady shift from strictly amateur status towards professionalism. Although most WSL players have part-time jobs, some are fully professional and on contracts worth in excess of \xc2\xa320,000 a year.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe standard\xe2\x80\x99s so much higher than a few years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d says Scott who, in 2009 crossed the Atlantic for a two-year professional stint with Boston Breakers. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople assume I went for the money but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that, it was so I could improve in a way that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t possible here. Now though you can develop your game by staying in England, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to go to America or Sweden any more.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The league kicks off with Liverpool v Sunderland on Wednesday and the women\xe2\x80\x99s game has begun to enjoy a little of the publicity it has long struggled to command. If London 2012 proved a watershed \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cthe Olympics were massive for women\xe2\x80\x99s football in this country,\xe2\x80\x9d Scott says \xe2\x80\x93 the 45,000strong crowd who saw England lose to Germany at Wembley last year spoke volumes.</p> <p>If a further milestone was reached last October when Steph Houghton, the Manchester City and England captain, adorned the front of Shoot magazine, June\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup presents another opportunity to win hearts and minds. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to increase interest in the WSL,\xe2\x80\x9d says Scott, who has done her bit to accelerate this quiet revolution by founding a football academy for teenage girls in Kingston, south-west London, while writing frequent articles on the women\xe2\x80\x99s game in her free time.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPeople watching us for the first time are amazed at how technical, how fast, the women\xe2\x80\x99s game is now,\xe2\x80\x9d says the 30-year-old who \xe2\x80\x9cprefers writing to coaching\xe2\x80\x9d. As part of the England squad who have just won the Cyprus Cup, Scott feels a national side managed by Mark Sampson \xe2\x80\x93 once a coach under Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez at Swansea City \xe2\x80\x93 are gaining momentum at precisely the right time.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMark\xe2\x80\x99s got a fantastic outlook on football and life,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s one of those people you really want to do well for. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same with Pedro at Arsenal.\xe2\x80\x9d Her \xe2\x80\x9cbest season yet\xe2\x80\x9d might just be about to unfold.</p> <p>The FA Women\xe2\x80\x99s Super League is exclusively live on BT Sport and kicks off with Liverpool v Sunderland on Wednesday (BT Sport 1 from 7.30pm) </p>'
