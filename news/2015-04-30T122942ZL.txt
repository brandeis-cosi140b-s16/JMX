b'<p>Jon Flanagan has suffered another setback in his attempt to reclaim a first-team place at Liverpool after being ruled out for at least six months following knee surgery.</p> <p>The 22-year-old has not featured once for Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 side this term having damaged a knee during pre-season. He returned to full training last month after two previous knee operations, and featured in the recent Liverpool All-Stars charity game at Anfield, but underwent a third procedure in London on Tuesday after scans had revealed a problem in his recovery.</p> <p>Flanagan, an influential part of Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s title challenge in the second half of last season, is expected to be sidelined for between six and nine months as a result. It could be next year before the full-back is ready to challenge for a first-team role again should he require nine months to return to full fitness.</p> <p>The latest injury setback could not have come at a worse time for Flanagan, who is out of contract at Anfield this summer and has been involved in protracted negotiations over a new deal with his boyhood club. Rodgers had stated previously, however, that Flanagan has a long-term future at Liverpool and the club opted for the latest operation to ensure a full recovery from the persistent knee trouble.</p>'
