b"Granny Fiver's tender sprouts"


b'<p>NO HO HO</p> <p>Christmas is always a big event at Fiver Towers. The festivities usually begin sometime in mid-June, when the John Lewis advert comes out and turns the Fiver into such a blubbering, incoherent, sentimental mess that a comprehensive course of sedatives is administered by concerned medical professionals. The Fiver comes down from its woozy high in mid-November, at which point Granny Fiver puts the sprouts on. Then it\xe2\x80\x99s the big day: presents; exchange of receipts for presents; morning pints of Board Game Argument Instigator; Queen\xe2\x80\x99s speech; complaints about consistency of sprouts; Doctor Who; visit of police and confiscation of Cluedo board; and finally bed, or blackout, whichever comes first. Then it\xe2\x80\x99s turkey sandwiches until May. Ho ho ho! It\xe2\x80\x99s the same every year, always has been, always will be.</p> <p>Or so we thought. For this grand tradition looks like coming to an enforced end in 2022. That\xe2\x80\x99s because a Fifa taskforce has come to the conclusion that the World Cup in Qatar should take place in November and December, when players and fans are much less likely to become fatally paggered by heat, with the final played two days before Christmas. \xe2\x80\x9cBlah blah blah careful consideration of the various options blah blah blah best solution blah drone blah thank all members of the football community for their productive input,\xe2\x80\x9d chuntered taskforce chief Sheikh Salman bin Ebrahim al-Khalifa, who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t much care what you think, but to be fair which football administrator has ever done that. \xe2\x80\x9cBlah blether drone blah.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Sheikh Salman has hatched this little scheme with a view to not only avoiding Qatar\xe2\x80\x99s stupefying 40-degree May-to-September sun, but also bodyswerving the Winter Olympics in January and February, and Ramadan in April. Not a thought on how or when to find the time for England\xe2\x80\x99s traditional festive programme, Granny Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s tender sprouts, or the Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s thundering prescription drug habit, but admittedly those concerns are perhaps slightly parochial. Still, there were plenty of other countries also hoping that Qatar would be stripped of the tournament in favour of someone who could stage it in the summer as usual, without everyone keeling over from Temperature Pagger. But since Sheikh Salman\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations will almost certainly be ratified next month by the Fifa executive committee, and backed by Uefa if not necessarily all of its members, the deal looks sealed. The 2022 World Cup is finally on, while Christmas (June 2022 to May 2023) is off! Though it should be noted that the anti-Qatar lobby has one last hope: that Fifa bigwig and bon vivant Sepp Blatter realises there\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing as halal foie gras, and panics accordingly.</p> LIVE BIG CUP ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT! <p>Follow Manchester City 1-2 Barcelona with Jacob Steinberg and Juventus 2-2 Borussia Dortmund with Scott Murray from 7.45pm GMT. </p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking to get back in next season. The off-season comes and then I\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking to work somewhere because I love it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing else in my life really. I\xe2\x80\x99m useless around the house\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Harry Redknapp warns risk-taking chairmen of aspirational mid-budget teams that he still has much more damage to do.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPeter Snowden\xe2\x80\x99s reminiscing about Ian Ormondroyd\xe2\x80\x99s in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver made me recall a moment from my youth. Whilst playing for Harborough Town Juniors (a Leicestershire-based team, and probably around the under-10s, or so) we were visited by a team touring from Chernobyl, as part of a charity offering after the disaster there. As part of the day, proceedings were graced by the presence of Mr Ormondroyd, who was accompanied by Kevin Poole \xe2\x80\x93 then the Leicester City No9 and No1, respectively. Short shorts, short goalkeepers, and lanky strikers \xe2\x80\xa6 cue warm, fuzzy memories of the early-90s, and the hysteria of a kit made by Fox Leisure\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Kyle Barber.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI noticed in Friday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver that Mr McCourt referenced his \xe2\x80\x98friend and family\xe2\x80\x99. I was heartened to read that there is someone else out there who only has one person that they can call a friend. When I read of his love for Ocean Colour Scene and his penchant for elephant trampling, I was left in no doubt that we would be great together (as friends). Please pass on my offer of friendship and will be glad to see Mr McCourt refer to his amigos in plural next time around. P.S. Non-response will be taken as acceptance\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Barry Gilley (and no others).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
