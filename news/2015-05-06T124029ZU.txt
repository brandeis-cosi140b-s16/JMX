b'Uefa must show more flexibility towards Europa League to restore past glories | Paul Wilson'


b'<p>Here is a quick quiz question. What, apart from winning the European Cup, do the following managers have in common: Bob Paisley, Giovanni Trapattoni, Louis van Gaal, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho and Rafa Ben\xc3\xadtez? Answer: they all won the Uefa Cup first.</p> <p>Add in a few other names, such as Sven-G\xc3\xb6ran Eriksson, Franz Beckenbauer and Diego Simeone, who either put themselves on the managerial map with Uefa Cup success, or cut their teeth in European competition in the tournament, and it can be seen that the lesser of Uefa\xe2\x80\x99s two tournaments fulfils a useful function in preparing Champions League contenders of the future.</p> <p>Or rather it used to perform that function. Of the above managers, only Simeone won the competition in its guise as the Europa League. In its new format the old Uefa Cup requires a certain stamina to stick through the interminable groups and the disruptive effect of playing on Thursdays and Sundays. By the time the Europa League reaches the semi-final stage it is almost as glamorous and prestigious as the senior competition, especially with the carrot of Champions League entry waiting as a prize for the winner. Yet, without wishing to detract from the achievements of Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk, Fiorentina, Napoli and Sevilla in reaching this week\xe2\x80\x99s last four, it is a slog that has far from universal appeal.</p> <p>English clubs all too predictably fell by the wayside early in the knockout stages this season and while that may have been simply down to bad luck, there has already been suggestions that potential Premier League qualifiers for next season\xe2\x80\x99s Europa League \xe2\x80\x93 Liverpool, Tottenham and Southampton \xe2\x80\x93 have been juggling their results with a view to just missing out. That is actually quite difficult to do, especially if, like Liverpool, you still have a faint hope of a top-four finish. But there could be no mistaking the indifference towards the competition in remarks made recently by some of the managers involved.</p> <p>Brendan Rodgers has said that he would use the Europa League as an occasion to give the kids an outing should Liverpool qualify next season. One can easily understand that: it means the first team will still be fresh for the weekend even if the actual players from the Europa games arrived home from eastern Europe at some ungodly hour on a Friday morning. Also, if Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s priority is Champions League qualification, then a decent run at the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s top four is a far more sensible alternative than hoping for the luck of the draw in Europe. Yet if the Uefa Cup was the first European trophy Bill Shankly and (separately) Paisley brought back to Anfield, why should Rodgers be so dismissive of its latest incarnation?</p> <p>With nothing yet on the sideboard after three seasons at the club, one might have imagined that Rodgers would be desperate to get his hands on any trophy, particularly one that comes with a pass into the Champions League, though to judge by the muted reaction to his comments about using youth players it appears there is general agreement that the Europa League is the hardest one of all to target.</p> <p>Mauricio Pochettino admitted as much last season when still in charge of Southampton. He said the Europa League, if taken seriously, would \xe2\x80\x9ckill\xe2\x80\x9d a team\xe2\x80\x99s domestic challenge, implying that only mid-table sides with few other cares in the world could afford to concentrate on Thursday nights instead of the weekend results once back at home. \xe2\x80\x9cYou find you lose ground in your own league and struggle all season to make it up,\xe2\x80\x9d Pochettino said. Having moved to Spurs over the summer, he gave this season\xe2\x80\x99s competition a decent shot, taking the group stage seriously before losing out to Fiorentina over two legs. But he is already warning that next season may be different. The priority has to be a top-four finish, Pochettino has said, indicating once again that the Europa League is a distraction ambitious clubs do not need.</p> <p>Most people in this country would agree with that, though not necessarily in other leagues around Europe. Sevilla, for instance, have made the Europa League something of a speciality in recent seasons. They finished fifth in La Liga last season but 27 points off the top and never entertained any serious hope of cracking the top three. Bilbao, who beat them to fourth place, did so by a seven-point margin.</p> <p>In Italy, where two Serie A teams are represented in the Europa League last four, Napoli and Fiorentina finished third and fourth respectively, the former losing to Athletic Bilbao in a Champions League qualifying play-off. Yet though fourth place in Italy sounds quite good, in reality Fiorentina were nowhere. Their total of 65 points last season was a massive 37 short of Juventus\xe2\x80\x99s admittedly exceptional 102. Napoli, in third, were 24 points off the pace and a similar picture has emerged this season. Lazio have squeezed into third place, Italy\xe2\x80\x99s last Champions League slot, leaving Napoli and Fiorentina in fourth and fifth, 20 and 27 points respectively off the top.</p> <p>So the question has to be, given the extended nature of the Europa League and the greater competitiveness within the Premier League, will an English team ever lift the Uefa/Europa trophy again? Ben\xc3\xadtez did it in somewhat unusual circumstances a couple of years ago but before that the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s best shots, significantly perhaps, were from Fulham and Middlesbrough. Is the Premier League as competitive as all that? Well, it has four Champions League places, for a start, and perhaps six or seven credible contenders each season. It also has three relegations spots and around 10 teams are normally worried until the last couple of months.</p> <p>Everton played in the Europa League this season amid growing concern over their league position, while last season Wigan Athletic could reasonably argue their European commitments cost them their best chance of promotion back from the Championship.</p> <p>There may well be no way around this, though you cannot help but feel the Thursday night aspect to Europa League football is the most off-putting for English clubs. To give one obvious example, Liverpool had to return from playing Besiktas in Turkey on a Thursday night in February, where they played extra time and lost on penalties, to face Manchester City on the Sunday at noon on the Sunday. That was mostly television\xe2\x80\x99s fault, though nonetheless ludicrous, even if Liverpool somehow managed to beat City.</p> <p>The fact that Europa ties have to be played on Thursday is also television\xe2\x80\x99s fault because Uefa will not tolerate any competition to its lucrative Champions League broadcast slots and sponsors. Yet playing on Thursdays and Sundays for much of the season is unwieldy and unattractive and demeans what used to be a popular, prestigious competition. Surely some sort of flexibility or compromise is possible? Given that many of the Thursday ties kick off at 6pm anyway, why not play at those times on Tuesdays and Wednesdays?</p> <p>Or why not, just occasionally, put Europa games on at the same time as Champions League games, on the understanding that only later can they be televised? If weekends are for football, then it follows, as night follows day, that Thursday is a highly inconvenient night to play European ties. Something inevitably has to give and at the moment it appears to be English interest in competing properly in the Europa League. Uefa has probably noticed that. Whether it considers it a problem is another matter.</p>'
