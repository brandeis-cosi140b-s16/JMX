b'Everton feel the heat as Kevin Mirallas\xe2\x80\x99s mutiny adds unwanted problem'


b'<p>Everton fly to Qatar on Wednesday and, contrary to rumours, Kevin Mirallas has not insisted on piloting the plane. Warm-weather training is the official reason for the trip but they are also searching for answers for how a season of high but attainable ambition has disintegrated into a fractious relegation contest.</p> <p>Mirallas will travel despite being a) injured; b) in search of a transfer; c) despicably in breach of team orders; or d) one of Everton\xe2\x80\x99s few in-form players, who took a penalty against West Bromwich Albion on Monday but missed. Delete as appropriate.</p> <p>What is known following the otherwise drab goalless draw against Tony Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s team is that Mirallas was not involved in a bust-up inside the dressing room at half-time or hauled off as punishment by Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez, although Everton\xe2\x80\x99s players are angry with the Belgium international for taking the penalty instead of the designated taker, Leighton Baines.</p> <p>Both Baines and Phil Jagielka, the captain who did not intervene in the dispute, have been criticised for allowing Mirallas to proceed with the 44th-minute penalty but the winger shoulders responsibility. The miss was compounded by doubts over Mirallas\xe2\x80\x99s future at Goodison Park, with Tottenham Hotspur among the interested parties, as well as his failure to reappear for the second half and Everton\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent inability to create a chance of note in the second half.</p> <p>Mart\xc3\xadnez could not castigate Mirallas in public afterwards for the simple reason that the 27-year-old represents the one functioning creative talent in a team desperately short of creativity. A recurrence of a persistent hamstring problem was the manager\xe2\x80\x99s explanation for Mirallas\xe2\x80\x99s replacement by Bryan Oviedo at the interval.</p> <p>Monday provided the latest example of Everton\xe2\x80\x99s lack of imagination, urgency or aggression to punish an opponent content to sit back and let Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s team play in front of them, confident that little danger will materialise in behind. But it also signalled a worrying change for the Everton manager.</p> <p>Frustration at laboured, harmless passing has been simmering at Goodison throughout the season but it boiled over when Muhamed Besic was substituted in the 79th minute. Cheers for the introduction of an extra striker in Arouna Kon\xc3\xa9 gave way to fierce condemnation of Mart\xc3\xadnez when the Bosnian\xe2\x80\x99s number appeared on the board. Another injury explanation was provided by the manager post-match but did not tally with Besic\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to being replaced. \xe2\x80\x9cIt did surprise me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mart\xc3\xadnez of the widespread boos. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I can understand the frustration around the crowd as well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Besic\xe2\x80\x99s departure was also a signal for the crowd to lose patience with Ross Barkley who, along with Gareth Barry, had delivered a more convincing case for substitution. Barkley again found himself in the invidious position of trying to rescue another poor performance by his boyhood club but succeeded only in magnifying his mistakes and erratic decision-making.</p> <p>Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s recently admitted that he has been \xe2\x80\x9cbombarding Ross with information to grow quickly\xe2\x80\x9d, but it appears to have reached overload. The 21-year-old missed the first two months of the season through injury but needs the break in Qatar more than anyone.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a chance to go away and take a bit of time to take a step back and look at where we are going wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said Baines. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to because we are going wrong at the minute. This will give us more time together to try and put things right. It gives us the chance to put more work in and cover some more points that we need to go over and address. Hopefully we can get more spirit back amongst the lads and keep everyone together. It is difficult at the moment. We have to stay together and look after each other. Hopefully this trip can be beneficial in all those ways.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mirallas\xe2\x80\x99s penalty miss will assume greater significance should Everton\xe2\x80\x99s malaise continue on their return from the Middle East. A looming fixture list of Crystal Palace away, Liverpool and Chelsea does not bode well for a team on a run of one win in 13 matches.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to take this opportunity to go for some warm-weather training and reset ourselves for the second half of the season,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Mart\xc3\xadnez.</p> <p>The second half of the season commenced three games ago.</p>'
