b'<p>Eden Hazard has been named the Professional Footballers\xe2\x80\x99 Association player of the year for 2014-15, recognising a season of performances that have helped bring Chelsea to the verge of the Premier League title.</p> <p>The 24-year-old, who won the young player of the year award last year and has built on that achievement with some impeccable displays this time around, took the prize ahead of second-placed Harry Kane and third-placed David de Gea. A few hours before the ceremony at Grosvenor House in London, Hazard had made his 33rd league start in as many games at Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Emirates Stadium, where his side secured a draw that took them 10 points clear at the top with five games left.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very happy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hazard. \xe2\x80\x9cOne day I want to be the best and what I did this season is play very well, Chelsea played very well. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I deserve to win but it is good for me.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is good, it is better to be voted by the players \xe2\x80\x93 they know everything about football. This is good. I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Hazard, a Belgium international, arrived at Stamford Bridge from Ligue 1 side Lille in June 2012 as a much-heralded wunderkind and has matured into one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s best attacking players. He has scored 18 goals in all competitions this season and was praised by his manager Jose Mourinho last week as \xe2\x80\x9cA fantastic boy. A golden boy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI continue like I did last season \xe2\x80\x93 I try to be the same,\xe2\x80\x9d added Hazard. \xe2\x80\x9cI try to score more goals than last season [when he scored 17]. Personally I have played a good season, I have been there in the big games and I scored a lot of important goals, this is why I\xe2\x80\x99m better this season.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cJose [Mourinho] lets me play, we talk together sometimes and when I\xe2\x80\x99m on the pitch I know what I have to do \xe2\x80\x93 this is most important. We are almost there to win the league.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Winner of the PFA\xe2\x80\x99s Young Player of the Year, Harry Kane.

It came as little surprise after a season in which the 21-year-old striker has scored 30 goals for Tottenham Hotspur \xe2\x80\x93 20 of them in the Premier League. He described his campaign as \xe2\x80\x9cunreal\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Kane, who also scored on his England debut in March within 79 seconds of entering the pitch against Lithuania, had been named alongside Hazard in the PFA Team of the Year earlier on Sunday. Five other Chelsea players also made the XI and were joined by De Gea, Ryan Bertrand, Coutinho and Alexis Sanchez.</p> <p>Ji So-yun made it a clean sweep for Chelsea in the senior awards, being named PFA women\xe2\x80\x99s player of the year. The South Korean midfielder has been instrumental for the current Women\xe2\x80\x99s Super League leaders since joining the club last year. Leah Williamson, the 18-year-old Arsenal midfielder and England Under-23 international, took the women\xe2\x80\x99s young player of the year title.</p> <p>There was also acknowledgement for two long-term servants to the men\xe2\x80\x99s game who will both leave the Premier League for Major League Soccer this summer. Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard shared the PFA Merit Award \xe2\x80\x93 with Lampard, who partnered Gerrard in the England midfield for a decade, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a great honour to be alongside a player who himself has done so much for the game. For the two of us to get it, it is a nice send-off and a nice ending for me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
