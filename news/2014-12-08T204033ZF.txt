b'FA Cup third round draw: AFC Wimbledon drawn against Liverpool'


b'<p>An evocative, memory provoking FA Cup third round takes Liverpool to Kingsmeadow, the home of AFC Wimbledon in early January. It is the first time in their 12-year history that Neal Ardley\xe2\x80\x99s League Two side have reached this stage and they have secured a tie bound to recall 1988 and the original Wimbledon\xe2\x80\x99s famous 1-0 FA Cup final victory over Liverpool courtesy of Lawrie Sanchez\xe2\x80\x99s looping header.</p> <p>Much more recently Arsenal beat Hull in last season\xe2\x80\x99s final, recovering from being two goals down to win 3-2 thanks to Aaron Ramsey\xe2\x80\x99s extra-time winner. and In an uncanny piece of symmetry, the pair meet again at Emirates Stadium. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s hope it\xe2\x80\x99s as good a game as the final,\xe2\x80\x9d said Steve Bruce, the Hull manager, who was startled to learn that his and Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s teams had also been paired in the rehearsal for last night\xe2\x80\x99s televised draw. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite remarkable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruce. \xe2\x80\x9cFor it to happen again is amazing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As the lowest-ranked surviving side in this season\xe2\x80\x99s competition Blyth Spartans of the Northern Premier League had been hoping for Premier League opposition. Instead they got Championship Birmingham City who must visit their Croft Park home on the Northumberland coast. \xe2\x80\x9cBirmingham are a good side,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tom Wade, Blyth\xe2\x80\x99s manager. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a chance at Croft Park.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Their north-east neighbours, Gateshead did land a trip to Premier League West Brom while Dover, also of the Conference, will be delighted by the prospect of entertaining another top-flight club, Crystal Palace, on the Kent coast.</p> <p>Two more Conference rivals should be similarly pleased with their destinations. While Wrexham face an interesting trip to Premier League Stoke City, whose manager Mark Hughes is from the Welsh town and grew up supporting Wrexham, Southport visit Steve McClaren\xe2\x80\x99s Championship topping Derby County. Gary Brabin\xe2\x80\x99s side may be only 20th in their division but says he is looking forward to a tactical duel with a former England coach. \xe2\x80\x9cDerby are riding high and Steve McClaren has organised them well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Southport\xe2\x80\x99s manager. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we can give them a good game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>If Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Leeds United at the Stadium of Light immediately recalls a May afternoon at Wembley in 1973 when Jim Montgomery\xe2\x80\x99s double save and Ian Porterfield\xe2\x80\x99s decisive goal ensured Bob Stokoe\xe2\x80\x99s Sunderland shocked then all-conquering Leeds United, Manchester United have a less glamorous tie in store. Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s introduction to the FA Cup involves an excursion to either Accrington Stanley or Yeovil who must replay their second round tie but Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s Chelsea should be reasonably happy with the short journey to Championship Watford.</p>'
