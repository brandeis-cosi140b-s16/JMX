b'<p>And then there was one. Chelsea and Bristol City started the day as the only unbeaten sides in the top five tiers of English football. The only sides capable of joining The Invincibles \xe2\x80\x93 Preston North End, in the 1888-89 season, and Arsenal, in 2003-04.</p> <p>At the end of the day, only Chelsea remained. City lost to a late goal in an often feisty West Country derby with Swindon Town and their chance of immortality had gone.</p> <p>Mind you, had they avoided defeat at the County Ground, they would still have had another 29 games to safely negotiate. That would have been unlikely.</p> <p>As it was, City\xe2\x80\x99s loss was tinged with not regret but bitterness and controversy \xe2\x80\x93 at the fact of having to play for 87 minutes, plus stoppage time, with only ten men.</p> <p>Even the real Invincibles might not have managed to survive that.</p> <p>The City captain, Wade Elliott, saw red in only the third minute when he tangled with Swindon\xe2\x80\x99s midfielder Jack Stephens. After exchanging sly digs, Elliott appeared to flick his head backwards into the face of Stephens, who fell to the floor.</p> <p>As Stephens received treatment, the referee, Darren Drysdale, took advice from Lee Swabey, his assistant, and dismissed Elliott.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe sending off was an absolute disgrace,\xe2\x80\x9d the City manager, Steve Cotterill, said. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it but I\xe2\x80\x99ve looked at it four times on a laptop. Stephens pulls back Wade by the shoulders. We will appeal 100%. We have to.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut that [incident] probably only enhanced what I already knew about my players. After our first defeat, I can speak only positively about them.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey are a real honest bunch of lads, I\xe2\x80\x99m really proud of them. I know they\xe2\x80\x99re hurting and they just feel that they\xe2\x80\x99ve suffered a big injustice. Wade certainly feels that way.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As natural in many a derby dust-up, the rival manager viewed it differently. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen the sending off yet,\xe2\x80\x9d Swindon\xe2\x80\x99s Mark Cooper said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut my players said it was a backwards head-butt.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Butt or not, the Elliott-Stephens confrontation ignited the flames\xe2\x80\x93 and a couple of smoke bombs were thrown on to the pitch from the Stratton Bank stand, which housed the City fans.</p> <p>Once the red mist and smoke had cleared, a game emerged. Not in the first half, as City adjusted to their numerical disadvantage, but certainly after the interval.</p> <p>The League One leaders City were actually boasting a 22-match undefeated League One sequence \xe2\x80\x93 going back to last season \xe2\x80\x93 and were doing their damnedest to protect it.</p> <p>But Swindon, with an average age of just under 22, showed youthful exuberance in abundance. Nathan Byrne thumped a 25-yarder on to the crossbar and the City keeper Frank Fielding saved superbly from a Stephens piledriver.</p> <p>With 12 minutes remaining, the dam broke. Michael Smith went on a slaloming, mesmerising run deep inside the City area before poking the ball home past Fielding for his 12th goal of the season to seal a win that lifted them to second place.</p> <p>And that was that. City\xe2\x80\x99s aura of invincibility was over. Chelsea now have a clear run to share the glory with Preston and Arsenal.</p>'
