b'Frank Lampard\xe2\x80\x99s enduring excellence makes Manchester City stay a formality | Jamie Jackson'


b'<p>To stand only one goal behind Thierry Henry in the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s all-time scoring charts is a measure of Frank Lampard\xe2\x80\x99s supreme talent. To score as many in all competitions as Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 this season \xe2\x80\x93 five \xe2\x80\x93 with far less game-time is another. And to have the best top-flight strike rate of a goal every 68 minutes, to lead Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero (81) and Diego Costa (83), when a midfielder by trade is one more.</p> <p>Yet perhaps the best indicator of Lampard\xe2\x80\x99s enduring excellence is that these achievements all derive from a man in a 37th year, one whose relentless drive took him to 174 league goals on Sunday at Southampton and whose overhauling of Henry\xe2\x80\x99s 175 for Arsenal seems almost inevitable.</p> <p>Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s loan acquisition from New York City FC of a player deemed too old by Chelsea already appears inspired. Lampard cannot stop scoring and cannot stop being a factor for the defending champions. He stood on four goals in 10 City appearances when coming on as a 65th-minute replacement for Samir Nasri at St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s.</p> <p>From the moment he glided on to the ball a quarter of an hour later, taking possession on the edge of Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s area, there seemed little doubt that Saints were about to go 2-0 behind and City would be swapping places with Ronald Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s side to return to the north-west in second place, only six points behind Chelsea. \xe2\x80\x9cAs he\xe2\x80\x99s shooting, you know it\xe2\x80\x99s a goal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jamie Carragher on Sky Sports. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just Frank Lampard. There\xe2\x80\x99s probably no one better we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the past 10 or 20 years in terms of that position coming on to a ball. I think he\xe2\x80\x99s only one Premier League goal behind Thierry Henry and that\xe2\x80\x99s an unbelievable stat for a central midfield player.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Suddenly the title race is back on and the decision to have Lampard\xe2\x80\x99s City stay extended beyond January can be filed under \xe2\x80\x9cno-brainer\xe2\x80\x9d. With New York City\xe2\x80\x99s status as the reigning champions\xe2\x80\x99 sister club, any deal to keep him until the Major League Soccer season starts in mid-March is a formality.</p> <p>With Tour\xc3\xa9 away at the Africa Cup of Nations from early January until 8 February, if Ivory Coast were to reach the final, then Lampard could even be retained until May.</p> <p>The prospect has previously been described as \xe2\x80\x9cnot impossible\xe2\x80\x9d by Manuel Pellegrini, and it is thought there is a clause in Lampard\xe2\x80\x99s contract that will allow City to keep him should the Chilean wish. How much of a dent this would put in the credibility of New York, a start-up franchise about to embark on a maiden season, and the MLS, if a marquee player is shown to have effectively been farmed to City from there may cause debate. But there would be surprise if this proves a deal-breaker.</p> <p>Whether City are still in the Champions League next year is one factor being weighed in how long to retain Lampard. After next Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s final Group E game with Roma City\xe2\x80\x99s fate will be known, so the decision may be taken then regarding precisely how long he stays at the Etihad Stadium.</p> <p>Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s team travel to the Italian capital, level on five points with Roma and CSKA Moscow, knowing that defeat means they are out of the competition and of the Europa League.</p> <p>While this would mean a reduction in games, even with no European football there is a strong case for Pellegrini keeping Lampard on until the end of the season for the domestic battles of defending the title and the FA Cup, which starts next month.</p> <p>Thus far Lampard has been diplomatic in public. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99m not looking that far ahead,\xe2\x80\x9d he has said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nice that they\xe2\x80\x99re saying that. It\xe2\x80\x99s better that they\xe2\x80\x99re saying that than they can\xe2\x80\x99t wait for me to go but we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what happens.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Privately, though, he must be keen to prolong his time at City for as long as possible. As a player who continues to keep the best of professional standards why would he wish to go into a kind of semi-retirement and play in the MLS, which is a minor league in all but name?</p> <p>As Pablo Zabaleta says: \xe2\x80\x9cFor me what makes Frank Lampard special is how professional he is in training \xe2\x80\x93 this is what I appreciate from him. He is always the first to arrive on the training ground and the last to go home. He won everything with Chelsea, he\xe2\x80\x99s a legend in football and he\xe2\x80\x99s still playing like he\xe2\x80\x99s 18 years old.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As Pellegrini takes his team to Sunderland for Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s match he says: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Lampard came I expected him to be the same player he has been for his whole career. His quality is the same.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>These are words Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho must hope do not continue to be supported by action in the fight for the championship. On 31 January Chelsea entertain City at Stamford Bridge in an encounter that could have a defining influence on who takes the title this season.</p> <p>Mourinho was not overly pleased when Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s travelling support cheered Lampard when he came on against their team at the Etihad in September and the manager\xe2\x80\x99s mood darkened further when you-know-who grabbed the 85th-minute equaliser.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen he decided to go to a direct competitor to Chelsea, then love stories are over,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho afterwards. \xe2\x80\x9cHe did his job as a professional.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Do not be surprised if Lampard scores once more against his old club, next month. And continues to be a force for Manchester City until well into the spring at least.</p>'
