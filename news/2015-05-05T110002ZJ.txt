b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho to hold talks with Chelsea over extending contract to 2019'


b"<p>Chelsea are to hold talks with Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s representative aimed at extending the manager\xe2\x80\x99s second spell at Stamford Bridge by a further two years.</p> <p>Mourinho signed a four-year deal worth around \xc2\xa310m-a-season in the summer of 2013 to return to the club having repaired his relationship with the owner, Roman Abramovich, following the tempestuous end to his first period in charge.</p> <p>He did not win a trophy last season but, having maintained the side\xe2\x80\x99s development over those first 12 months, will end this campaign having secured Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s first Premier League title in five years plus the Capital One Cup.</p>  <p> Related: Chelsea's Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas says Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho's edge makes him the best </p>   <p>The club had always intended to extend his contract but had been waiting for the pursuit of the Premier League to be resolved, anxious as they were for negotiations not to prove a distraction.</p> <p>Discussions with Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s agent, Jorge Mendes, should be straightforward with the manager having already made it clear he wants to stay. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not here thinking about my next move because I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have a next move,\xe2\x80\x9d he said earlier this year. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m here to stay. I belong to Chelsea, Chelsea belong to me. I gave a lot to Chelsea in the past but they also gave a lot to me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Those comments maintained a theme first aired last season, when the 52-year-old had set himself the target of remaining Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s manager for another 12 years before a potential spell in charge of Portugal. His first spell at the club was curtailed after a little over three years when relations with Abramovich became strained.</p> <p>Mourinho returned in 2013 keen to embrace the new kind of project on offer at Stamford Bridge \xe2\x80\x93 that of a club keen to operate within the restrictions of financial fair play regulations \xe2\x80\x93 and has thrived.</p> <p>The hierarchy have backed him consistently, not least in his regular disputes with the Football Association and match officials, with that faith repaid by the management. \xe2\x80\x9cI stay here until Mr Abramovich wants me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho after Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s victory over Crystal Palace won the title. \xe2\x80\x9cThe day he tells me to go, I go. He is the man who won every title at Chelsea \xe2\x80\x93 some players won some, some different managers won others, but Mr Abramovich won them all. If he has replicas made [of all the trophies the side have claimed], he will need a big house.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho, whose extended deal would run to 2019, and his players will return to training at Cobham on Thursday before Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s visit of Liverpool. The squad were given a few days off following their title triumph.</p>"
