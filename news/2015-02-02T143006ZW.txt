b'Why the January transfer window should be abolished'


b'<p>If you believe in pseudoscientific nonsense, you might think that Blue Monday - the third Monday in January \xe2\x80\x93 is the most depressing day of the year. If you are a football fan, you might want to push that date back a fortnight. Surely there is nothing more annoying than the January transfer deadline day, that gaudy, jaundiced 24-hour stretch of ticker-taped twaddle. </p> <p>Beyond the sheer awfulness of it all, there are some genuine reasons to scrap the January window: it stretches the gap between the rich and poor clubs, it disassociates fans from footballers, it holds back the development of young players and it has little to do with the sport. </p> The January window makes football less competitive      Wilfried Bony scoring against Manchester City, his new club. Photograph: Huw Evans/REX    <p>In the unlikely event that Chelsea and Manchester City are not able to make their vast riches count in the summer transfer window, the month of January gives them an opportunity to add to their squads halfway through the season and fill in any gaps on their already over-populated benches.</p> <p>Towards the end of autumn \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps on 22 November, when Swansea City visited the Etihad and Wilfried Bony ambled through the Manchester City defence to score past Joe Hart \xe2\x80\x93 Manuel Pellegrini must have recognised that his back-up strikers were not scoring enough goals. They certainly weren\xe2\x80\x99t scoring as many as Bony, so Pellegrini took Swansea City\xe2\x80\x99s best player off their hands for \xc2\xa325m and broke up a team that had started the season so promisingly. </p> <p>Swansea were left to count their money and scout the market for world-class strikers. And the fans who bought season tickets expecting to see Bony lead the line for the entire campaign were left hoping that Baf\xc3\xa9timbi Gomis would not follow Bony out the door. All in all, the January window gives the richest clubs one less chance to fail.</p> The January window stops the development of young players     The players who won the 2014 FA Youth Cup celebrate. And so they should. It could be the last silverware they lift in Chelsea colours. Photograph: Henry Browne/Action Images    <p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho sent out a message to Roman Abramovich on Saturday. He put four teenagers on the bench, showing the Chelsea owner that he is down to the bare bones and in need of more top-class attackers. </p> <p>Never mind that Mourinho already has the best midfield in the league, with an attacking quartet of Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas, Willian, Eden Hazard and Oscar backing up the league\xe2\x80\x99s top scorer, Diego Costa. And never mind that three of these teenagers - Andreas Christensen, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Isaiah Brown - starred for Chelsea in the final of the FA Youth Cup last spring, and that the other, Nathan Ak\xc3\xa9, was signed from Feyenoord in 2011 and has represented Holland\xe2\x80\x99s various youth teams for the last seven years. Mourinho needs more players. So he is going to sign Juan Cuadrado from Fiorentina for \xc2\xa324m. </p> <p>In the Class of 92 documentary Nicky Butt said that his winners\xe2\x80\x99 medal from the FA Youth Cup was as special as any silverware he won during his career \xe2\x80\x93 and Butt was the anchor of Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s midfield when they won the Champions League final in 1999. The young players who warmed Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s bench on Saturday evening might come to feel equally fond of their Youth Cup medals. But then, they might not taste as much success in the first team. </p> The January transfer window ruins the integrity of European competitions     Juan Cuadrado helped Fiorentina reach the last 32 of the Europa League but he will be playing in the Champions League for the rest of the season. Photograph: Fabrizio Giovannozzi/AP    <p>Fiorentina visit London later this month to play Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League. The Italian club and their fans have already visited Guingamp in France, Thessaloniki in Greece and Minsk in Belarus in the competition this season. Winning the Europa League would be a big deal for Fiorentina. They are unlikely to feature in the Serie A title race so this is their best chance to pick up some silverware and qualify for next season\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League. </p> <p>The Fiorentina supporters should be excited about their trip to London this month. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a shame that their best player made the same journey a few weeks before them. Cuadrado will not be present for biggest match of their season; he will probably be on his way back from Paris, having played for Chelsea against PSG the night before. </p> The January transfer window has little to do with football    <p>.@GuillemBalague joined @JimWhite and @kate_abdo in a Deadline Day Q&amp;A which you can watch now On Demand pic.twitter.com/fC7V0w4v5i</p>&mdash; Sky Sports Football (@SkyFootball) January 31, 2015    <p>Deadline day is not really about football. It\xe2\x80\x99s a straight-to-TV pantomime show whose main star wears a yellow tie rather than a football shirt. But so much of football culture is not about football. It\xe2\x80\x99s about creating talking points that create even more talking points. Much like the modern obsession with managers\xe2\x80\x99 quotes and referees\xe2\x80\x99 decisions, deadline day cleverly perpetuates itself. The rumour mills will not stop tomorrow; they will just begin another interminable cycle. </p> <p>Deadline day feels as all-pervasive as Cup final Saturday did years ago, but the two events have one crucial difference. The hours of TV coverage on Cup final day culminated in a football match; deadline day reaches its anticlimactic conclusion when the clock counts down to zero and the TV screen is lit up with some snazzy special effects. But the cameras keep rolling for more analysis and speculation. You\xe2\x80\x99ll just have to keep reading and watching and sucking in those adverts to see what happens next.</p> <p>Enjoy your day. </p>'
