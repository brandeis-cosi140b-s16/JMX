b'Fernando Torres heals his Anfield wounds as Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez makes return'


b'<p>It was a sound which had not been heard at Anfield for more than four years and which nobody expected to ever again hear at this venue. But shortly after half-time it erupted into life, starting off in the Kop before spreading to all parts: \xe2\x80\x9cHis armband proved he was a Red, Torres, Torres, You\xe2\x80\x99ll Never Walk Alone it read, Torres, Torres, we bought the lad from sunny Spain, he gets the ball and scores again, Fernando Torres is Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s No9!\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Time, then, really is a healer, or maybe it was the fact this was a charity match and Fernando Torres had shown the warmth of spirit to travel from Madrid to Merseyside to take part. Either way, the acclaim that greeted his appearance after the interval was as heart-warming as it was surprising, proof that supporters can show love\xc2\xa0 for even the most loathed of former\xc2\xa0players.</p> <p>And loathed Torres has been in these parts ever since he joined Chelsea for \xc2\xa350m in January 2011 and described the move as a \xe2\x80\x9cbig step forward\xe2\x80\x9d. That was a deemed an almighty slap in the face by Kopites, who had taken Torres to their hearts following his arrival from Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid four years earlier. He was their swaggering superstar of a striker, scoring 33 goals in his debut season at Liverpool and, overall, 81 in 142 appearances for the club. The boys wanted to be like him, the girls wanted to be with him, he was Elvis in a red shirt. And then he left the building.</p> <p>Torres\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate failure at Stamford Bridge may also have contributed to the warm reception he received on an otherwise chilly day on Merseyside, as no doubt did the fact he ran out for the second-half alongside a man who also left Liverpool for big money but has never stopped being adored by the Anfield faithful.</p> <p>10 months after coming agonisingly close to inspiring the Merseysiders to the Premier League title, Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez was back. With No7 on his back and frantic energy busting through his boots, it was as if the Uruguayan had never been away let alone bitten someone at the World Cup, moved to Barcelona for \xc2\xa375m and scored 14 goals in 29 games for the Catalan club in the interim. Like Torres, he was cheered and serenaded by a capacity crowd here, for whom the sight of Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s best two strikers of the past 20 years in tandem was not only a rare treat but also a case of what might have been given Su\xc3\xa1rez joined the club shortly before Torres left. As the Spaniard, now back at Atl\xc3\xa9tico, revealed in an interview prior to this match, the pair \xe2\x80\x9csat for two days\xe2\x80\x9d at Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Melwood training base before he departed for Chelsea and \xe2\x80\x9cbecame good friends\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>There certainly appeared to be chemistry between the pair as they continuously looked to link up for the 45 minutes they were on the pitch together, with Su\xc3\xa1rez attempting a few quick one-twos with his strike partner early on before Torres reciprocated with a couple of through passes late on. Ultimately, neither got on the scoresheet, but that really did not matter on a day where the priority was raising as much money as possible for Liverpool FC Foundation, the club\xe2\x80\x99s official charity. This \xe2\x80\x9cAll-Star\xe2\x80\x9d match saw a team, captained by Steven Gerrard, take on one captained by his former Anfield colleague Jamie Carragher. As is typical of all such fixtures, the names on show were of far greater interest than the quality of the play, which at its most competitive barely rose above meandering.</p> <p>Alongside Torres, Su\xc3\xa1rez, Gerrard and Carragher, a somewhat surreal mix of players took part. There were other Liverpool greats, such as Pepe Reina, Xabi Alonso and Luis Garc\xc3\xada, as well as those who never made the grade at the club, such as Ryan Babel, Charlie Adam and Stewart Downing, and those who are part of the current squad, such as Glen Johnson, Jon Flanagan and Mario Balotelli. There were a host of figures from other clubs and other eras with this no doubt the first and probably only time that John Terry and Didier Drogba received applause from Liverpool fans.</p> <p>Balotelli and Drogba gave the Carragher XI a 2-0 lead before Gerrard pulled one back for his own side with a 37th-minute penalty. The 34-year\xe2\x80\x91old, who a week ago was sent off at Anfield during Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 loss to Manchester United, made it 2-2 with another penalty on 69 minutes.</p> <p>He celebrated with Su\xc3\xa1rez and Torres, with the latter clearly appreciative of the reception he received. Prior to kick-off, Fernando by Abba had been played over the PA system. \xe2\x80\x9cEl Ni\xc3\xb1o\xe2\x80\x9d may not have heard the drums, but he certainly heard the Kop\xe2\x80\x99s once common acclaim.</p>'
