b'Manchester City defender Eliaquim Mangala is ready to take the pressure'


b'<p>Eliaquim Mangala is the most expensive defender in England at \xc2\xa332m, yet the former Porto centre back admits it may be a while before he gets a game. An unused substitute with France at the World Cup, the 23-year-old arrived at Manchester City a little short of match fitness, and even when he is ready he still faces the task of displacing Mart\xc3\xadn Demichelis or Vincent Kompany, two centre halves who did appear for their countries in Brazil.</p> <p>City\xe2\x80\x99s keynote signing of the summer is not the most physically imposing of stoppers either. Centre halves have slimmed down quite a bit since Bill Shankly invited local journalists into the Liverpool dressing room to be shown round Ron Yeats, but even so Mangala is willowy. At just under 6ft 2in his weight is a mere 11st 9lb, which makes him around the same as Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero and lighter than Samir Nasri. Signed for his pace and mobility as much as his defensive awareness, Mangala realises the Premier League will be a particular challenge.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cObviously it is a lot more physical style of football to what I have been used to,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIn England there are more one-on-one battles with the strikers and duels in the air. The style in Portugal is a lot slower, it is a more intricate passing game with a more deliberate build-up to attacks.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHere it is faster, I think, more physical and more intense. A game in England is 90 minutes of effort, you can tell that from watching on television. The other thing that stands out about the English league is that if you go away to someone low down, bottom of the league for example, you can\xe2\x80\x99t take anything for granted. Each team can beat anyone else, and that is quite unusual. That aspect is different.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It will be interesting to see how quickly Mangala adapts to the Premier League style, as well as whether the reputation he gained in Portugal for alertness and anticipation survives the transition to the more knockabout English game. Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho obviously thought it would, since interest from Chelsea was one of the factors that pushed his price so high. In fact, Mangala was quoted in French newspapers over the summer saying he would prefer to live in London than Manchester. Where Mangala has ended up that is close to an arrestable offence, though it is a charge he does not attempt to deny.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI did say that, I was put on the spot at the end of a French TV programme,\xe2\x80\x9d he explains. \xe2\x80\x9cThe guy said to me \xe2\x80\x99Manchester or London?\xe2\x80\x99. I did not want to answer the question but in the end I said London, because it was the capital. It was nothing to do with football.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Perhaps understandably, Mangala is now keen to stress that he always wanted to come to City and is happy to be here now after some fairly protracted negotiations involving third-party ownership.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen City expressed their interest, I had conversations straight away with the coach and the sporting director,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThat didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen with anyone else, they were the only club I talked to at that level. I did not become worried. I was in contact with the club all the time, they kept me informed on all the twists and turns, so I was never sweating too much. There were lots of other reasons: City were the champions, I had a chance to develop my career by playing alongside other quality players, and I felt straight away there is a real positive energy about the place. Now I have been involved in a few training sessions I feel even more certain I made the right choice.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere are some really big targets to aim for this season and every session is intense. There is pressure on everyone to perform and to succeed, but you feel that pressure in a positive way. It feels like all the preparation is really important. Even though City have won the title twice in three seasons there is still potential at the club to do more. There\xe2\x80\x99s just an incredibly positive atmosphere around the place.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mangala speaks generously of Kompany and Demichelis, and how much he is looking forward to learning from them, although City\xe2\x80\x99s present centre-back pairing could have been bought three times over, with a few million to spare, for the size of the fee handed to Porto.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe amount of money City paid was not down to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was nothing I could do about that. Like everybody else I had certain dreams when I started out. I wanted to grow up to be a professional footballer, I wanted to play in the Champions League or to try playing in England, but I never thought: \xe2\x80\x98one day I will be the most expensive English defender\xe2\x80\x99. It\xe2\x80\x99s not something you set out to achieve, and right now it\xe2\x80\x99s something I am trying not to pay attention to too much. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s something the fans and the press will talk about, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to remove myself from those thoughts and concentrate on what I am being paid to do. You could say it\xe2\x80\x99s an extra pressure, but if you can\xe2\x80\x99t live with that sort of pressure football is probably not the job for you. You should be staying at home and doing something else.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Coolness under pressure is what City supporters can look forward to seeing when Mangala, twice a champion in Portugal, is ready for action. Until then they can only be encouraged by his attitude to the challenges ahead.</p> <p>Asked about his ambitions for the season, City\xe2\x80\x99s new signing proves far from shy, or behind the door as they say in his new parish. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do we want to win? Basically, everything,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cObviously the first target for current champions is to hold on to the title and not let that out of your grasp, and it would be fantastic to win the Champions League, but at a club like City you can go into every match and every competition with the mindset of going all the way and winning it. I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy to be a part of that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
