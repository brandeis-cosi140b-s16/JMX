b'Manchester United v West Brom: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>United can\xe2\x80\x99t find a way through. West Brom win three points at Old Trafford for the second time in two seasons. Say what you want about Pulisball but the defensive resilience gave them the chance to get this stunning result. United have lost three league games on the bounce now. Liverpool are four points behind them with three to play. They probably won\xe2\x80\x99t catch United but Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s side need to make sure of that with a win at sometime during their run-in. West Brom should be safe. They have 40 points. Thanks for your emails. Bye. </p>'
