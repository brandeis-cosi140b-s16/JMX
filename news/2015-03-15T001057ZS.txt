b'Cameo of the week <p>6: Days between new Rangers director Chris Graham predicting \xe2\x80\x9cas far as the boardroom is concerned, the turmoil is over\xe2\x80\x9d, and resigning for tweeting a picture of the prophet Muhammad performing a sex act on Jar Jar Binks. </p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Owner Dave King\xe2\x80\x99s week-one pledge to fans, before the reshaped board\xe2\x80\x99s early setback: a focus on long-term credibility. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not just a question of plugging a hole over the next couple of weeks. That\xe2\x80\x99s the easy part.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Imaginary card etiquette <p>Arbiter of the week: John Terry, still upset by PSG \xe2\x80\x9ccharging the ref\xe2\x80\x9d, explaining in April last year how it should be done \xe2\x80\x93 advising Phil Dowd to send off Chico Flores with respect. \xe2\x80\x9cI just said: \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a second yellow for me.\xe2\x80\x99 Fair play to Phil, the ref, it was a big decision to make and I thought he made the right one. Credit goes to him for that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Football family news <p>Last week\xe2\x80\x99s boardroom latest:</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s FA facing a seven-day deadline to release full unredacted financial records to a government inquiry, six months after a reported \xe2\x80\x9cmystery fire\xe2\x80\x9d destroyed their accounts office. Government officials say they plan to \xe2\x80\x9ctrack down every kobo\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Zimbabwe\xe2\x80\x99s FA auctioning off its office furniture due to \xe2\x80\x9ca debt quagmire\xe2\x80\x9d, a year after president Cuthbert Dube set out his plan to fix it. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe some people will ask if I\xe2\x80\x99m alright in my head, but we\xe2\x80\x99re going to diversify into farming. Cattle ranching and crop farming. There\xe2\x80\x99s no way you can fail.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s FA disciplinary body banning Gr\xc3\xaamio director Nestor Hein for 30 days after he called them \xe2\x80\x9cthe most vile and disgusting body in the world\xe2\x80\x9d. Hein said he was upset when an STJD official who ruled against Gr\xc3\xaamio in a racism case was later acquitted after he posted racist photos online. \xe2\x80\x9cNext time I visit the STJD I\xe2\x80\x99ll wear a nose clip, for the stench.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Meanwhile: PR News <p>Set to lift the tone this week: Fifa partner and Russian gas giant Gazprom launching its third annual Children\xe2\x80\x99s Football For Friendship project \xe2\x80\x93 first unveiled at a 2013 press event with Vladimir Putin. Last year\xe2\x80\x99s project featured children from 16 nations, including Ukraine, promoting \xe2\x80\x9cfriendship between different countries\xe2\x80\x9d plus \xe2\x80\x9ctradition, peace and fair play\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> Manager news <p>Last week\xe2\x80\x99s moves:</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Jan: Ian Holloway on Millwall\xe2\x80\x99s owner John Berylson: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the owner I\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted for years. And he\xe2\x80\x99s the owner I\xe2\x80\x99d die for. And if he ends up killing me with his sword it\xe2\x80\x99ll be respectful, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be right and it\xe2\x80\x99ll be done correctly, and I\xe2\x80\x99d have deserved it because I\xe2\x80\x99d have let him down \xe2\x80\x93 at least in one year\xe2\x80\x99s time.\xe2\x80\x9d 4 Mar: Berylson: \xe2\x80\x9cI am fully supportive of the manager\xe2\x80\x9d. 11 Mar: Sacks him.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Italy, Dec: Cagliari president Tommaso Giulini sacks Zdenek Zeman and hires Gianfranco Zola. \xe2\x80\x9cThose who are writing I did this for publicity are those who write bullshit.

We have never questioned the position of Enrique. It has never come up.\xe2\x80\x9d 12 Mar: It comes up.</p> Plus: tidiest reign <p>Ghana: BA United sacking coach Mohammed Gargo one game after hiring him \xe2\x80\x93 officials claiming he upset morale by implying his players were only \xe2\x80\x9cso bad\xe2\x80\x9d because they liked to bet on themselves to lose. \xe2\x80\x9cHis comments were detestable. We can\xe2\x80\x99t be keeping him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Clarification of the week <p>France: Lyon owner Jean-Michel Aulas \xe2\x80\x93 asked if he\xe2\x80\x99d apologise for branding a Twitter critic \xe2\x80\x9cautistic\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, where\xe2\x80\x99s the offence? Autistic means someone who has a behavioural disorder. I know what I mean.\xe2\x80\x9d In December Aulas told another critic to \xe2\x80\x9cgo to bed\xe2\x80\x9d; the boy, aged eight, hit back: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not my father, you don\xe2\x80\x99t set my bedtime.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Assessing Aulas\xe2\x80\x99s record, Montpellier owner Louis \xe2\x80\x9cLoulou\xe2\x80\x9d Nicollin: \xe2\x80\x9cFor some time now, Aulas has annoyed me. He talks too much, with no humility\xe2\x80\x9d. Also from Loulou last week \xe2\x80\x93 a verdict on Marseille coach Marcelo Bielsa. \xe2\x80\x9cBielsa? Simply a dickhead. If he worked for me, I\xe2\x80\x99d sack him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Best preview <p>Former Sri Lanka captain Ashok Nawgalage, teeing up their shock 1-0 defeat to the world\xe2\x80\x99s bottom-ranked team, Bhutan: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no point punching someone who is 36 positions below us. Playing Bhutan is not very useful, even for acquiring experience.\xe2\x80\x9d Local media reported Bhutan \xe2\x80\x9ccelebrated with a trip to KFC\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> Crouching Tigres <p>Mexico: Tigres coach Ricardo Ferretti \xe2\x80\x93 sent to the stands for abuse \xe2\x80\x93 feeling \xe2\x80\x9cno regrets\xe2\x80\x9d after cameras caught him hiding from the referee behind seats in the back of his dugout instead. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was wrong, my gestures were not expellable, so I stayed. There was no disrespect.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>    <p>#TeAmoTuca #MeEscondoComoElTuca cuando ganan los Leones pic.twitter.com/fF7D12TQnE</p>&mdash; Mauro Hernandez (@MAURAZZOTV) March 9, 2015    Plus: best rebuttal <p>Mexico: Ronaldinho, denying \xe2\x80\x9clacking professionalism\xe2\x80\x9d at Quer\xc3\xa9taro, and releasing the video for his new track Come to Me, with the chorus: \xe2\x80\x9cWe get into the funky groove/My body entwined with your body/The smell of your fragrant neck/I\xe2\x80\x99m hooked on this tasty grind.\xe2\x80\x9d The new track follows 2014\xe2\x80\x99s collaboration I\xe2\x80\x99m Full of Money \xe2\x80\xa6 Let\xe2\x80\x99s Drink.</p>'
