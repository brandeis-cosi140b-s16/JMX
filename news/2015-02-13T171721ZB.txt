b'Bradford City v Sunderland: match preview'


b'<p>After conquering Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the fourth round, can Phil Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s League One side do it again? Struggling in the top flight, Sunderland certainly look vulnerable while Gus Poyet has already voiced concerns about the state of Bradford\xe2\x80\x99s pitch. Poyet, though, needs to win a few hearts and minds on Wearside after once again accusing Sunderland supporters of craving kick and rush football. Those comments have not gone down at all well with most fans vehemently disagreeing with him.
