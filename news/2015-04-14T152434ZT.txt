b'The Fiver | The fangs of relegation'


b'<p>JOE DE VIVRE</p> <p>When, to protest at the way their club is run by chairman Karl Oyston, Blackpool supporters bombarded the Bloomfield Road directors\xe2\x80\x99 box with eggs before last week\xe2\x80\x99s draw with Reading, The Fiver could only despair at their mindlessness. Why oh why hadn\xe2\x80\x99t they used garlic? Or holy water? At least some of the team\xe2\x80\x99s wingers probably shanked a couple of crosses towards the posh seats but that, evidently, has not proved enough to drive away the vampire that fans fear is in the club\xe2\x80\x99s midst.</p> <p>In fairness, the notion that Oyston is sucking the lifeblood from Blackpool is one that the man himself bats away. He points out that the club is in fact in rude health, having posted a profit of \xc2\xa39m last month, making it a model of sustainability that other clubs would do well to emulate. Oyston, whose father Owen bought the club in 1987, likes to portray himself as a crusader for financial prudence, and you can certainly imagine him in a cape. The payments that the club has made in recent years to companies owned by various Oystons have been all about pursuing tax efficiency on behalf of the club, not bleeding it dry, and you should be careful how you express interpretations to the contrary, lest you be branded a \xe2\x80\x9cmassive retard\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>It is unfortunate that Blackpool\xe2\x80\x99s players have all season long been producing performances so impoverished that The Fiver has often considered donating them a clue. In fairness, the fangs of relegation always looked like being sunk into the side ever since it was hastily cobbled together on the eve of the campaign after their pre-season tour to Spain was scrapped because they did not have enough players to participate in a proper round of drinks, let alone a football match. Sure enough, the aforementioned draw with Reading rammed a wooden stake into their feeble attempt to avoid the drop. On the plus side, Oyston could point with pride to the resourcefulness that some of his players showed even for that match, it having emerged today that goalkeeper Joe Lewis improvised impressively when confronted with a lack of workwear at the club.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBefore starting the game I noticed Joe Lewis\xe2\x80\x99s shirt,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Blackpool\xe2\x80\x99s Spanish midfielder Andrea Orlandi in his weekly column for the website am14. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was signed and I thought he was going to do a raffle after the game [a common practice in England]. It turns out that no, he had not even noticed or knew anything about it and when he tried to get another one he was told there were none left.\xe2\x80\x9d It is not clear who told Lewis that, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the club\xe2\x80\x99s kit man, because the club doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a kit man any more. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was funny because he tried to put a plaster over the writing to cover it and it looked even more funny,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Orlandi. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are details that should be improved as a club. A small thing? Probably, but still not a normal thing for a Championship club,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Orlandi, who did not reveal whether the writing on the jersey was by Bram Stoker.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Jacob Steinberg from 7.45pm BST for MBM coverage of Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid 2-1 Real Madrid, while Paul Doyle will be in the hot seat for Juventus 2-0 Monaco.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cP0rn? No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not p0rn. It\xe2\x80\x99s a piece of art. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a piece of art. But you can see it like this. It\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful. You should see it. Unfortunately, p0rn is not so aesthetic and so beautiful. But love is $ex also, you know?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Eric Cantona takes time out from crowning Javier Pastore as the world\xe2\x80\x99s best player and Catalonia as champions of the world in 2010 to denounce claims that his new film, You and the Night, is of the bongo variety.</p> RECOMMENDED VIEWING <p>We packed Julien Laurens off to Paris to discuss all things French football with Darren Tullett and Henri Ghnassia.</p>            FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAh, tumbleweed (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters). It\xe2\x80\x99s the quintessential image of the deserted, barren American West, a bleak landscape bereft of the gifts of civilisation. Has The Fiver adopted a new image for itself? Will there be ironic T-shirts available for purchase? More importantly, by highlighting its own wind-swept emptiness, did The Fiver really think that a picture of tumbleweed would prompt letter-writing from the pedants? Oh\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Mike Wilner.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI realise you are suffering from a paucity of literary contributions but to publish a photograph of a decapitated Carlos Valderrama lying in the middle of the road, is both tasteless and represents lazy journalism\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Nick Kershaw.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI reread The Fiver at 11pm last night. Looking for letters, all I saw were the words \xe2\x80\x98prizeless\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98rollover\xe2\x80\x99. I thought immediately of Newcastle United\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Paul Watson.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

It\xe2\x80\x99s down to the quality and the attitude of the team, the quality of the spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d he purred.</p> <p>Lionel Messi reckons that being a dad has helped him re-discover his form on the pitch. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore, if I missed a chance or I had a bad game, I would not speak to anyone for three of four days.

Probably.</p> <p>Bayern have lost Arjen Robben, Franck Rib\xc3\xa9ry, Bastian Schweinsteiger and David Alaba among others for their Big Cup quarter-final first leg against Porto on Wednesday, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t give a damn about it.</p> <p>And GB sprinter Richard Kilty is so fed up at seeing hacks claim that Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s H\xc3\xa9ctor Beller\xc3\xadn is faster than Usain Bolt over 40m that he\xe2\x80\x99s willing to put \xc2\xa330,000 where his mouth is and race the Frenchman, as well as Theo Walcott for good measure. \xe2\x80\x9cMedia claiming @HectorBellerin can run 4.42 over 40m. Absolutely no way. Are these journalists complete morons!\xe2\x80\x9d he roared.</p>      STILL WANT MORE? <p>What happened to the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s 10 youngest players, asks Nick Ames, before going on to answer his own question.</p> <p>Which conveniently leads on to the youngest of those players, Matthew Briggs, being interviewed to within an inch of his life by \xe2\x80\x93 you guessed it \xe2\x80\x93 Nick Ames.</p> <p>An exclusive interview with the Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri? Go on then.</p> <p>Fernando Torres will be on the bench for Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s Big Cup quarter-final first-leg tie, and according to Sid Lowe, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind one little bit.
