b'QPR v Manchester City: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened | Scott Murray'


b'<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s that! The end of a wonderful game. It\xe2\x80\x99s a draw, probably a fair result on balance. A useful one for Rangers as they embark on their quest to haul themselves out of bother. Not a very good one for City, who are now eight points behind Chelsea. A great evening for Jose Mourinho and his men, though. Hart has the good grace to go up to Austin and explain what happened with that free kick in the first half. The two depart the scene on good terms. There\xe2\x80\x99s nice. But it looks like it\xe2\x80\x99s up to Southampton if we want ourselves a title race this season. Poor Manchester City Man!</p>'
