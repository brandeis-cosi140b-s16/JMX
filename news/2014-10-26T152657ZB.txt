b'Burnley v Everton: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened | Daniel Harris'


b'<p>A composed, competent performance from Everton, who were patient in possession and able to speed things up when the opportunities presented themselves. In particular, Baines was lively down the left, Naismith inventive and energetic in midfield, and Eto\xe2\x80\x99o a menace up front. </p> <p>As for Burnley, well, they weren\xe2\x80\x99t quite good enough to compete, beyond the first-half period in which they scored. Arfield and Igns were dangerous here and there, but otherwise, they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite find the intensity that might have made things harder to Everton. </p> <p>Anyway, Everton move up to 9th in the table, Burnley stay second-bottom. </p>'
