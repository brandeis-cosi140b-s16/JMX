b'Falcao, Welbeck, Ben Arfa: how will new boys fit in this weekend?'


b'Arsenal <p>Olivier Giroud is out injured until the Christmas period, which meant Arsenal pounced to sign Danny Welbeck from Manchester United on deadline day. Although Welbeck\xe2\x80\x99s goalscoring record is underwhelming at club level, he has often been deployed in wide positions, and should receive more opportunities in a central role at Arsenal. His two goals in England\xe2\x80\x99s 2-0 victory over Switzerland on Monday, meanwhile, demonstrated his finishing ability nicely.</p>     How Arsenal could line up this weekend Photograph: Guardian graphic    <p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger should throw Welbeck into Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s starting XI immediately for the visit of Manchester City at lunchtime on Saturday, as Yaya Sanogo remains an unconvincing option as central striker. Welbeck will come short and play neat passes with onrushing midfielders, one of Giroud\xe2\x80\x99s major qualities, and offer sheer speed in behind \xe2\x80\x93 something the Frenchman lacks.</p> Manchester United <p>Louis van Gaal could hand debuts to four players against Queens Park Rangers on Sunday, with \xc3\x81ngel Di Mar\xc3\xada also set for his home debut.</p> <p>The most exciting newcomer would be Radamel Falcao, although the striker faces competition with Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie the men in possession. Should Falcao start, Rooney seems a more natural partner for the Colombian than Van Persie, who has increasingly become a penalty-area poacher in the Falcao mould.</p>     How United could line up this weekend Photograph: Guardian graphic    <p>Three left-footed players could also make their first appearance. Marcos Rojo should take Tyler Blackett\xe2\x80\x99s spot on the left of defence, with Luke Shaw now under consideration and a better wing-back option than Ashley Young. Daley Blind played both those roles under Van Gaal at the World Cup but should start deep in midfield.</p> Crystal Palace <p>A few debutants should feature against Burnley on Saturday \xe2\x80\x93 but much of the attention will be on Neil Warnock, in his first game back at Selhurst Park.</p> <p>Zeki Fryers will hope to go straight into the starting XI at left-back. Martin Kelly and Joel Ward have played that position so far, with both capable of playing on the opposite side too \xe2\x80\x93 Ward\xe2\x80\x99s place might come under threat but he\xe2\x80\x99s a fine, underrated player and would find his way back into the side.</p>     How Palace could line up this weekend Photograph: Guardian graphic    <p>James McArthur is a natural partner for Mile Jedinak in the centre of the pitch, while up front Marouane Chamakh is doubtful and Kevin Doyle could play his hard\xe2\x80\x91working, withdrawn centre\xe2\x80\x91forward role, allowing Dwight Gayle to sprint in behind the opposition. Andy Johnson is another new option.</p> Hull City <p>Steve Bruce has generally played a 3-5-2 system in 2014 but he is a tactically flexible manager and, even before deadline day, his signings of Tom Ince and Robert Snodgrass suggested he wanted to try something different.</p> <p>Therefore, Hull could switch to a 4-3-3. This would bring the best out of Tom Huddlestone, who is best behind two hard-working midfielders such as Jake Livermore and newcomer Mohamed Diam\xc3\xa9.</p>     How City could line up this weekend Photograph: Guardian graphic    <p>Further forward, however, is the most exciting zone. Gast\xc3\xb3n Ram\xc3\xadrez and Hatem Ben Arfa, two extremely talented if inconsistent attacking midfielders, could float behind the new Uruguayan striker Abel Hern\xc3\xa1ndez. With those three all set to make their debuts, it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to guess how well they will combine \xe2\x80\x93 but it could lead to some fantastic football.</p> Queens Park Rangers <p>Harry Redknapp has visited Old Trafford 14 times in the Premier League and is yet to collect a point \xe2\x80\x93 if that is to change, he will need good performances from two deadline-day signings.</p> <p>Redknapp is forever signing players he has already worked with and these recruits are no different. Sandro will play his usual solid, unfussy holding role, allowing Joey Barton and Leroy Fer to scamper forward into attack.</p>     How Rangers could line up this weekend Photograph: Guardian graphic    <p>Niko Kranjcar, meanwhile, has joined Redknapp for the fourth time, following spells at Portsmouth, Tottenham and a previous loan spell at QPR last season. Capable of playing from either flank or in a more central role, the Croat provides some badly needed attacking quality for a side who have mustered only a single goal in this season\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League.</p> Sunderland <p>Ricardo \xc3\x81lvarez flattered to deceive at Internazionale \xe2\x80\x93 there were some promising dribbles and some neat passes, but he was highly inconsistent.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Gus Poyet is likely to give \xc3\x81lvarez an opportunity to impress, and he seems best for the left-sided role in Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s 4-3-3 \xe2\x80\x93 it would be a huge risk to base the side around him as a No10 in a 4-2-3-1. He is a good counterattacking player, which fits into the way Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s Sunderland played in their surprising escape from relegation last season.</p>     How Sunderland could line up this weekend Photograph: Guardian graphic    <p>Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s fellow Uruguayan Sebasti\xc3\xa1n Coates was not handed many chances at Liverpool and it is difficult to imagine he will start ahead of John O\xe2\x80\x99Shea and Wes Brown for now, although he could work his way into the side over the course of the season.</p> The rest <p>Southampton, who host Newcastle on Saturday, were also highly active on deadline day, with Sadio Man\xc3\xa9 an energetic, versatile attacker who will help Ronald Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s side press high up the pitch. Toby Alderweireld has often deputised at full-back for Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid and Belgium, but seems Dejan Lovren\xe2\x80\x99s replacement in the centre.</p> <p>Burnley have been understaffed in their first few matches, but the arrival of George Boyd plus loanees Nathaniel Chalobah and Michael Keane provides Sean Dyche with more options for the trip to Selhurst Park \xe2\x80\x93 the type of game Burnley must collect points from if they are to survive in the Premier League.</p> <p>Meanwhile, West Ham United will hope to hand a debut to the former West Brom loanee Morgan Amalfitano, with Alex Song also in line for his debut at Hull on Monday night \xe2\x80\x93 Sam Allardyce\xe2\x80\x99s side look far more adventurous than last season.</p>'
