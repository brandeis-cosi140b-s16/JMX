b'The Fiver | As blank as a blank thing that has graduated in blank studies from the University of Blankshire'


b'SLOW NEWS DAY <p>Sometimes people come to the Fiver and ask for tips about doing good journalism. Don\xe2\x80\x99t laugh \xe2\x80\x93 under no circumstances must you ever laugh when you\xe2\x80\x99re reading the Fiver. And it happens. All the time. \xe2\x80\x9cHelp me, Fiver,\xe2\x80\x9d they say, desperately trying to ignore the odd smell of mustard, tuna and stale Paco Rabanne that\xe2\x80\x99s lingering in the air. \xe2\x80\x9cFiver, please tell me how to be as good at journalism as you are. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be forever grateful.\xe2\x80\x9d The answer is straightforward. Getting by is simple. If, say, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been set the task of writing some satirical jokes about football, but it\xe2\x80\x99s Wednesday afternoon and nothing is going on and your mind is as blank as a blank thing that has graduated with first-class honours in blank studies from the University of Blankshire and your bosses are burning a hole in the back of your head and you feel like you might cry, then you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to improvise.</p> <p>For instance, look how you can use these very interesting quotes from Thibaut Courtois about the chances of Chelsea winning the quadruple as a clever way of filling up space. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to say if we could win all four but we are playing well,\xe2\x80\x9d Courtois yawned after last night\xe2\x80\x99s spawny 1-1 draw with Liverpool in the first leg of Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Milk Cup semi-final. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have passed through all competitions. Now we are in the semi-final of the Capital One Cup, top of the league, there is an important game in the FA Cup on Saturday which we have to win and soon we will be playing PSG in the Champions League. It will be hard but we have the team that can win everything. It\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99re aiming for.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Quality. One paragraph out of the way and it\xe2\x80\x99s dedicated to a footballer wanting to win some trophies. This is textbook stuff. Your bosses will be none the wiser. The idiots. It\xe2\x80\x99s not as if they read this stuff anyway. In fact, the Fiver could probably write whatever it fancies and get away with it. For example, have you ever spent an afternoon wondering if it would be better to be kicked in the groin by Lee Cattermole once a day or tickled by Tony Pulis every 15 minutes? The Fiver has and it still can\xe2\x80\x99t decide. Cattermole would kick like he really meant it. But Pulis would probably be quite put out at having to take time out of his day to pretend that he\xe2\x80\x99s Mr Tickle every 15 minutes and would probably be quite tetchy, which is not what you want in a tickler. It\xe2\x80\x99s a conundrum. By the way, there\xe2\x80\x99s a big Milk Cup semi-final between Tottenham and Sheffield United tonight, but unfortunately we\xe2\x80\x99ve run out of time and space. That\xe2\x80\x99s journalism!</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Paul Doyle NOW for Equatorial Guinea 1-1 Burkina Faso in the Africa Cup of Nations. And if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t had enough of him by then, Paul will be back for Tottenham 3-1 Sheffield United at 7.45pm GMT.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNo surprises it was pasta but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t bad. His new role might be club chef. It was well cooked and we all gave our opinions of it to him and everyone said they liked it\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Nasty Leeds manager Neil Redfearn offers a clue as to how Massimo Cellino may go about dodging his disqualification as the club\xe2\x80\x99s owner after Cellino cooked the squad a meal before last night\xe2\x80\x99s win against Bournemouth.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY TWO <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the first time. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bit unusual, perhaps, but it\xe2\x80\x99s quite neutral. Among other parents to have chosen Liverpool names there was one couple who called their daughter Tia after \xe2\x80\x98This is Anfield\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Christian Moller, chair of Norway\xe2\x80\x99s Liverpool fans\xe2\x80\x99 group, desperately tries to justify the decision of two supporters to name their daughter YNWA after \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ll Never Walk Alone\xe2\x80\x99. </p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIain Moody\xe2\x80\x99s interview (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Bits and Bobs) featured the quote \xe2\x80\x98I think everyone has got something you can refer to in your own past to say: why did I do that?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 can I be the first of 1,057 people to make a ham-fisted attempt at an analogy involving signing up to receive the Fiver?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ed Taylor.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99ll only be one of the 1,057 but I feel I have to point out that you sent yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver, complete with an \xe2\x80\x98Ivory Coast 2-0 Guinea in the Africa Cup of Nations\xe2\x80\x99 score prediction, after Guinea had already taken a 1-0 lead.
