b'<p>Liverpool are considering a move for the veteran Cameroon striker Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o as they look to increase Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 forward options before the transfer deadline.</p> <p>The 33-year-old is a free agent having been released by Chelsea at the end of last season and has held talks with Ajax over a move to Amsterdam. Liverpool have not made an offer to the former Real Madrid, Barcelona and Internazionale goalscorer as yet, and are discussing several names, but Eto\xe2\x80\x99o has emerged as a possible target.</p> <p>The striker is believed to have earned \xc2\xa37m from his one-year deal at Stamford Bridge, an annual drop of \xc2\xa313m from his contract with Anzhi Makhachkala, but his wage demands are unlikely to deter Liverpool given the player\xe2\x80\x99s availability on a free transfer.</p> <p>Rodgers remains determined to add a striker to his squad before 1 September having sold Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez to Barcelona for \xc2\xa375m and seen a proposed \xc2\xa38m move for Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my of Queens Park Rangers collapse on medical grounds.</p> <p>Liverpool inquired about Radamel Falcao at Monaco, but were informed he would only leave the principality for Real Madrid and for an exorbitant loan fee, and are approaching the new Premier League season with an attack comprising Daniel Sturridge, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini. A \xc2\xa314m deal has been agreed with Sunderland for Borini, though he has been reluctant to make a permanent exit from Anfield.</p>'
