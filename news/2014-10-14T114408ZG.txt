b'Guus Hiddink sinking as Holland miss Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s iron fist'


b'<p>It seemed like the perfect way to end his career. Guus Hiddink has had some bad managerial spells of late (Russia didn\xe2\x80\x99t qualify for the 2010 World Cup, Turkey didn\xe2\x80\x99t reach Euro 2012, the project with the big spenders Anzhi Makhachkala ended abruptly) but those would be forgotten, provided he could lead a successful campaign with the Dutch national team shining brightly at France 2016.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be too hard,\xe2\x80\x9d he must have thought when he signed some months before the World Cup 2014 in Brazil, to do better than his predecessor, Louis van Gaal, who had rebuilt the Oranje with a number of promising yet fairly green talents such as Daryl Janmaat, Stefan de Vrij, Bruno Martins Indi, Daley Blind and Memphis Depay. A team that were comprehensively beaten in a pre-World Cup friendly with France.</p> <p>How bad things have turned out for Hiddink. Holland were third in Brazil, beating the hosts in their final match 3-0. Expectations for that tournament were to be eliminated at the group stage or maybe fortuitously survive and then be demolished by Brazil. But Van Gaal introduced a rare defensive system (5-3-2) and a flying start against Spain (5-1) helped the youthful Dutch on their way to a journey that was just as surprising as the current downfall.</p> <p>With the youngsters making transfers to big foreign leagues (Janmaat to Newcastle, De Vrij to Lazio, Martins Indi to Porto, Blind to Manchester United), or developing into leaders at their Dutch clubs (Jordy Clasie at Feyenoord, Georginio Wijnaldum and Depay at PSV) and the veterans still around their 30s with vital roles at their elite clubs (Van Persie at Man United, Nigel de Jong at Milan, Arjen Robben at Bayern Munich), not to mention class acts such as Rafael van der Vaart, Gregory van der Wiel and Afellay set to make their return after injuries, the Oranje future looked bright.</p> <p>The media were also on Hiddink\xe2\x80\x99s side. While Van Gaal argued with or ignored them, Hiddink is always the perfect gentleman, giving them quotes or columns, even inviting some of them to his hotel to talk for hours with a big cigar.</p>            Robin van Persie: \xe2\x80\x98We were sloppy against Iceland.\xe2\x80\x99    <p>Hiddink had good memories of France, the country where he made his big triumph as a national team coach by almost leading Holland to the final of the 1998 World Cup only to be denied a penalty in the semis against Brazil and losing, once again, on penalties.</p> <p>After that Guus Geluk (Lucky Guus) had similar success with South Korea, reaching the semis at the 2002 World Cup, taking Australia to the last 16 in 2006, with PSV, with Russia by getting to the semi-final at Euro 2008, murdering Holland along the way, and with Chelsea.</p> <p>Guus was God. But in overtime the man from the small farming town of Varsseveld has fallen from his pedestal. The loss to Italy in a friendly could be put down to an early red card of Martins Indi. But the late defeat against Czech Republic in Prague (2-1) unleashed the wrecking ball. Hiddink had proclaimed to return to the original Dutch 4-3-3-system, turning his nose up at Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s 5-3-2, but he returned to just that system against the Czechs.</p> <p>Hiddink gambled on his usual tricks, colliding with the oldies, criticising the youngsters for not being hard or smart enough, nevertheless creating a \xe2\x80\x9cfun\xe2\x80\x9d atmosphere. Wesley Sneijder said things were more relaxed, because Louis van Gaal was like \xe2\x80\x9cthe tough schoolteacher\xe2\x80\x9d and Hiddink \xe2\x80\x9cmore the friendly uncle\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>But this approach is starting to backfire in his face. After Kazakhstan were beaten 3-1, only by late goals from Klaas-Jan Huntelaar (a header), Afellay (a deflected shot) and Robin van Persie (a doubtful penalty) last Friday, the only thing people in Holland were talking about was the feud between the captain, Van Persie, and the supersub Huntelaar (and how that never would have happened under Van Gaal).</p> <p>After a shot from Van Persie went wide, Huntelaar, who waited at the far post, told him to look next time. Van Persie made clear Huntelaar shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t talk so much. Hiddink claimed after the match it was no big deal but later on a meeting with Hiddink, the assistant Ruud van Nistelrooy and the vice-captain Arjen Robben was needed to clear the air.</p> <p>It turned out to be an image killer for Van Persie. Holland\xe2\x80\x99s all-time goalscorer was being vilified in the Dutch media and on social media. Suddenly everybody seemed to be fed up with the Oranje, and although the performance against Kazakhstan wasn\xe2\x80\x99t that bad, pressure rose for the early do-or-die-match at Iceland. And Holland \xe2\x80\x9cdied\xe2\x80\x9d between the volcanoes and geysers like maybe never before. Mistakes from De Vrij and Van der Wiel lead to an 2-0 defeat. More concerning was the inability to create hardly any chances in the second half. \xe2\x80\x9cThere seems to be some equanimity over the team,\xe2\x80\x9d was the conclusion of the former Holland coach Bert van Marwijk.</p> <p>Hiddink said on camera later he wanted a discussion about the way Dutch footballers are developed, because he saw clear physical shortcomings. Another problem according to the 67-year-old: \xe2\x80\x9cWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get Robben to the ball early enough.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>When the NOS-interviewer Jack van Gelder asked if the Oranje amounts to little more than Robben, Hiddink agreed. Only three months after Holland were praised as being the best team, there is apparently nothing left, one player aside.</p> <p>A player who had an assiduous vision in Reykjavik. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think we are good, because we are not good. We don\xe2\x80\x99t belong to the best countries. We have to work terribly hard to be good and have be very critical of ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>After four matches under the friendly uncle, it\xe2\x80\x99s the fourth time this conclusion has been made. More and more it seems clear this Oranje class cannot go without their tough schoolteacher.</p>'
