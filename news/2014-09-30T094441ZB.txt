b'<p>There is always a temptation in football to look at what you could have won. In these days of frenzied movement between clubs, careers have a whiff of the choose-your-own-adventure \xe2\x80\x93 with the pot of gold and the pit of dragons lying just a judicious turn of the page from one another.</p> <p>It is never that simple. But when he looks along the touchline at Basel\xe2\x80\x99s St Jakob Park on Wednesday night, the home side\xe2\x80\x99s manager Paulo Sousa will be reminded that, sometimes, the wrong choice might not prove calamitous. That is despite the fact that he will see his Liverpool counterpart Brendan Rodgers, the man who picked up the pieces at Swansea City in July 2010 when the Portuguese, having led an improving side to seventh in the Championship, decided that Leicester City and his friend Milan Mandaric were a better bet to shoot for the stars.</p> <p>Sousa lasted 86 days at the King Power Stadium before being sacked. He had now gone through three second-tier clubs in under two years, and black marks of that severity have proved indelible for some managers. In May 2011, Rodgers and Swansea were celebrating promotion at Wembley; the subsequent momentum would be inexorable for both. Sousa had moved on by then: three weeks previously he had settled for the relative obscurity of the Hungarian league, with Videoton.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWith hindsight, yes, of course I made a mistake in leaving Swansea,\xe2\x80\x9d Sousa tells the Guardian. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the time I felt that moving to Leicester offered me the best opportunity for my career. We all make mistakes in life, but it is what you do next that counts.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Moving to Hungary was bold but clever. Videoton had just been crowned champions and offered a platform for instant success; they would finish second under Sousa but he won two domestic cup competitions and, in 2012-13, took them to the Europa League group stage. There, he claimed the scalps of Sporting Lisbon and \xe2\x80\x93 notably \xe2\x80\x93 Basel. A subsequent season with Maccabi Tel Aviv was no less obscure but equally fruitful: an Israeli league title and the narrowest of 4-3 aggregate defeats to Basel, again, in the Champions League qualifiers were further suggestion that Sousa, a Champions League winner with Juventus and Borussia Dortmund in the 1990s and one of that decade\xe2\x80\x99s cleverest deep midfielders, could meet high expectations in the dugout.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAfter things didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out at Leicester I had a break from the game, watched matches and studied styles of play, tactics and continued my coaching education,\xe2\x80\x9d explains Sousa. \xe2\x80\x9cI think the break helped me.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy 18 months with Videoton helped me discover my winning mentality. Then we went one step further with Maccabi. Those two and a half years were crucial for me. I had no problem with going to less well-known leagues. I think it is important for a coach to have success because it justifies his methods and approach, and success creates a positive atmosphere.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>For Basel, Sousa\xe2\x80\x99s performances as opposition manager in successive seasons were evidence enough that his modus operandi was a suitable substitute for Murat Yakin, who now coaches Spartak Moscow.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think that the club saw what I could do as a manager, with a team with a modest budget. We [Maccabi] played well against Basel over the two legs and made them work hard for their victory,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSo yes, the next step was appealing to me. Basel is a great club and they match my ambitions. I have been welcomed by everyone and I want to repay the club\xe2\x80\x99s faith with success \xe2\x80\x93 that is my motivation and my challenge.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It is, for all the Swiss league\xe2\x80\x99s modesty, a step up. Basel are watched by crowds whose fervour makes a mockery of cliches about the nation\xe2\x80\x99s reserve. They have played group stage football in four of the last six seasons, and beat Chelsea at St Jakob Park last year. Competing to the end in a group that also includes Real Madrid and Ludogorets would perhaps be vindication to those who, after Sousa\xe2\x80\x99s failure at Leicester, wondered whether his playing reputation might just have preceded him.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to be successful domestically, but we also want to compete in European football so that we can have the likes of Real Madrid and Liverpool here on a regular basis,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter that, the target is to beat them and to reach the knockout stages. If we can do that this season then great, but it is early days.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>A 5-1 defeat at the Bernab\xc3\xa9u two weeks ago does not augur well, although Sousa points out that his team had 16 shots at goal. He also stresses that his side is more of a work in progress than Yakin\xe2\x80\x99s of a year ago, which could call upon key players such as the now-departed Valentin Stocker and Yann Sommer. But he knows that a positive result could reintroduce him into the thoughts of a country where his business appears far from finished \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cright club, wrong time,\xe2\x80\x9d he says of his ill-fated first club position at Queens Park Rangers. He points out that a figure equally well known in England and Switzerland has proved the merit of trying again when at first you do not succeed.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLook at Roy Hodgson,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI played under him for Internazionale; he has managed international teams, managed clubs sides across Europe and then came back to English football and eventually managed his country. If managers have difficulties, or perceived failures in their careers, it is important to take time to plan your next decision, rebuild, try somewhere else and continue to progress.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Sousa recognises a kindred spirit in Rodgers (\xe2\x80\x9cAll of the managers who have worked under Huw Jenkins at Swansea in recent years have had a similar approach\xe2\x80\x9d) and does not attempt to claim credit for laying any of the foundations he worked from in south Wales. There is satisfaction enough that they can now stand together and that, even if he took the long way around, Sousa has selected his most recent adventures well.</p>'
