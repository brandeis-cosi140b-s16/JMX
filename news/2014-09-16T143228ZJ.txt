b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho: Eden Hazard can be one of the greats of his generation'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has claimed Eden Hazard can establish himself as \xe2\x80\x9cone of the greats of his generation\xe2\x80\x9d with Chelsea confident they will agree a new long-term contract with the Belgium international over the coming weeks.</p> <p>Hazard was one of the London club\xe2\x80\x99s most consistent performers last season with Mourinho pointing to the steady progress made by the 23-year-old in terms of developing tactical awareness and accepting defensive duties over his first year working with the player. Yet that education is far from complete and the manager had been publicly critical of the Belgian\xe2\x80\x99s failure to track back and check a run by Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s Juanfran in the second leg of the Champions League semi-final in April, an error which cost his team an equaliser.</p> <p>That was a reminder that this is a long-term process as Mourinho prepares to throw Hazard back into the competition in Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s opening Group G fixture against Schalke. \xe2\x80\x9cEden means a lot to us because he\xe2\x80\x99s a fantastic player,\xe2\x80\x9d said the manager. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are feeling day by day his motivation to work hard and improve. We have big hopes that he will go from the top player he is at this moment and will reach higher levels to become one of the best. Even last season his was a big evolution from the Hazard I met in Thailand [pre-season] when I arrived. He was a kid always living on his amazing natural talent.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut from a certain moment he started to have some tactical education, some mental education,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho added. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s been a big improvement. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re seeing he\xe2\x80\x99s a top talent, a fantastic player. But now we want, because his talent allows him to, is to go from a top player to one of the greats of his generation. That\xe2\x80\x99s what we think he can achieve, and why we\xe2\x80\x99re proud that he thinks that Chelsea is the perfect environment for him to undertake that evolution. That\xe2\x80\x99s why he wants to commit to us, and why we want him to commit for the future, too. It\xe2\x80\x99s true Chelsea are trying to have an agreement over a new contract, and that he wants to stay and commit for a few more years. It\xe2\x80\x99s a question of time before he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a new contract.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The deal should mean Hazard commands a weekly salary in the region of \xc2\xa3200,000, ensuring he remains among the highest earners at Stamford Bridge, with the playmaker expected to start against a Schalke team horribly weakened by injuries, shorn of confidence after their worst start to a season in 46 years and still bruised by Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s 4-1 thrashing at Borussia M\xc3\xb6nchengladbach. They will collide with a Chelsea side in scintillating form with Mourinho convinced his team are far stronger this season than last, when they finished third in the Premier League and reached the semi-finals of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s elite competition.</p> <p>The manager, bolstered by a fully fit squad, had claimed the Champions League for Porto and Internazionale in his second years in charge at those clubs, albeit having won the respective domestic league titles in Portugal and Italy the previous year. \xe2\x80\x9cBut England is a different contest. Is the third or fourth English team in the table better than almost every champion in Europe? Yes, no doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mourinho, who is attempting to become the first manager to win the European Cup for three different clubs. \xe2\x80\x9cThe competition is a different competition. But Porto was my second season, and Inter also my second season, and I think the second season is a privileged place to have the team in such good conditions.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cObviously there are teams and managers who work 10 or 15 years with the same team, and step by step with conditions to improve all the time. But I think the second season is a good space for evolution, for improvement. It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to improve on what we did last season in terms of the table or the Champions League, but I think we are a better team. We are far from perfection but we\xe2\x80\x99re a better group in better condition and playing better football.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe tournament is part of my history. I am part of the tournament\xe2\x80\x99s history. It\xe2\x80\x99s simple. If I win it once more, to win with three clubs is unique. Even if I don\xe2\x80\x99t do it, how many top managers in the world have only one or even not a single one? You have the example of [Sir Alex Ferguson], the greatest in our country who won it twice. Even if, from this moment, I don\xe2\x80\x99t win a single match in the Champions League, my history is there. I won it twice and that\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic, and something of which to be proud. But do I want to try and win it again? Of course I do. I have so many years ahead of me in terms of career. Obviously I have the ambition to win it again.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut in this moment, I only think about not playing in the Europa League. I want my club to succeed in the group stage. It would be very bad for the evolution of the group and the players to go into the Europa League, and for the club\xe2\x80\x99s prestige. Chelsea are not about the Europa League. We have to do everything we can to qualify for the knockout phase.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
