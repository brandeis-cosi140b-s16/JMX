b'Five reasons why Sunderland have stayed in the Premier League | Louise Taylor'


b'<p>Dick Advocaat has presided over the collection of 12 points from eight games since succeeding Gus Poyet at Sunderland. Back in March many Wearsiders felt the switch had come too late and relegation was inevitable, so how did the 67-year-old former Holland coach reach the point where tears of joy rolled down his face at Arsenal on Wednesday night?</p> 1 The introduction of a more attacking mindset <p>Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s excessive caution frequently featured the use of a lone striker in a 4-1-4-1 formation but Advocaat\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of 4-3-3 involves the deployment of three outright strikers \xe2\x80\x93 typically Jermain Defoe, Danny Graham \xe2\x80\x93 or Steven Fletcher \xe2\x80\x93 and Connor Wickham. By defying the convention that front threes comprise two attacking midfielders and one striker, Sunderland have unnerved opponents.</p> 2 Quicker buildup play and ensuring more bodies are in the box <p>As befits a Dutchman, Advocaat can be a bit sniffy about long-ball tactics but, without turning Sunderland into a kick-and-rush outfit, he has still made them considerably more direct than under Poyet. Whereas much of the passing was ponderous, aimless and either sideways or backwards on the Uruguayan\xe2\x80\x99s watch, it is now infinitely crisper, with the ball being moved forward appreciably quicker. Whereas Poyet was reluctant to permit too many bodies to advance into the opposing penalty area lest Sunderland came undone on the counterattack, Advocaat favours faster attacks complemented by the arrival of more players into the box.</p>     Advocaat pays thanks to the heroics of his Sunderland goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon at the Emirates.

Poyet, though, used him a quasi-sweeper, protecting a slow, ageing central defence. While Advocaat recognises the importance of Cattermole\xe2\x80\x99s defensive midfield qualities he also knows his passing is much underrated and has offered his enforcer licence to surge forward at appropriate moments.</p> 4 The introduction of Jones and Coates to a defence in which Van Aanholt became increasingly important <p>Poyet always seemed suspicious of attacking full-backs and would only ever field one in Patrick van Aanholt. While the left-back\xe2\x80\x99s rapid acceleration and crossing ability was welcome in a team horribly low on pace, the Uruguayan refused to risk fielding the similarly offensive Billy Jones at right-back. One of Advocaat\xe2\x80\x99s first acts was to introduce Jones to the first team and encourage him and Jones to put the opposition under pressure. Whereas Santiago Vergini was a Poyet favourite \xe2\x80\x93 either at right-back or centre-half \xe2\x80\x93 the Argentinian has fallen out of favour under his successor, with Sebasti\xc3\xa1n Coates impressing at centre-half after being drafted in to replace the injured Wes Brown. On loan from Liverpool, the Uruguayan rarely got a look in under his compatriot but now not only looks assured but has helped raise John O\xe2\x80\x99Shea\xe2\x80\x99s game.</p>           Advocaat refuses to be drawn on future    5 Much-improved communication, emotional stability, a positive mindset and the promotion of club harmony <p>A clear, concise communicator, possessing an understated humour, Advocaat leaves his players completely clear as to precisely what he requires. In contrast, Poyet could be somewhat muddled and contradictory at times. Like his predecessor, Paolo Di Canio, he was a volatile character prone to dramatic mood swings. A much calmer personality, Advocaat has cut a much more stable, consistent, figure.</p> <p>While, technically, Poyet won plaudits as a fine coach, the Uruguayan\xe2\x80\x99s failure to hide his dismay at the limitations of several of his players and his willingness to lament a \xe2\x80\x9clack of quality\xe2\x80\x9d in front of the media did not enhance morale or confidence. Advocaat is aware Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s squad is flawed but has refused to criticise anyone in public, instead suggesting his players had underachieved recently and possessed the ability to do better.</p> <p>Similarly, the Dutchman fully appreciates Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s immense potential and believes a club currently attracting the sixth highest crowds in the Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 even seventh-placed Chelsea are not quite as big a draw \xe2\x80\x93 should be challenging at the opposite end of the table.</p> <p>With Poyet there was always a sense he was working a ticket back to London and he was overly prone to belittling the north east. Quite apart from moaning about the weather, he claimed, entirely erroneously and at various times, that the area lacked cinemas, theatres, restaurants and hospitals and appeared, falsely, to believe any player signing for Sunderland would inevitably sacrifice quality of life.</p> <p>Whereas the club had become something of a political minefield in the past couple of years, Advocaat has restored harmony. A believer in the director of football role \xe2\x80\x93 and who knows how it works \xe2\x80\x93 he has forged an excellent relationship with Lee Congerton, Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s sporting director, who frequently seemed engaged in a civil war with Poyet, as well as Ellis Short, the owner.</p>'
