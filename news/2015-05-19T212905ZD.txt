b'Dick Advocaat keeps Sunderland in the dark while staying up is all'


b'<p>Dick Advocaat will wait until next week before telling Sunderland whether he wants to remain in the manager\xe2\x80\x99s chair for next season or retire.</p> <p>Although the 67-year-old Dutchman\xe2\x80\x99s contract at the Stadium of Light was originally intended to be strictly short-term he has impressed Ellis Short, Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s owner, and Lee Congerton, the sporting director, since succeeding Gus Poyet in March.</p> <p>Yet, if it appears the board may be willing to shelve plans to hire a younger coach this summer in order to stick with the former Holland manager, Advocaat has still to make his intentions clear.</p> <p>Only last week he dropped strong hints about staying on but the past few days have seen reports in the Netherlands suggesting his wife will not countenance him accepting a new deal on Wearside.</p> <p>As he prepared for Wednesday night\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Arsenal \xe2\x80\x93 where Sunderland require a point to guarantee their Premier League survival \xe2\x80\x93 Advocaat seemed to be quite enjoying keeping everyone guessing. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not made a decision yet on my future,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not given Sunderland an answer, either one way or another. I will not do that until next week when I will let them know. Nobody knows yet what I will do.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut so far I have really enjoyed it here. I have been linked with a job at Rangers \xe2\x80\x93 [as a potential director of football at his old club] \xe2\x80\x93 this week but that\xe2\x80\x99s wrong. I went up there and visited their training ground. That\xe2\x80\x99s the link but the story is wrong. Sunderland will definitely be my last job.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Advocaat could well name Adam Johnson in his starting XI at the Emirates. During his seven games in charge he has consistently used the former England winger as a substitute but suggested that could change against Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s side.</p> <p>Whether he starts or not, Johnson will arrive at the Emirates little more than 48 hours after his appearance at a case management hearing at Peterlee magistrates court where his solicitor indicated he would deny three charges of sexual activity with a girl under 16 and one of grooming.</p>     Dick Advocaat is considering handing Adam Johnson, left, a start in Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s penultimate game of the season at Arsenal on Wednesday. Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAdam is a player who can do something different for us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Advocaat, who has presided over the collection of 11 points from seven games. \xe2\x80\x9cHis style is different from the others.\xe2\x80\x9d With Hull, particularly, and Newcastle United in even greater jeopardy of relegation, the probability is that Sunderland will survive regardless but real risk remains and Advocaat would prefer not to visit Chelsea on Sunday still seeking that elusive point.</p> <p>Not that his demeanour will betray any nerves. \xe2\x80\x9cA relegation battle is new for me and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it. I\xe2\x80\x99m used to working at a higher level, challenging for Championships and cups. But I learned a long time ago never to show signs of pressure,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must always enjoy the situation, whatever it is, and this is what we must do at Arsenal. It\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful stadium and a great pitch - what more do you want?</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think every player enjoys playing at Chelsea and Arsenal. We have nothing to lose because everyone expects us to lose \xe2\x80\x93 except us. I know we will give both of them a really difficult time.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Whether he remains at the helm or not, Advocaat will be disappointed to see Sunderland feature in future relegation battles. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is potential at this club,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI know the owner and, like me, he wants Sunderland to be at the other end of the table. When I see what has happened in the past here, things can be done much better.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
