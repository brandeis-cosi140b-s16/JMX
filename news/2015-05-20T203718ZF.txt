b'Former Charlton player Richard Rufus in court over alleged financial wrongdoing'


b'<p>The former Charlton Athletic defender Richard Rufus has appeared at the high court accused of financial wrongdoing involving millions of pounds.</p> <p>Rufus was declared bankrupt in October 2013 after a failed investment scheme and is at the centre of a financial probe alleging misappropriation of funds and the unregulated taking of deposits. A civil trial into the matter will be held after 24 June and the former Premier League player was ordered not to trade in other people\xe2\x80\x99s money until then.</p> <p>The official receiver is attempting to secure a bankruptcy restriction order that would prevent the 40-year-old from being a manager or director of a limited company. Rufus came out of bankruptcy last year but the Insolvency Service is pursuing the case against him.</p> <p>Rufus, who represented himself in court, was given 14 days by registrar John Briggs to compile his evidence before a hearing. Judge Briggs said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say about using \xc2\xa33.5m of other people\xe2\x80\x99s funds for your own benefit?\xe2\x80\x9d Rufus refused to answer without consulting a lawyer.</p> <p>One of the individuals allegedly owed money by Rufus is Paul Elliott, the former Chelsea defender and a member of the Football Association\xe2\x80\x99s inclusion advisory board. Elliott stepped down from a previous role with the FA and anti-discrimination organisation Kick It Out in 2013 after a text message exchange with Rufus became public, with the contents described as \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory abusive comments\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Rufus, a former England Under-21 international, was voted Charlton\xe2\x80\x99s best ever defender in 2005 and is a born-again Christian.</p>'
