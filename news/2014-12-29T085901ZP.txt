b'Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend\xe2\x80\x99s action'


b'1) Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s front-to-back thinking proves he is young at heart <p>There are few things more interesting right now in the Premier League than Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s defence, which resembles in its ever-changing cast and shape a kind of footballing modern jazz, all trills and twirls and unexpected zig-zags, a new trombonist here, an unexpected xylophone man over there. If United\xe2\x80\x99s defence was unchanged at White Hart Lane, it was still a slightly odd-looking thing, with three career centre halves (average age, 22) and a pair of converted wing-backs.</p> <p>It is tempting to suggest in Phil Jones and Paddy McNair, Van Gaal has finally achieved some balance: a defender who makes mistakes because he\xe2\x80\x99s too rash, paired with a defender who makes mistakes because he\xe2\x80\x99s too timid. And yet for all that, United kept a clean sheet against Spurs and have now conceded just five goals in their last 10 matches, a tribute to David De Gea\xe2\x80\x99s excellence and to the resourcefulness of the players.</p> <p>Most notably, Ashley Young has been a quiet revelation as a left wing-back and left-back. Against Spurs Young was again mobile, determined and always ready to skate forward down his wing and attack with craft and intent.</p> <p>One of the best things about Van Gaal managing in England, so far, has been his ability to persuade even established players to take on new roles. The resurrection of Young\xe2\x80\x99s Old Trafford career, set in train on the pre-season tour of America, is a genuine plus. It is no doubt just a quirk that United have not lost since the opening day of the season with Young in the team. There is also perhaps a slight disadvantage in being right footed when making those overlapping runs.</p> <p>But whatever happens from here, Young deserves credit for the rare achievement among English footballers of being willing enough, and astute enough, to reinvent himself late in his career. Barney Ronay</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Tottenham 0-0 Manchester United\xe2\x80\xa2 Barney Ronay: Wayne v Kane showdown falls flat\xe2\x80\xa2 The Dozen: Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s best Premier League photos</p>            Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s match against Tottenham was a \xe2\x80\x98struggle for life\xe2\x80\x99, says Louis van Gaal.     2) Mourinho uses \xe2\x80\x98campaign\xe2\x80\x99 speech to Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s advantage               <p>He\xe2\x80\x99s clever, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be fooled into thinking he believed every single word of that impassioned outburst about the \xe2\x80\x9ccampaign\xe2\x80\x9d against Chelsea and, best of all, his complaint that if they do have a reputation for diving it is entirely the fault of everyone else. He knows the power of his own voice. Sir Alex Ferguson used to do something similar at Manchester United: go on the attack, manipulate the headlines, create the siege mentality and get in the minds of the referees, whether it was based on hard facts or not.</p> <p>So all the emphasis since Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s draw at Southampton has been on his perception that his players are being unfairly targeted and that \xe2\x80\x9cit is clearly the result of something that looks like a campaign\xe2\x80\x9d. It takes the emphasis away from a slightly laboured attacking performance but, more importantly, it plants a seed for the rest of the season. And this is the strategy: by going public, by having that force of personality and the knowledge of how it will dominate the agenda, Mourinho has not just defended his club (justifiably in the Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas case) but created the situation where it would need a brave referee to issue a yellow card the next time this happens. The injustice of F\xc3\xa0bregas\xe2\x80\x99s booking, when there had clearly been a trip from Matt Targett, accidental or not, certainly gave Mourinho the platform to put his club forward as being harshly done by, even if he made it sound like a recurring theme rather than an event that has happened twice in four months.</p> <p>Mourinho was perfectly entitled to cite Diego Costa\xe2\x80\x99s yellow card against Burnley in their first match of the season, when the alleged dive was actually Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s striker being taken down by the opposition goalkeeper. There is always more scrutiny on the top clubs and maybe it is true, as Mourinho says, that something that the same, or worse, frequently happens at less newsworthy clubs.</p> <p>Where it falls down is the portfolio of other occasions, going back to last season as well, when Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s players have exaggerated or in some cases concocted the level of contact from opponents to try to win free-kicks or penalties. Various journalists reminded Mourinho of recent examples such as Gary Cahill\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSwan Lake\xe2\x80\x9d act, to quote Steve Bruce, against Hull City. Yet Mourinho, being Mourinho, would not give an inch. Branislav Ivanovic against West Ham? \xe2\x80\x9cDid you see the game against West Ham? There was one dive: [Enner] Valencia.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>OK, what about the three diving offences against Hull? \xe2\x80\x9cSpeak the same way against all teams and not just one,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho shot back. Reminded of the five yellow cards that have gone to Chelsea players for simulation, Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s eyes flashed with anger. \xe2\x80\x9cBad yellow cards,\xe2\x80\x9d he seethed.</p> <p>The use of the word \xe2\x80\x9ccampaign\xe2\x80\x9d might interest the Football Association\xe2\x80\x99s disciplinary department if Mourinho meant it came from the referees. But when he was asked to explain what he meant he made it sound like it was actually the whole of football who were against the Premier League leaders.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFor example, after the game versus West Ham, Valencia made a very bad dive at the end of the game and Sam Allardyce is talking about Ivanovic. What is this? What? Why? Which intention? And today you come here, one of these matches between two good teams, difficult match, crucial decisions and the ref makes a wrong decision. I just say the referee made a mistake. Not more than that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho talked for so long about the same issue that eventually the club\xe2\x80\x99s media official had to ask for the subject to be changed. And, ultimately, his work was done. The story had shifted. Mourinho could point to the television evidence to back up his theory and if referees did feel suspicious about Chelsea players because maybe that had now flipped to their advantage for next time.

The German intends to hold talks with Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger before the transfer window opens in the new year but those discussions are likely to confirm a loan move to Internazionale next month, with his dissatisfaction at life on the bench all too clear.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot afford to sit around waiting for my chance,\xe2\x80\x9d he had said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am 29 and I want to play, play and play. I am not crazy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to sit in the stands.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Juventus and Borussia Dortmund are also apparently interested, though Inter \xe2\x80\x93 who play Paris Saint-Germain in a friendly in Morocco on Monday \xe2\x80\x93 held talks with Arsenal over the weekend as they discussed a \xc2\xa31.5m loan fee and hope to confirm his arrival on a six-month temporary deal after the game at Southampton on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s day.</p> <p>Wenger did little to dismiss the notion that Podolski\xe2\x80\x99s career in London is coming to an end. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing concrete there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the manager. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd, at the moment, nobody goes out. But we have Mesut \xc3\x96zil coming back in January, so we will have a lot of competition up front.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The player, a \xc2\xa310.5m signing from Cologne in 2012, has one more year to run on his contract at the Emirates stadium though a successful spell in Italy is likely to pave the way for a permanent departure.</p> <p>His absence will surely affect how Wenger deals with the \xe2\x80\x9ccompetition\xe2\x80\x9d for forward roles. \xc3\x96zil can operate in the position Podolski craves and, even with Olivier Giroud to sit out the game at Southampton and the FA Cup third-round tie against Hull through suspension, the German has effectively been usurped by others. Danny Welbeck, who scored his first goal in a month at Upton Park, is already an integral part of this team. Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez has been outstanding since arriving from Barcelona. Santi Cazorla has now scored four in five games.</p> <p>Yet Podolski\xe2\x80\x99s departure will have implications for others. It is doubtful Yaya Sanogo will be loaned to Crystal Palace following their change of manager over the weekend, but any other potential temporary switch may also now be shelved with the youngster providing cover. The same may apply for Joel Campbell who, like Podolski, was another unused substitute at West Ham. Dominic Fifield</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: West Ham 1-2 Arsenal\xe2\x80\xa2 Premier League wishlists: who to buy in January? </p>               4) Pardew plays games of intrigue over the Palace job  <p>Is it all a game intended to extract more money and assurances from Mike Ashley or does he want to go? Sometimes actions really do speaker louder than words and Alan Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s body-swerving of post match media durites following the 3-2 win against Everton fuelled all manner of suggestions he was on the brink of stepping into the chair so recently vacated by Neil Warnock at Crystal Palace.</p> <p>Would you really swap managing Newcastle United and their 52,000 regular home crowds for a certain relegation scrap at a significantly smaller club, albeit one close to your heart. Or have the charms of working for the ever idiosyncratic Ashley finally worn thin?</p> <p>And should Palace spend \xc2\xa36m which could be invested in players on Pardew?</p> <p>Only time will tell but for the moment there there are only questions \xe2\x80\x93 and Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s manager is not minded to answer them. Louise Taylor</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Newcastle 3-2 EvertonScudamore admits Premier League youth lags behind Bundesliga</p>            Brendan Rodgers predicts strong finish to the season for Liverpool.    5) Jury is out on Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s dear defender Mangala   <div data-embed-type="table" class="player-card player-card--football" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <div class="player-card__image-container">  </div> <div class="player-card__player"> <div class="player-card__position" itemprop="jobTitle">Defender</div> <div class="player-card__name" itemprop="name">Eliaquim Mangala</div> </div> <dl class="player-card__stats"> <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Appearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">10</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots blocked</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">7</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Clearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">77</dd> </dl> </div>   <p>Has Eliaquim Mangala yet to validate the \xc2\xa340m fee paid by Manchester City for his transfer from Porto? In Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 2-2 draw with Burnley the Frenchman again struggled, appearing vulnerable under the high ball \xe2\x80\x93 a quaint weakness for such a towering man \xe2\x80\x93 and sluggish and unconfident. Asked about the 23-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s display, the City manager, Manuel Pellegrini, was forced to bring out the straight-bat, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t analyse individual performances. I always analyse the performance of the team. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Burnley really had too many chances to score. They scored the goals they need. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is just the fault of one player.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The last bit was correct, though a touch disingenuous as the question was not if the failure to win was Mangala\xe2\x80\x99s fault but whether he had struggled. He cost the club \xc2\xa340m, which would be a high price even for a top- class striker. Those who seek mitigation will cite the need for time to adjust. Others, conversely, might argue that for such a cost a player halfway thorough an inaugural Premier League campaign should now consistently be displaying his undoubted talent.</p> <p>The jury, then, remains out... Jamie Jackson</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Manchester City 2-2 Burnley\xe2\x80\xa2 Pellegrini bemoans City\xe2\x80\x99s complacency after draw</p>               <p>6) Redknapp needs loan stars to lift Loftus Road</p> <p>Harry Redknapp said after his side\xe2\x80\x99s grim goalless draw with Crystal Palace that his squad needs three new players in January, stressing the urgency of signing at least one striker to alleviate the scoring burden on Charlie Austin. Creative midfielders must be high on his wish-list too, as there was a dire lack of ingenuity on display against Palace, with hoofs in the general direction of Bobby Zamora being the default tactic. With the Queens Park Rangers owners tightening their belts, Redknapp will only be allowed to borrow players rather than buy them. Convincing a club to lend players of the quality required will need someone at Loftus Road to show more imagination and resourcefulness than the team displayed against Palace in a performance that raised fears that their home form risks emulating their away form. Paul Doyle</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: QPR 0-0 Crystal Palace\xe2\x80\xa2 Dominic Fifield: Time running out for Palace to make real leap of faith</p>  7) Stoke\xe2\x80\x99s frugal, patient progress is paying off <p>Crystal Palace were the first relegation-threatened team to blink, but that has only increased the pressure on Neil Warnock\xe2\x80\x99s former colleagues \xe2\x80\x93 not least West Bromwich Albion\xe2\x80\x99s Alan Irvine, who oversaw a 2-0 defeat to Stoke that leaves him favourite to be the next to fall.</p> <p>Stoke did not have to be exceptional, but won with a comfort that many below the mid-table Potters would relish, particularly in the middle of a frantic festive schedule. Mark Hughes\xe2\x80\x99s side are now nine points clear of trouble and set fair for an eighth straight top-flight campaign \xe2\x80\x93 despite a summer net spend of just under half a million pounds. That\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa324.5 million less than Hull, and even \xc2\xa37.5 million less than parsimonious Burnley.</p> <p>For that outlay, Hughes acquired Mame Biram Diouf, Bojan Krkic, and five others ranging from the dependable Phil Bardsley to the anonymous Dionotan Teixeira. Stoke were without four of these seven signings on Sunday, but won thanks to Diouf\xe2\x80\x99s brace, coupled with a solid defensive display from a settled side. Retaining Asmir Begovic and Ryan Shawcross has proved far more important than any new arrivals \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps there is a lesson there, with January fast approaching.</p> <p>It has hardly been an overnight success for Stoke under Hughes. They started 2014 in 12th, and it is likely they\xe2\x80\x99ll finish it in 10th. That said, for a manager who gained a reputation for wasting wads of cash \xe2\x80\x93 first at Manchester City, then at QPR \xe2\x80\x93 Stoke\xe2\x80\x99s frugal, patient progress away from the spotlight will be especially pleasing. Niall McVeigh</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Stoke 2-0 West Brom</p>  8) About that winter break... <p>Paul Lambert and Gus Poyet were not exactly full of festive cheer at the end of a predictable stalemate. Both managers were united in their criticism of a schedule that sees two games played in the space of three days. Poyet described it as a \xe2\x80\x9cdisgrace\xe2\x80\x9d in the lead up to the Boxing Day match against Hull and he needed no encouragement to continue his calls for the introduction of a winter break after the goalless draw at Villa Park.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFrank Leboeuf said in 1997: \xe2\x80\x98England needs to stop.\xe2\x80\x99 And every single one of you killed him and said \xe2\x80\x98if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like it go back to France\xe2\x80\x99. Now I can see a few managers, British, saying we need to stop as well. I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased with that,\xe2\x80\x9d the Sunderland manager said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think football will be better, the quality for the fans will be better and the national team will be better. We should extend the season. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got too much holidays. I came from Spain where the maximum I had was a month. The first year at Chelsea, when they said I had eight weeks [off], I went: \xe2\x80\x98I love England!\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s too much, you could spend that extra month to play the games. If you want I can plan it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Lambert, who knows the value of taking a breather mid-season from his time as a player with Borussia Dortmund, was singing from the same hymn sheet. \xe2\x80\x9cI agree with Gus 100% on what he said the other day,\xe2\x80\x9d the Villa manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re trying to sell a product and two games in three days is nonsense. There is no quality with that. I understand the game on Boxing Day, because that\xe2\x80\x99s tradition, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go and play two days later \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s not normal. I played in Germany, I had a winter break from December to February, so I know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like. It\xe2\x80\x99s common sense. If you have a break, it galvanises everybody. You\xe2\x80\x99re asking lads to play two games in three days, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking supporters to come out in horrendous weather.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>To add insult to injury, those bitterly cold fans at Villa Park were not even treated to a goal on Sunday \xe2\x80\x93 a familiar theme for both clubs this season. Stuart James</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Aston Villa 0-0 Sunderland</p>  9) Saints give Reed chance to clean up against Arsenal <p>Whether Ronald Koeman opts for a 3-5-2 or a 4-4-2 against Arsenal on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, the absence of Morgan Schneiderlin will hit Southampton hard \xe2\x80\x93 the Frenchman is suspended for the match after picking up his fifth booking of the season (and his first of two) in the 1-1 draw with Chelsea.</p> <p>Alongside Victor Wanyama, Schneiderlin expertly patrols the space in front of Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s defence, exactly the area that Arsenal \xe2\x80\x93 Santi Cazorla and Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez in particular \xe2\x80\x93 are most dangerous in. With Jack Cork still sidelined, Schneiderlin\xe2\x80\x99s suspension probably means that Harrison Reed will get another chance to impress.</p> <p>Another product of Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s youth academy, the 19-year-old was excellent in his first start for the club nine days ago against out-of-form Everton and it would be fascinating to see if he can again live up to the nickname his team-mates have given him \xe2\x80\x93 Ray Donovan, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause he just cleans up in midfield\xe2\x80\x9d, according to Shane Long \xe2\x80\x93 in what should be a tougher test on Thursday. Michael Butler</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Football stadiums then and now \xe2\x80\x93 interactive quiz</p>  10) Can Leicester avoid relegation? <p>Nigel Pearson was assistant manager at West Brom when they avoided relegation from the Premier League in 2005, the first club to do so having been bottom of the division at Christmas.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere are going to be those sorts of questions,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pearson when asked whether Leicester could achieve a similar feat, in the aftermath of a 1-0 victory over Hull City that may yet be a turning point this season. Leicester are now three points behind Hull who are in 17th after Riyad Mahrez\xe2\x80\x99s winner at the KC Stadium, a first victory in 14 attempts. Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s side have played far better this season and emerged pointless, but on this occasion dug deep and rode their luck to avoid a defeat that could have proved disastrous. They remain bottom but are now in touch with their relegation rivals going into Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s fixture against Liverpool at Anfield, and will hope to gain momentum going into the new year.
