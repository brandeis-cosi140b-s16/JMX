b'<p>THE STORY OF A CHARMLESS MAN (PLUS A FIVER ED ADDENDUM)</p> <p>When Nigel Pearson commended his Leicester City players on their resilience in the face of constant criticism and negativity following Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s defeat at the hands of Chelsea, one young journalist asked him to provide some examples of all this non-existent carping to which he was alluding. As anyone who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had their head buried in the sand since the final whistle will almost certainly know, rather than answer the question there followed a strange and slightly sinister attempted takedown of the insolent hack, who Pearson compared to an ostrich, labelled \xe2\x80\x9cstupid\xe2\x80\x9d and went on to childishly mock before walking out in a huff. Nigel Pearson is 51.</p> <p>Reaction to Big Website\xe2\x80\x99s story detailing Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s weird outburst has been mixed, with more than a few readers taking to the accompanying comments section to sniffily wonder why Premier League Football Manager Has Meltdown In Press Conference even constitutes \xe2\x80\x9cnews\xe2\x80\x9d. Indeed, with a general election looming and all manner of far more interesting things going on in the world, our thanks go out to those people for taking their fingers off The Pulse for long enough to help rocket this tedious and in-no-way entertaining anecdote into the top 10 most-read articles across Big Website.</p> <p>Other readers have taken to the comments section to write in praise of Pearson and his juvenile bully-boy tactics in the face of a perfectly legitimate line of questioning from a young man trying to do his job for the benefit of people like them, which probably tells you all you need to know about the attitudes of many people who post anonymously on the internet. Unlike them, Pearson at least had the good grace to do his bullying in person, although he may regret his actions now he\xe2\x80\x99s seen how poorly they\xe2\x80\x99ve been been received.</p> <p>Long after the time of writing, the Leicester City manager was due to give another press conference ahead of his side\xe2\x80\x99s win over Newcastle this weekend, so we can only guess that he apologised for behaving like a sadistic PE teacher and hope that Fiver Ed adds a suitable addendum to this story accordingly. Of course there\xe2\x80\x99s also a very good chance Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s manager will have gone off another one, embarking on some strange metaphor involving other animal kingdom myths, such as that hoary classic about turkeys being so stupid they drown if left out in the rain. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like all the aspects of what I do and am, or things I\xe2\x80\x99ve done, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to live with it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pearson in a recent Big Paper interview. Live with it or bury your head in the sand.</p> <p>[Fiver Ed addendum: today in headlines you didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect to read \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98Leicester manager Nigel Pearson has apologised to the journalist who he called an ostrich.\xe2\x80\x99]</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe somersaulted three or four times before running up to the Bradford supporters, shaking his fist in a \xe2\x80\x98w@nker\xe2\x80\x99 gesture at them. He was taken off the pitch by stewards and arrested\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Louise Attrill, prosecuting, on football fan Charlie Sumner, who ran on to a pitch t0pless and performed some low-rent circus tricks during an FA Cup match, which today earned him a three-year banning order.</p>     \xe2\x80\x98Just look at his face \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99 Photograph: PA    FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf Nigel Pearson is as flexible as he says he is, he can probably put his head up his own backside, never mind the sand, which maybe explains why he talks out of it so often. I hope Leicester stay up, if only for the off-pitch entertainment\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Kevin Denham.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cContinuing the Daniel Sturridge-shaped hole theme further still (Fiver letters passim), surely the size, and not the shape, of the hole is the important factor here? I\xe2\x80\x99d argue that Daniel would struggle to \xe2\x80\x98fall through\xe2\x80\x99 a quarter-size facsimile of his lithe frame, yet could easily fit through a 10x-magnified holey representation of Ruel Fox or Andy Sinton\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 David Lambert.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: the Charlie Austin bin situation (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters). As a young Brentford fan I used to take great pleasure in suggesting that QPR stood for Quarter Pound o\xe2\x80\x99Rubbish (I thought this made sense/was amusing at the time). This seems somewhat more relevant now, albeit just as unfunny\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 James Thompson.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cCan I call dibs on all future shotgun-related issues [Fiver letters passim]?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ashley Gilbert.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
