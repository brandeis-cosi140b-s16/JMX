b'Everton v West Brom: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>A drab game in all honesty, but the major talking point will of course be that penalty and Kevin Miralles disobeying team orders to take the ball off Leighton Baines. It\xe2\x80\x99s all a bit Formula One though isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?</p>    <p>Be great if Mirallas runs in and hijacks Baines&#39;s post match interview.</p>&mdash; Anthony Richardson (@AmhRichardson) January 19, 2015    <p>However, whatever you think about it, Mirallas definitely wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been substituted had he scored. Cue lots of rumours linking him with the exit now \xe2\x80\x93 they\xe2\x80\x99ll mostly be poppycock. He\xe2\x80\x99s got 18 month on his contract too. He\xe2\x80\x99s one of the best players at Everton and without him in the second half, Everton struggled to break West Brom down, even though they had 68% possession. Gareth McAuley and Joleon Lescott were magnificent for West Brom, as was Claudio Yacob screening in front of the back four. </p> <p>Thanks for your tweets and emails tonight.
