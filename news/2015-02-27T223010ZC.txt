b'Christian Eriksen: We showed we can play against Chelsea and beat them'


b'<p>Christian Eriksen is used to pressure. The man who carries Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s hopes of a first trophy in seven years has been the darling of Danish football since a teenager, played in four finals with Ajax where he signed at 16 and used to lock his bedroom door after a bad game to avoid speaking with his father.</p> <p>He grew up shouldering the weight of a nation\xe2\x80\x99s expectation, proclaimed as the next Michael Laudrup, and has become accustomed to ever-present, hyperbolic epithets during a career that remains in its infancy. Eriksen, still only 23, has had to deal with such hype for many years. This season, though, he has certainly justified it.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI always had it, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned to live with it,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery player has a different style of play, has a different talent, so people look differently at you. But in the position I play, you need to have a bit of pressure. A lot of players who start young always get the comparison from other people, a bit older. Or the Danish newspapers with Laudrup \xe2\x80\xa6 but I\xe2\x80\x99ve been used to it from early on.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Perhaps it is little surprise, then, that the midfielder was a model of calmness in a seminal week in Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s season, one that has included a Europa League defeat in Florence and will end with a trip to Wembley, where the club\xe2\x80\x99s first silverware since Juande Ramos guided Spurs to a surprise League Cup success \xe2\x80\x93 against Chelsea, in 2008 \xe2\x80\x93 is in sight.</p> <p>Tottenham will need cool heads on Sunday. Their campaign took a major hit on Thursday in Italy following a performance littered with errors \xe2\x80\x93 in front of goal and in defence \xe2\x80\x93 as Mauricio Pochettino made seven changes to his side and paid the price in a 2-0 loss that will be remembered most of all for Roberto Soldado\xe2\x80\x99s howler.</p> <p>Eriksen played 90 minutes in that game and trained at Coverciano on Friday with the rest of the squad before returning to London, as thoughts turned to a season\xe2\x80\x91defining meeting with Chelsea.</p> <p>Eriksen has scored 11 goals this season, including crucial late efforts that have proved pivotal in the Premier League and Capital One Cup. He played in Spurs\xe2\x80\x99 rampant 5-3 victory over Chelsea on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, a result that exposed the vulnerabilities of the league leaders and one that provided the title race with a much-needed shot in the arm.</p> <p>Eriksen turned down the opportunity to sign for Chelsea as a teenager, at a time when Frank Arnesen, a fellow Dane, was the sporting director at Stamford Bridge. He had two separate trials at the club aged 14 and 15 \xe2\x80\x93 playing in youth matches against Millwall and West Ham \xe2\x80\x93 but eventually opted for Amsterdam, regarding it as a more gentle step up after three years with Odense. \xe2\x80\x9cIn England you can\xe2\x80\x99t enter the training ground without permission whereas in Denmark you are free to go in,\xe2\x80\x9d he says when explaining the thought-process behind his decision.</p> <p>It was a move that paid off and Eriksen will renew acquaintances with Chelsea knowing that Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s season is on the line. There remains the chance of a top-four finish in the Premier League but after their collapse against Fiorentina, the stakes at Wembley have been raised.</p> <p>Spurs can, though, take comfort from their remarkable success against Chelsea earlier in the campaign. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople just had happier faces,\xe2\x80\x9d Eriksen says of that victory. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was more smiling and everyone was just excited that we won. Maybe they [Chelsea] got a knock on their confidence because they had a lot of games when they were unbeaten.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe confidence we take from that game is the most important thing. We showed that we can play against them and beat them. We played a few games before where we tried and did not succeed, but we showed now that we can and that gives us a lot of confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Eriksen\xe2\x80\x99s nine league goals from midfield have accounted for 13 points this season. His late strikes against Hull City, Swansea City and Sunderland secured wins and, along with Harry Kane, he has been the man Pochettino has relied upon when the chips are down. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I\xe2\x80\x99ve become a better player, I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve just been more stable,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re young \xe2\x80\x93 I probably still am at 23, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel so young any more \xe2\x80\x93 you have your ups and downs. Luckily, there haven\xe2\x80\x99t been that many, of course there are still a few, but if you get those out I think I am still on the right path.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>With praise and superlatives, though, also comes criticism, a significant dose of which he received from Morten Olsen \xe2\x80\x93 the Denmark coach \xe2\x80\x93 last autumn following a Euro 2016 qualifier. In October, Olsen, presumably in an attempt to motivate Eriksen, said the midfielder was not making a sufficient impact at international level and that he had not progressed at Spurs, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not Ajax any more, this is not development.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Olsen\xe2\x80\x99s words had the intended effect. Since then Eriksen has been a revelation, producing excellent displays either centrally or out wide, and prompting the usual big-move speculation that comes with such form.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt didn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt,\xe2\x80\x9d he says of Olsen\xe2\x80\x99s criticism. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve grown up with that. We are a bit aggressive in that way, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard it before. I think he made the point a bit more for myself. He took it to the outside and also told me personally. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been used to that for a long time, that players want more because they think I can do better. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. The game after, I think it helped. It\xe2\x80\x99s the national manager, so I trust what he says.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9c[My dad] was a coach for me when I was seven to 13. He stayed as a coach on the sideline until I moved to Ajax. He was a footballer as well, so he knew a lot of things and he knew what he wanted. There were some times when I had a bad game, he would tell me to do better. Of course I have learned.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never thought about quitting. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been closing my door pretty hard after I spoke to him, locking the door to my room. But nothing else. So we have the discussion or he has the discussion with me, and I\xe2\x80\x99m listening. And then the day after, it\xe2\x80\x99s a new day and nothing happens. It\xe2\x80\x99s football.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Eriksen has not scored in February, a month that started with a memorable victory over Arsenal but has gradually declined since \xe2\x80\x93 as Spurs dropped back out of the top four. A win on Sunday, though, would vindicate Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s selection in Florence and, says Eriksen, provide Tottenham with a winning mentality going forward. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a few years ago [since] they won something here,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is what we want to do.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe have a really young team and everyone wants to show off and win something. You get a few chances but this is probably the biggest chance you get. If you get the feeling of winning, you want to have the feeling again. Everyone wants to have that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Christian Eriksen was speaking at a Tottenham Hotspur Foundation event highlighting the Education and Football Development Centre programme, which provides Academy-standard coaching alongside BTEC and FA level qualifications to create life changing opportunities to young people aged 16-18 not in education, employment or training.
