b'Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho: Uefa\xe2\x80\x99s FFP rules are a contradiction'


b'<p>The Chelsea manager, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho, has described Uefa\xe2\x80\x99s Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules as a contradiction which allow Europe\xe2\x80\x99s elite clubs to maintain the status quo.</p> <p>Chelsea spent almost \xc2\xa395m in the summer transfer window on new signings including Diego Costa and Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas but were able to post an overall profit after selling David Luiz, Romelu Lukaku and Demba Ba. In contrast, Champions League holders Real Madrid spent almost \xc2\xa3100m on new players this summer, while Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s spending almost broke the \xc2\xa3150m barrier after completing deals for \xc3\x81ngel di Mar\xc3\xada, Daley Blind and Ander Herrera among others.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think Financial Fair Play is a contradiction because, when football decided to go for Financial Fair Play it was exactly to put teams in equal conditions to compete,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho told Yahoo.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut what happened really with the Financial Fair Play is a big protection to the historical, old, big clubs, which have a financial structure, a commercial structure, everything in place based on historical success for years and years and years.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the \xe2\x80\x98new\xe2\x80\x99 clubs - I call them \xe2\x80\x98new\xe2\x80\x99 clubs, those with new investment - they cannot put themselves quickly at the same level. Clubs with new owners cannot immediately attack the control and the domination of these big clubs.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cChelsea is not an old, historical, huge club - but it\xe2\x80\x99s also not a club with a new owner. It\xe2\x80\x99s a club with the same owner for more than 10 years. A club with a very important history, with great stability too. And at this moment I think we are just below them. I can say we are a very good club with the ambition to be a great club.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>First agreed in principle in 2009 as a method of restricting spending among European clubs, FFP was introduced in the 2011-12 season. Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain were among the first teams to be sanctioned under the new rules this summer, with the English champions originally fined \xc2\xa349m for contravening rules.</p>'
