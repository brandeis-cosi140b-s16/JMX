b'Winston Bogarde: At Chelsea I was feeling hurt. It\xe2\x80\x99s terrible not to play'


b'<p>Winston Bogarde is smartly dressed in a black suit and looks well as he arrives early for our meeting on the outskirts of Amsterdam. Across the street is a small football pitch but there is no one playing. Bogarde takes his seat in a quiet area of the hotel restaurant and, for the first time in his life, opens up about the four notorious years at Chelsea.</p> <p>Wearing an expensive-looking watch and a ring on his wedding finger Bogarde is polite and smiles easily, though he offers glimpses of hurt and anxiety as the former Champions League, Eredivisie and La Liga winner is frank about the lost seasons that ended his career so sourly.</p> <p>Accompanied by his manager, he confesses to loneliness, despair, an understanding of why he is viewed as greedy and, most poignantly, regret. This is the regret caused by drawing a \xc2\xa340,000-a-week salary that earned him nearly \xc2\xa310m between 2000 and 2004 while making only 12 appearances for Chelsea.</p> <p>The first surprise is Bogarde is back in football, eager to be involved in a sport he virtually fell out of love with. \xe2\x80\x9cI am a trainer-coach,\xe2\x80\x9d the 44-year-old says.</p> <p>Louis van Gaal was Bogarde\xe2\x80\x99s great mentor, harnessing his talents as a tough defender at Ajax where he was part of the 1995 squad who won the Champions League, before later taking him to Barcelona. However, while Van Gaal is now the Manchester United manager, Bogarde is unemployed.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAt the moment I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a club,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, pausing for a moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m doing master classes in defence, individually, until I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get a job.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Winston Bogarde insists he would have loved to have gone on loan whilst at Chelsea, and says would have taken a 30% cut in wages. Photograph: Irina Popova for the Guardian    <p>The challenge, though, for Bogarde is to rebuild a shattered public image. On 31 August 2000 he was signed by Gianluca Vialli for Chelsea. At 29 this was the final big move of a high-flying career. However, on leaving Stamford Bridge in the summer of 2004, nearly two years had passed since he last kicked a ball. That appearance \xe2\x80\x93 his final as a professional \xe2\x80\x93 was on 6 November 2002, as a substitute in a 2-1 League Cup win over Gillingham. It was his only run-out of the 2002-03 season. In Bogarde\xe2\x80\x99s second and fourth years \xe2\x80\x93 2001-02 and 2003-04 \xe2\x80\x93 there were none. The best return was the 11 appearances of the first season, in which he made his four starts for the club.</p> <p>Bogarde came to represent the greedy, modern-day footballer. The conclusion was if he was desperate to play he would have agreed a loan move or cut a deal with Chelsea and been released. So, what did happen?</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cVialli bought me and when I had been there a week he got sacked,\xe2\x80\x9d Bogarde says of the Italian coach\xe2\x80\x99s removal on 12 September 2000. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to look who the new manager\xe2\x80\x99s going to be and if you\xe2\x80\x99re still going to get a chance.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Six days later Claudio Ranieri was appointed and hopes began to fade. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t play that much,\xe2\x80\x9d Bogarde says. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I was already like 30, 31. So I wanted to end my career good.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Winston Bogarde won the Champions League with Ajax in 1996 under current Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal.

My situation was not very good and we tried to solve it many ways. Like to maybe go on loan or sell me, or whatever. But in the end it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As he trails off I ask Bogarde if there was a particular fall-out with Ranieri. \xe2\x80\x9cNot fall-out. Sometimes you had situations when the manager is telling you: \xe2\x80\x98OK now you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get a fair chance\xe2\x80\x99. And two weeks later that changed,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI was feeling hurt as a player. If it was from him or the club, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know \xe2\x80\x93 it was very difficult to get a chance.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Bogarde says Trevor Birch\xe2\x80\x99s appointment as Chelsea chief executive in March 2002 sealed his fate. \xe2\x80\x9cCutting costs was his speciality. Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s a fantastic club and of course he only did his job. But sometimes you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with people and have to look for solutions \xe2\x80\x93 for the club, for the player. And we talked about those things. But they were very uncompromising.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Bogarde states he would have gone on loan but Chelsea insisted his full wage be paid. \xe2\x80\x9cA club could not pay my whole salary, they could maybe pay 70%,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd they asked Chelsea to pay the other 30% and Chelsea said: \xe2\x80\x98No. If you want to take him it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be 100% or nothing. He is going nowhere\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Bogarde claims he would have been content to take a 30% cut in wages. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course. For a player, for me, it\xe2\x80\x99s terrible not to play. Yet I had to return for training. Return looking for the next solution, you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Did Chelsea try to make him take a cut in his salary? \xe2\x80\x9cNo, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t try that,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.</p> <p>Bogarde, who is from Rotterdam, made his professional debut for Sparta Rotterdam in 1991 before joining Ajax three years later. An unused substitute by Van Gaal in the triumphant 1995 Champions League final \xe2\x80\x93 Milan were defeated 1-0 \xe2\x80\x93 Bogarde won two Eredivisie titles, the Uefa Super Cup and Intercontinental Cup before leaving for Milan in 1997. After half a season in Italy he rejoined Van Gaal at Barcelona in January 1998.</p>     Winston Bogarde, rear, was a substitute during Ajax\xe2\x80\x99s 1995 Champions League triumph. Action Images Photograph: Action Images    <p>At Camp Nou, Bogarde collected two La Liga winner\xe2\x80\x99s medals, the Copa del Rey and a second Uefa Super Cup while playing alongside some of the game\xe2\x80\x99s aristocrats Rivaldo, Lu\xc3\xads Figo and Hristo Stoichkov.</p> <p>He was also a member of Holland\xe2\x80\x99s Euro 96 squad \xe2\x80\x93 Bogarde played in the 4-1 defeat by England in the group phase \xe2\x80\x93 and would have been selected for the World Cup semi-final against Brazil at France 98 but broke a leg in training.</p> <p>Given his pedigree and experience it seems surprising Bogarde was not viewed as an asset by Chelsea. Yet despite pictures from the time that suggest he gained weight, and the sense he stagnated at the club, Bogarde insists fitness and attitude were not issues.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was working hard because if the club needs you, the team needs you, or if another teams need you \xe2\x80\x93 you need to be ready,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI had some injuries also. I hurt my knee \xe2\x80\x93 three or four months I was out. So these things come mentally in your head.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>And the perception he was happier to be paid than play? \xe2\x80\x9cI can imagine people from the outside seeing it like that,\xe2\x80\x9d says Bogarde. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople think: \xe2\x80\x98Oh he\xe2\x80\x99s just sitting there for his money\xe2\x80\x99. But it was not like that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Bogarde shows a first moment of regret. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I could do it over I would have done it very differently,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the people of Chelsea would also maybe take a different decision.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Asked what Bogarde would change there is no clear answer. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a combination for the both of us [him and the club] \xe2\x80\x93 we would do it very differently and come with the best solution.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Bogarde laughs when asked if he resided in England when at the club, saying he lived for two years in Windsor and for two years at Chelsea Harbour. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.</p> <p>The question is asked because of the stories he flew in for training from the Netherlands each morning. This is flatly denied. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course not. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand how people come to these ridiculous stories, or lies or whatever. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been in the training at Chelsea, I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been on time. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never skipped training or I was never sick. I never [have] problems in any way with the club or in private matters. My relationship with people of Chelsea \xe2\x80\x93 the real people \xe2\x80\x93 is from the coffee lady to the kit man.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Graeme Le Saux and Winston Bogarde mess about in a Chelsea training session in 2002. Photograph: Andy Couldridge/Action Images    <p>Bogarde did become lonely. \xe2\x80\x9cMentally it was very hard,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cTo keep the motivation it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult but since I was very young I had to cope with a lot of difficult situations and each I overcame.\xe2\x80\x9d Bogarde, who has five children, however, had the support of his family. \xe2\x80\x9cI had a relationship and I had my kids, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.</p> <p>The Dutchman, however, cannot recall his final appearance in professional football. \xe2\x80\x9cI really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you \xe2\x80\x93 maybe you can tell me \xe2\x80\x93 but it must be a long time ago.\xe2\x80\x9d Told this was 6 November 2002 and that he came on as a 69th-minute substitute in a League Cup tie against Gillingham, Bogarde says: \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>On finally leaving Chelsea had he completely fallen out of love with football? \xe2\x80\x9cNot completely. But because it was a tough time for me, yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99d had enough of the tough world of football,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. There was a final attempt to revive his career in summer 2004. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to end like that so I have the feeling: \xe2\x80\x98OK, if I can push still one year out of me it would be great.\xe2\x80\x99 But I got injured [training] at Ajax. And for my body it was, no, it\xe2\x80\x99s OK now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>That was 11 years ago. What has he been doing since? \xe2\x80\x9cHaving fun. But it didn\xe2\x80\x99t last that long, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in football all my life,\xe2\x80\x9d Bogarde says.</p> <p>There were ventures into the business world, though he denies some stories: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a gaming club.\xe2\x80\x9d But he did have \xe2\x80\x9can entertainment company, yeah. We did parties and concerts. It was fun.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>There was also a book about his life called: \xe2\x80\x9cThis Negro bows to Nobody\xe2\x80\x9d. Asked about the title, Bogarde says: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a black person, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t have problem with that word. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x93 for me \xe2\x80\x93 [think of] it as a bad word.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Now, despite holding a Uefa Pro Licence, he\xe2\x80\x99s struggling to find an opportunity. Bogarde unsuccessfully applied for the Motherwell manager\xe2\x80\x99s job and recently did the same at Oldham Athletic. Bogarde accepts clubs may be wary of giving him an opportunity because of what happened at Chelsea.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf people have that in the backs of their mind, that could be a negative for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that has been when I was a player. I\xe2\x80\x99m a trainer-coach now. Many people, players, ex-pros have been in problems and I see they are trainer-coaches now. So why should that be like a heavy sword on my back?</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s still dragging with me, maybe all my life. Everybody makes mistakes and I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned from it but you need to go on.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Winston Bogarde has struggled to find opportunities in football, despite holding a Uefa Pro Licence. Photograph: Irina Popova for the Guardian    <p>It is clear Bogarde wants to remake his life and reputation. He lights up when he talks about football. \xe2\x80\x9cAm I content? Yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m content but I want to be on the pitch. I have my badges already a few years and I\xe2\x80\x99m just waiting for a chance to do what I can.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Chelsea experience will allow him to speak directly to footballers about the game\xe2\x80\x99s pitfalls. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can teach them not to make kinds of decisions in a critical moment in their career,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m trying to use the experience of my whole career to pass it on to the young players.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>When asked the one thing he would say to any young footballer, Bogarde\xe2\x80\x99s answer is telling.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI can understand that when you\xe2\x80\x99re young and making a lot of money there are a lot of circumstance around you \xe2\x80\x93 people are pulling at you, girls are coming, you want to have good time,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you have to understand that all those things are thanks to football. So football needs to be in first place to keep that focus, to keep that discipline and it can take you very far.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Bogarde\xe2\x80\x99s hope now is that football will take him back in. He certainly deserves a second chance.</p>'
