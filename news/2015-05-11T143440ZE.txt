b"Goalkeepers <p>Karen Bardsley Manchester City</p> <p>Age 30 Caps 43</p>     Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Karen Bardsley Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images    <p>Born in Santa Monica, California, the 5ft 11in Bardsley seems all-American at first glance but qualifies for England due to family roots in Stockport. After majoring in graphic design at California State University she played professionally for assorted clubs in the United States and Sweden before joining Lincoln Ladies in 2013. A move to Manchester City followed a year later.</p> <p>Siobhan Chamberlain Arsenal Ladies</p> <p>Age 31 Caps 33</p> <p>The London-born sports science graduate from Loughborough University later earned a masters degree in nutrition and has worked part-time as a college lecturer. Canada will be familiar terrain to the 5ft 10in Chamberlain, who enjoyed a stint with Vancouver Whitecaps during a varied career which, before Arsenal, also took her to Chelsea, Fulham and Bristol Academy.</p>  <p> Related: Women's World Cup 2015: full tournament schedule </p>   <p>Carly Telford Notts County</p> <p>Age 27 Caps 5</p> <p>At only 5ft 7in Telford is small for a goalkeeper but extremely talented. Born in Jesmond, a suburb of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, she played for Sunderland, Leeds and Chelsea as well as Australia\xe2\x80\x99s Perth Glory before joining Notts County. But for such strong competition from Bardsley and Chamberlain she would have won more caps by now.</p> Defenders <p>Laura Bassett Notts County</p> <p>Age 31 Caps 49</p> <p>A centre-half who is also comfortable in central midfield, Bassett\xe2\x80\x99s game exudes reliability and quiet authority. An Aston Villa fan, she is enjoying life with Notts County after an eclectic career featuring spells with Coventry, Birmingham, Arsenal, Leeds and Chelsea.</p> <p>Lucy Bronze Manchester City</p> <p>Age 23 Caps 16</p> <p>A right-back capable of playing anywhere across the backline, Bronze will be playing in her first senior World Cup. Half-Portuguese/half-English she was born in Berwick-upon-Tweed and grew up in north Northumberland, living for a time on Lindisfarne \xe2\x80\x93 or Holy Island. Before joining City she played for Sunderland, Everton and Liverpool and also lived in the US for a time after winning a sports scholarship at the University of North Carolina.</p> <p>Alex Greenwood Notts County</p> <p>Age 21 Caps 12</p> <p>The Merseyside-born left-back or centre-half and former England youth captain recently left Everton, where she spent her formative years \xe2\x80\x93 despite being a fanatical Liverpool supporter. Jamie Carragher remains her hero.</p> <p>Steph Houghton Manchester City</p> <p>Age 27 Caps 53</p>     Captain Steph Houghton Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images    <p>The England and Manchester City captain is the first woman to have appeared on the front cover of Shoot magazine. Very much a \xe2\x80\x9ctotal\xe2\x80\x9d footballer Houghton, from Wearside, where she began her career with Sunderland, is listed as a defender but can also play across midfield as well as in attack. She generally plays left-back for Manchester City but Mark Sampson could utilise her versatility.</p> <p>Claire Rafferty Chelsea</p> <p>Age 26 Caps 9</p> <p>The left-back or left wing-back and Loughborough University economics graduate has suffered three anterior cruciate ligament ruptures and it is a testament to her courage and resilience that she remains a top defender. But for those knee injuries the Kent-born Rafferty \xe2\x80\x93 who began her career with Millwall Lionesses \xe2\x80\x93 would have won many more caps.</p> <p>Alex Scott Arsenal</p> <p>Age 30 Caps 123</p> <p>The right-back is an accomplished newspaper columnist who adores writing and may well embark on a full-time media career after retirement. The London-born defender is back at Arsenal after interludes with Birmingham and across the Atlantic at Boston Breakers. She co-founded the Alex Scott Academy for young female footballers in Kingston, Surrey.</p> <p>Casey Stoney Arsenal Ladies</p> <p>Age 32 Caps 118</p> <p>The versatile defender \xe2\x80\x93 Stoney can play anywhere across the backline \xe2\x80\x93 was England\xe2\x80\x99s long-serving captain before a serious foot injury saw Sampson replace her with Houghton. The first female member of the PFA\xe2\x80\x99s management committee she is back at Arsenal after stints with Charlton, Chelsea and Lincoln. Suffered homophobic abuse on social media after coming out as gay last year. Stoney also captained the Great Britain football team in the 2012 Olympics.</p> Midfielders <p>Katie Chapman Chelsea</p> <p>Age 32 Caps 85</p>     Kelly Smith celebrates with goalscorer Katie Chapman during the 2010 Women\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup qualifying match against Spain at the Den in London. Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images    <p>The tough-tackling midfielder and mother of three is back in the squad after a four-year absence due to maternity leave and a fall-out with Mark Sampson\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor, Hope Powell. Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s captain, Chapman is hoping to celebrate her 33rd birthday playing in Canada. She is remembered with affection in north America following an impressive stint with Chicago Red Stars. Chapman is at the forefront of initiatives to make it easier for women to combine motherhood with careers in football.</p> <p>Jade Moore Birmingham City</p> <p>Age 24 Caps 16</p> <p>Moore\xe2\x80\x99s career seemed under threat when a routine screening revealed she had two holes in her heart but she was soon back playing after corrective surgery. The former Lincoln and Leeds midfielder won an FA scholarship to Loughborough University as a teenager and is combining life at Birmingham with further studies at Leeds Metropolitan University.</p> <p>Jordan Nobbs Arsenal</p> <p>Age 22 Caps 21</p> <p>The daughter of former Hartlepool United defender Keith Nobbs, Jordan is a combative goalscoring central midfielder. She was born and brought up in Stockton-on-Tees and played for Sunderland before being poached by Arsenal.</p> <p>Jo Potter Birmingham City</p> <p>Age 30 Caps 19</p> <p>The former left-wing turned creative central midfielder \xe2\x80\x93 although Potter can still fill a left-sided role \xe2\x80\x93 was recalled to the England squad by Sampson last year following a seven-year absence. An excellent crosser of the ball, she also scores regularly. From Mansfield, she has spent her career with Birmingham and also works as an FA skills coach.</p> <p>Jill Scott Manchester City</p> <p>Age 28 Caps 90</p> <p>The 5ft 11in box-to-box midfielder is one of Sampson\xe2\x80\x99s most technically accomplished individuals. Able to read the game superbly and adept at altering attacking angles, Scott shone at the last Cup in Germany. Born and brought up on Wearside she was a top distance runner with Sunderland Harriers before opting to concentrate on football.</p> <p>Fara Williams Liverpool</p> <p>Age 31 Caps 133</p> <p>England\xe2\x80\x99s most-capped player, Williams is a goalscoring midfielder and set-piece specialist. One of the best players England has produced, she combines her Liverpool career with working as an FA skills coach. Formerly with Chelsea, Charlton and Everton, Williams had a difficult upbringing and was homeless for six years early in her career. Unbeknown to her former team-mates, she combined living rough with staying in hostels and now devotes considerable amounts of her spare time to volunteering for charities helping the homeless.</p> Forwards <p>Eniola Aluko Chelsea</p> <p>Age 28 Caps 90</p> <p>The sister of the Hull City striker Sone Aluko, Eniola has a first-class honours degree in law and aims to establish her own legal practice. Born in Lagos, she is the daughter of a former Nigerian politican and, last year, became the first female pundit to appear on Match of the Day. Having enjoyed a stint with Atlanta, she is well known to north American audiences. Nigeria would have loved her playing for them in Canada but Aluko\xe2\x80\x99s decision to opt for England is very much Sampson\xe2\x80\x99s gain.</p> <p>Karen Carney Birmingham City</p> <p>Age 27 Caps 103</p>     Birmingham City\xe2\x80\x99s Karen Carney Photograph: John Clifton/Action Images    <p>A member of the 100-cap club Carney is back at Birmingham, her first club, following spells at Arsenal and with Chicago Red Stars. The gifted forward recently spoke publicly about overcoming a longstanding battle with depression.</p> <p>Toni Duggan Manchester City</p> <p>Age 23 Caps 25</p> <p>A pacy forward or winger with an impressive goals/games ratio, the Liverpool-born former Everton forward courted controversy by posing for photographs with Louis van Gaal hours after his Manchester United side had beaten Manchester City. Duggan later apologised for \xe2\x80\x9can error of judgment\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Fran Kirby Reading</p> <p>Age 21 Caps 8</p> <p>Kirby has been in wonderful form for Reading, her home team. Scoring freely after returning to the game last season following a four-year absence suffering from severe clinical depression, sparked by her mother\xe2\x80\x99s death, the striker has caught Sampson\xe2\x80\x99s eye in recent months.</p> <p>Lianne Sanderson Arsenal</p> <p>Age 27 Caps 46</p> <p>The widely-travelled striker is back with her first club Arsenal following a mini world tour incorporating stints playing in the US, Spain and Cyprus. The Londoner is back in the England fold after she fell out with Powell.</p> <p>Jodie Taylor Portland Thorns</p> <p>Age 28 Caps 8</p> <p>Domiciled in the US, where she leads the Portland Thorns attack, Taylor has played across the US as well as in Canada, for Ottawa, and Australia, with Melbourne Victory, since leaving her native Merseyside.</p> <p>Ellen White Notts County</p> <p>Age 26 Caps 50</p> <p>A tall, strong striker, White has hit form for Notts County after spending the whole of last season sidelined by a ruptured cruciate ligament. From Buckinghamshire, she has played for Chelsea, Leeds and Arsenal. Nicknamed \xe2\x80\x9cEllsbells\xe2\x80\x9d.</p>"
