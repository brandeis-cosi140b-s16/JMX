b'David de Gea is saving grace of Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s confusing season | Paul Wilson'


b"<p>Two candidates for player of the season provide the subplot when Tottenham Hotspur visit Manchester United on Sunday afternoon. The visitors bring Harry Kane, without whose goals Spurs would be nowhere near the top four, while the home side boast David de Gea, without whose saves United might be nowhere near the top four either.</p> <p>The main plot revolves around which of the two sides is going to clinch Champions League qualification, assuming both are not eclipsed by Liverpool, and that De Gea has been United\xe2\x80\x99s outstanding performer this season is what is enabling Mauricio Pochettino and his players to travel with optimism. As Roy Keane said after the goalkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s splendid resistance in a lost cause against Arsenal in the FA Cup: \xe2\x80\x9cDe Gea is probably the best goalkeeper in the world at the moment but it is not good for United that he is getting man of the match most weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Burnley 1-0 Manchester City | Premier League match report </p>   <p>It is probably not good news for United either that Iker Casillas played so poorly for Real Madrid in midweek, or that De Gea\xe2\x80\x99s Spanish girlfriend has just described Manchester, memorably but not completely unfairly, as \xe2\x80\x9cuglier than the back of a fridge\xe2\x80\x9d. De Gea\xe2\x80\x99s contract with United runs until summer next year and even if he renews the interest from Spain is unlikely to go away. For Jamie Carragher it is as good as settled. \xe2\x80\x9cMadrid need a new keeper, De Gea wants to win trophies,\xe2\x80\x9d the former Liverpool defender tweeted this week. \xe2\x80\x9cNo brainer.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It possibly is quite that simple, though Peter Schmeichel believes United need to make a statement by ensuring De Gea stays. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is one of the club\xe2\x80\x99s best players and it is important he signs a new contract to send out a positive signal,\xe2\x80\x9d the Dane said.</p> <p>De Gea is out on his own as United\xe2\x80\x99s best player this season, a new twist on the state of affairs post-Schmeichel when the team\xe2\x80\x99s outfield efforts were constantly being undermined by uncertainty between the posts. Now the uncertainty is everywhere else. One of the reasons De Gea has been so prominent, apart from his obvious ability, might be that he is the only player who knows exactly where he stands every week. Louis van Gaal cannot interfere with the goalkeeping position, whereas just about every other position on the field has been subject to change. Wayne Rooney has been playing in midfield. Antonio Valencia has not only been operating as a wing-back, which is reasonable, but as a full-back, which seems unnecessary. \xc3\x81ngel Di Mar\xc3\xada has been used as a striker, which is not his strength, and though now back in midfield he is being deployed on the right rather than his more customary left. Marouane Fellaini keeps being pressed into action as an emergency centre-forward but only Ashley Young, out on the left, looks a better player under Van Gaal than he did previously.</p> <p>Normally, when a goalkeeper keeps winning man of the match awards the story is a simple one. The defence is not good enough, the team will be in trouble. Yet United are not exactly in trouble. They remain on course for a Champions League place, and partly, though not solely, due to De Gea\xe2\x80\x99s excellence, only two teams in the league \xe2\x80\x93 Chelsea and Southampton \xe2\x80\x93 have conceded fewer goals. Spurs, by comparison, have conceded more goals than anyone else in the top half of the table and scored one fewer than United, so the general perception that White Hart Lane is enjoying one of its better seasons while Old Trafford remains in the doldrums may be a little wide of the mark, even if Spurs are looking for a third successive win at a ground where success eluded them for almost the whole of Sir Alex Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s reign.</p> <p>It is all about expectations. Spurs these days are expected to be up for the cups and make a convincing bid, not necessarily a successful one, for a top-four place and that is pretty much what they are doing. United, with a new manager and \xc2\xa3150m spent on players, are expected to put the horrors of last season firmly behind them and that is what they are not doing. They are achieving results with some consistency \xe2\x80\x93 two defeats since the turn of the year \xe2\x80\x93 but horrifying their supporters by moving the ball cautiously, playing slowly as if attempting to bore their opponents into submission, and making unforced errors in defence.</p> <p>It seems clear what Van Gaal is trying to do: his basic philosophy is to keep the ball and let the opponents tire themselves out by running around after it, though there are a couple of potential flaws to the plan. One is that not every team comes to Old Trafford with a willingness to chase everything down or take the game to United, damage limitation is still an ingrained habit and it is not unusual for visiting sides to sit back and wait to see how long they can keep the game scoreless.</p> <p>The resulting ennui is what gives rise to chants of \xe2\x80\x9cattack, attack, attack\xe2\x80\x9d, which, in turn, make the home players less confident at carrying out their manager\xe2\x80\x99s instructions. The other is that playing a patient, percentage game relies on a solid defence. If you aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to overwhelm opponents and try to win by as many goals as possible, narrow margins of victory are difficult to protect if you make the sort of mistake Valencia did against Arsenal. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had the feeling we lost because of ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d Van Gaal said. \xe2\x80\x9cNot because of the opponent.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Leicester City's Nigel Pearson swears at journalist after Hull draw </p>   <p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho used to be the king of the 1-0 victory \xe2\x80\x93 there were nine such scorelines in his first title-winning season at Chelsea \xe2\x80\x93 and before that George Graham at Arsenal. Both were based on the assumption the defence knew how to keep a clean sheet. Van Gaal would like to be able to say the same, but though the United defence has stabilised to a certain extent since the improbable scorelines of early season, it is not yet settled enough to be reliable and the manager has been switching between systems since he arrived.</p> <p>No one would dare suggest Van Gaal does not know what he is doing, his CV demands respect, though he has been sending out mixed messages, whether insisting he wants quicker passing then promoting a slower tempo, or complaining that 4-4-2 leaves United too open then ditching his initial preference for three at the back.</p> <p>With all this confusion in front of him, De Gea has remained the one constant. Van Gaal brought in cover in the form of V\xc3\xadctor Vald\xc3\xa9s, but cover is all the former Barcelona goalkeeper has remained. \xe2\x80\x9cUnbelievable,\xe2\x80\x9d is the word Van Gaal uses to describe some of De Gea\xe2\x80\x99s saves. If United manage to see out the coming month of demanding fixtures to keep their top-four position De Gea will be due a lot of the credit, though he might have to share it with his manager.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn spite of a bad start I think we have done rather well,\xe2\x80\x9d Van Gaal says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are a stable club in the top four. With the difficulty of the fixtures ahead now is the time to show it, but we are already longer in the top four than Arsenal. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, but it is true.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>"
