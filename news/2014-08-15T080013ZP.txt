b'Premier League 2014-15 preview No19: West Brom | Paul Doyle'


b'<p>Guardian writers\xe2\x80\x99 predicted position: 19th (NB: this is not necessarily Paul Doyle\xe2\x80\x99s prediction but the average of our writers\xe2\x80\x99 tips)</p> <p>Last season\xe2\x80\x99s position: 17th</p> <p>Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 5,000-1</p> <p>Hillary Clinton chided Barack Obama this week by carping that \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t do stupid stuff\xe2\x80\x9d is not a substantial enough tip to amount to a policy. But it is surely a decent starting point and one that West Bromwich Albion would do well to bear in mind this season. For three years the Baggies abandoned their boing-boing ways and embraced stability but last term they started to unravel. It remains to be seen whether they have now pulled themselves together or further apart.</p> <p>It is probably safe to rule out another quenelle-based disgrace at the Hawthorns in the near future but it is not yet clear whether the football-related decisions that the club has made this summer are any better than the ones that led to them dicing with relegation last season. There has been change aplenty in recent months and if it does not trigger rapid improvement, then the Baggies will be doomed.</p> <p>First off, having gone through two managers last season, Albion have a new one for this term \xe2\x80\x93 or rather a new head coach \xe2\x80\x93 since the club\xe2\x80\x99s director of football-style structure does not give the first-team leader the range of powers traditionally associated with managers. Both Steve Clarke and Pepe Mel became frustrated by the constraints in which they had to work last season and Tim Sherwood, who seemed close to succeeding the Spaniard earlier this summer, was apparently put off by the arrangement too. So Alan Irvine got the gig and says he has taken it with his eyes wide open, whereas many West Brom fans have reacted to his appointment with their mouths wide open, bawling sometimes unprintable sentiments about the logic behind hiring someone who has never managed in the Premier League. One popular suspicion is that Irvine was appointed because no more experienced manager would relish working in the environment fostered by chairman Jeremy Peace, but Irvine\xe2\x80\x99s strong coaching credentials, gained thanks to his years at Everton, were surely a big factor.</p>     Alan Irvine has a strong coaching record, but has never before managed a team in the Premier League.

Eight new ones have arrived this summer and more are required because many departed at the end of last season and left holes in every sector of the side except in goal, where Ben Foster has extended his contract.</p> <p>Billy Jones decision to move on to Sunderland deprived the Baggies of a fine full-back; Liam Ridgewell\xe2\x80\x99s departure did not. Diego Lugano will not be particularly missed either, but all those defenders, as well as Steven Reid and Goran Popov, needed replacing. West Brom have made a good progress on that front: Joleon Lescott should help solidify the centre of defence, while the left-backs Jason Davidson and S\xc3\xa9bastien Pocognoli should prove significant upgrades on last season. The Costa Rica international Cristian Gamboa boasts good pedigree and Andre Wisdom looks a useful loan signing from Liverpool.</p> <p>West Brom\xe2\x80\x99s biggest single investment, of course, was in Ideye Brown and it could turn out to be a shrewd one. The club suffered from chronic scoring trouble last year largely because they failed to find a suitable replacement for Romelu Lukaku \xe2\x80\x93 Victor Anichebe has qualities but not yet enough of them \xe2\x80\x93 but Brown has the potential to fit right in. Very powerful and fast, the Nigeria international signed from Dynamo Kiev for \xc2\xa310m is a more accomplished finisher than Anichebe and more clever in his movements. After scoring prolifically in Ukraine and France he could thrive at the Hawthorns. Saido Berahino should continue to ripen to give West Brom the option of diversifying their attack to good effect.</p>     Ideye Brown moved to West Brom for \xc2\xa310m over the summer, but the striker failed to make Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup squad. Photograph: Antonio Calanni/AP    <p>But who will supply that attack? West Brom already lacked invention last season and with Morgan Amalfitano having gone back to whence he came, and James Morrison recovering from knee surgery, their most creative midfielders are St\xc3\xa9phane Sessegnon, who last season interspersed some brilliant displays with periods of dull ineffectiveness, and Graham Dorrans, whose return to form in the second half of last term was one of the few visible improvements under Mel. Craig Gardner is a reasonable addition from Sunderland but hardly a transformative one. Out wide, the Baggies are threadbare even if Chris Brunt has decided to stay. Brunt has a left foot so cultured that it spent the summer writing sonnets while its owner penned a new deal, but the Northern Irishman\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness is hindered by his lack of speed, especially when deployed as a wing-back or full-back. West Brom badly need more pace out wide but, at this stage, Irvine might accept even another slow player if it at least meant not starting the campaign with a drastic winger shortage.</p> <p>At the moment, West Brom\xe2\x80\x99s squad looks inchoate, possibly inadequate and definitely in the hands of an inexperienced man who has been set a formidable challenge. A good start to the campaign would prevent an early increase in anxiety at the Hawthorns and the fixture schedule has been kind enough to line up Sunderland, Southampton and Swansea in the first three matches, all teams also grappling with uncertainty. But the casualty list has been less generous, with injuries to Lescott and Gareth McAulay leaving the defence looking vulnerable for some or all of those matches. But West Brom need to gather points as quickly as they can because their run-in, like that of Norwich last season, looks as ominous as a court summons: West Brom\xe2\x80\x99s last five matches are at home to Liverpool and Arsenal and away to Manchester United, Newcastle and Chelsea.</p>'
