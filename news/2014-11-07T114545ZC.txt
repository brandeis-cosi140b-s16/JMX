b'<p>Chelsea striker Diego Costa has been left out of Vicente del Bosque\xe2\x80\x99s Spain squad for this month\xe2\x80\x99s matches with Belarus and Germany to help him recover from his recent injuries.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI have spoken to our doctors and those of Chelsea and I have decided to leave him out due to the situation with his pubis (pelvis),\xe2\x80\x9d Del Bosque told a news conference on Friday.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe may be able to play (in) Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s next game against Liverpool (on Saturday) but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have some type of injury problem.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Del Bosque added: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have reached a decision with Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s medical staff that we will take a break due to his groin issues. It has nothing to do with whether he later plays for his club. He always wants to come with us, but we have spoken and this is the best for his health.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>However, Chelsea manager Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho denied he had oany influence over the decision.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI want to make it very, very clear that I did nothing for that to happen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very good news for him, for us and also for the national team.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNow he has to go in the right direction. It\xe2\x80\x99s good for Spain to have a good Diego and not a so-so Diego.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>European champions Spain have made a stuttering start to their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign and are second in Group C with six points from three games behind Slovakia on nine.</p> <p>They host Belarus in their next qualifier on 15 November before welcoming Germany for a friendly three days later.</p> <p>Costa was called up for the matches against Slovakia and Luxembourg last month which led to a row with Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho who felt the Brazilian-born striker needed rest after suffering groin and hamstring injuries.</p> <p>Costa missed the following four matches for Chelsea and, while he is now back playing for the Premier League side, Del Bosque has decided to give him a break.</p> <p>Celta Vigo winger Nolito, the Juventus striker \xc3\x81lvaro Morata and Malaga defender Ignacio Camacho have also been included in Del Bosque\xe2\x80\x99s latest squad.</p> <p>Costa scored his first international goal for his adopted country in last month\xe2\x80\x99s 4-0 win over Luxembourg.</p>'
