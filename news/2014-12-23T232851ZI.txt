b'I could have faced Barcelona playing for Manchester City, says Xavi'


b'<p>The Barcelona captain, Xavi, has expressed his relief that he stayed with the Spanish club as he believes he could otherwise have ended up playing against them for Manchester City in the Champions League round of 16.</p> <p>Last summer Xavi, 34, was linked with a move to New York City, the club Frank Lampard joined from Chelsea before being sent on loan to Manchester City, who are co-owners of the Major League Soccer club.</p> <p>In an interview with the Spanish paper Sport, Xavi said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, I was nearly screwed because maybe I\xe2\x80\x99d have faced the club [playing for Manchester City]. The truth is that now I realise it would have been shit for me to go. I\xe2\x80\x99d have been happy where I went but I\xe2\x80\x99ve done well to stay.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Xavi has been impressed by Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez since his \xc2\xa375m move from Liverpool in July, although the Uruguay striker scored his first La Liga goal only on Saturday in the 5-0 win over struggling Cordoba at Camp Nou.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe has goals in his blood,\xe2\x80\x9d Xavi said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have said that more will come. He will start scoring goals. He reminds me a bit, with his killer instinct to damage other teams, of Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o, that bad mood, that personality, that persistence.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
