b'Premier League preview: NBC pundits predict Manchester United resurgence'


b'<p>On Wednesday, three days before the start of a Premier League season eagerly awaited in the US as well as the UK, the Seattle Sounders right-back DeAndre Yedlin signed for Tottenham. On Wednesday evening, NBC\xe2\x80\x99s soccer pundits, preparing for a second season covering England\xe2\x80\x99s top flight after a very successful first, dealt what might be seen \xe2\x80\x93 admittedly, with a large dose of salt \xe2\x80\x93 to be a sobering blow to his hopes of immediate glory. </p> <p>At the Captain\xe2\x80\x99s Knock in midtown Manhattan, Robbie Earl, Robbie Mustoe and presenter Rebecca Lowe \xe2\x80\x93 and a special guest, the former Manchester United striker Dion Dublin \xe2\x80\x93 gave their predictions for the season to come. None of them picked Spurs to crack the top four.</p> Title winners &amp; top four <p>Robbie Mustoe: I have to consider Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s revival. We\xe2\x80\x99ve watched them in pre-season and it was super-impressive \xe2\x80\x93 super-intense. Louis van Gaal has changed the system a little bit. I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll be back in the top four. Then you think, who\xe2\x80\x99s going to drop out from last season, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a difficult season for Liverpool. We all know about losing Lu\xc3\xads Suarez to Barcelona and trying to replace those goals; they have a lot of new young players who will be good, but maybe not this season. So, let me get to it: fourth, Manchester United; third, Manchester City; second, Arsenal; first, Chelsea.</p> <p>Robbie Earle: It\xe2\x80\x99s a very important season for Chelsea. Last season, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the players he wanted. No excuses this year, the Special One. He called Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger a \xe2\x80\x9cspecialist in failure\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 I think it\xe2\x80\x99s two years now he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t won a trophy himself. With the players he\xe2\x80\x99s got, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go for Chelsea to win the league, followed by City. I think it might be difficult for them to go back to back and win it again, and I also think Champions League is now on the horizon. In third place, Liverpool. I have a lot of belief in Brendan Rogers, he\xe2\x80\x99s got some good young players, he\xe2\x80\x99s an inventive, evolving coach. And my fourth spot goes to United. Van Gaal is a game-changer. There was a time last season when in that tunnel, teams didn\xe2\x80\x99t fear United. I think Van Gaal will change that. </p> <p>In saying that, I\xe2\x80\x99m going against all my principles and my love of Wenger \xe2\x80\x93 I think Arsenal are out of the top four. They lost the title through not replacing Johan Djourou and not having a centre-midfield player to drive and win a game. This summer they haven\xe2\x80\x99t done any of that business they needed to do, as well as they played in the Community Shield.</p> <p>Rebecca Lowe: I don\xe2\x80\x99t ever get to give my opinion, so this is exciting. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go Arsenal fourth, because they need another striker; third, City, because I think they might focus on the Champions League. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go Chelsea second, and I think it may be the tightest title race ever. In first place\xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go United. After the era I grew up in, it\xe2\x80\x99s weird not to have them as favourites. And you can go from seventh to first \xe2\x80\x93 Liverpool almost did it last year. I think Van Gaal is a game-changer and I think Wayne Rooney will relish the captaincy, and I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll buy at least one big name before the end of the transfer window. You heard it here first.</p> <p>Dion Dublin: Van Gaal will bring back that fear, of having to perform in a Manchester United shirt. I think some people have come in recently and thought their shirt was safe. And it should never be. I think [former manager] David Moyes took the heart out of United \xe2\x80\x93 he tried his very best but when you take the engine out of a car you can\xe2\x80\x99t run it. I think that drive will come back. So I think it\xe2\x80\x99s United top, City second, Chelsea third and Arsenal fourth.</p> Best new signing <p>RM: Ander Herrera \xe2\x80\x93 a central-midfield player, talented, a playmaker, intelligent \xe2\x80\x93 is a player we should all watch at United and enjoy this season. It\xe2\x80\x99s something United have missed, having lost Paul Scholes. Someone who can play passes and see things and open things up. Herrera can do that. You\xe2\x80\x99re going to enjoy his creativity and his craft.</p> <p>RE: My signing of the season is Diego Costa at Chelsea, and that\xe2\x80\x99s because if you go back to when Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s sides won titles at Chelsea, they did play football and entertain, yes, but when they didn\xe2\x80\x99t or couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that they beat you with power and strength and intensity. They haven\xe2\x80\x99t done that with the likes of [Fernando] Torres or [Demba] Ba, who weren\xe2\x80\x99t good enough strikers to play that role. They now have a guy with 27 goals in la Liga, a big physical presence who will enjoy the Premier League.</p>     Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Calum Chambers. Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA    <p>RL: I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go for Calum Chambers, who Wenger has just brought to Arsenal from Southampton for a lot of money \xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa316m for a 19-year-old. He\xe2\x80\x99s versatile, he plays centre-back and full-back, he\xe2\x80\x99s a leader, he\xe2\x80\x99s what Arsenal have needed. Yes he\xe2\x80\x99s young, but I have a feeling we might be seeing the new Tony Adams. It\xe2\x80\x99s a big shout. Again, you heard it here first. I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll force his way in \xe2\x80\x93 Laurent Koscielny gets injured a lot, Per Mertesacker needs a rest after the World Cup. He could be the star of the season.</p> Going down <p>RM: You always think of the three [Burnley, Leicester City and Queens Park Rangers] that have come up. I think of those, Burnley are using their money from coming up to secure the club, which you can\xe2\x80\x99t complain about, but not much is going into the playing side. Last season, West Bromwich Albion somehow managed to stay up. Alan Irvine is an uninspiring choice as manager. Have they brought in much talent? Not really. My last team to go miraculously survived last year \xe2\x80\x93 Sunderland. They\xe2\x80\x99ve lost good players, there\xe2\x80\x99s talk of Connor Wickham going too. I think they\xe2\x80\x99re down.</p>     Burnley celebrate winning promotion to the Premier League. Photograph: Paul Burrows/Action Images    <p>RE: If you look at West Brom and last year, and what they\xe2\x80\x99ve done this summer, I can\xe2\x80\x99t see how they\xe2\x80\x99ve changed enough to stay up again. Burnley have a manager called Sean Dyche \xe2\x80\x93 they call him \xe2\x80\x9cthe Ginger Mourinho\xe2\x80\x9d, well, he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to be extra special. And my third team is going to be Southampton. I feel that if you rip the heart out of a club \xe2\x80\x93 if you lose the coach and sell the best players \xe2\x80\x93 before a ball is kicked everyone at that club has an excuse for going down. They a new coach in Ronald Koeman who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know the league; if they start badly, they\xe2\x80\x99re on a rocky road.</p> <p>RL: I agree with Burnley, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go with Leicester City \xe2\x80\x93 two out of the three might go down. My third team is a little left-field: Aston Villa. I think trouble lies ahead. I think Roy Keane will be manager by November and it\xe2\x80\x99s all over. Finally.</p> <p>DD: Burnley unfortunately \xe2\x80\x93 Sean Dyche is a friend of mine, I played with him at Millwall, so I know how he thinks and what he wants from his players and how good he is. But I think it will be a bit too much. They need more quality. West Brom have survived so many times \xe2\x80\x93 not this time. Leicester won\xe2\x80\x99t go down \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s rubbish, Rebecca. I think Sunderland will struggle too.</p> Dark horses     Mauricio Pochettino impressed at Southampton; now he\xe2\x80\x99s at White Hart Lane. Photograph: Tottenham Hotspur via Action Images    <p>RM: In terms of expectation levels, I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at Spurs. Expectation was very high last season and they disappointed \xe2\x80\x93 they changed manager a couple of times, they had a bit of a disaster. But this year, Mauricio Pochettino is a bright young manager, he\xe2\x80\x99s hungry, and they have a good squad of players. They could surprise \xe2\x80\x93 not top four but best of the rest.</p> <p>RE: Stoke City.</p> <p>RL: Where were you born, Robbie?</p> <p>RE: Stoke. But Mark Hughes has come in and moved it on \xe2\x80\x93 Tony Pulis had them playing a certain way but the signing of Bojan Krkic [from Barcelona] was a huge signal that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do it a different way. They might just surprise a few people, I think.</p> <p>RL: Newcastle United. They\xe2\x80\x99ve brought in decent-looking players and Alan Pardew is a Crystal Palace legend and a very good manager with a good squad and I think they\xe2\x80\x99ll come in sixth or seventh.</p> <p>Robbie Mustoe, Robbie Earle and Rebecca Lowe were speaking courtesy of Captain\xe2\x80\x99s Knock, a business networking organisation with a charitable focus, based in New York and London.</p>'
