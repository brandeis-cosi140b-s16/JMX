b'Joe Hart has a fight on his hands to keep his position as City No1'


b'<p>Joe Hart\xe2\x80\x99s career has become an unwanted personal Groundhog Day. In this cycle are two different No1s who alternate between being surprisingly poor and breathtakingly impressive when playing for Manchester City and England.</p> <p>The bad Hart features him as the weak point of the team when schoolboy errors give up goals and games are lost, yet the good one is a commanding presence who pulls off dazzling saves that raise team spirit and claim invaluable points.</p> <p>The pattern has again been evident in his last two outings. The goalkeeper on show on Monday evening in Basel put on an exhibition of shot-stopping and leadership from the back in England\xe2\x80\x99s 2-0 defeat of Switzerland in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier.</p> <p>The previous match against Stoke City had the Hart who seeks to scupper a stellar career and which moved Manuel Pellegrini to drop him last season.</p> <p>In allowing Mame Diouf\xe2\x80\x99s regulation 58th-minute attempt to slip through his legs and Stoke to leave the Etihad Stadium with a shock 1-0 win, Hart showed just why the manager was willing to pay \xc2\xa36m for Willy Caballero, Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s No1 at his previous club, Malaga.</p> <p>Asked about the mistake, Pellegrini hardly offers confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not waiting for Joe Hart to make a mistake to change him for Willy Caballero,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cWilly Caballero and Joe Hart know that I\xe2\x80\x99m not waiting for Joe to make a first mistake. Maybe in the last year Joe didn\xe2\x80\x99t start very well but he finished [last season] very well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini told Caballero when he signed that he would be offered a fair chance to become first-choice should Hart, 27, again slip up. As the Chilean says: \xe2\x80\x9cIn this moment I\xe2\x80\x99m playing Joe Hart but he [Caballero] will have his opportunity soon.\xe2\x80\x9d Pressed again if Stoke goal\xe2\x80\x99s was Hart\xe2\x80\x99s fault, Pellegrini says: \xe2\x80\x9cI analyse the goals and individual mistakes with the players, I analyse the goals with the whole team and I think a lot of players were involved in [conceding] that goal.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>City travel to Arsenal for \xe2\x80\x99s early game, before Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League trip to Bayern Munich, and then host Chelsea a week on Sunday. . Pellegrini has no doubt Caballero could play in his strongest XI.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course Willy Caballero can be in any team, he\xe2\x80\x99s a very good goalkeeper,\xe2\x80\x9d the manager says. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to be a top goalkeeper you must have all the attributes, good distribution, to know when to go for the ball, to be good one-on-one, to not concede early goals. Willy has a good career behind him. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to have competition in every position in the team, not just with Joe Hart and Caballero.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cReplacing Joe Hart with Cabellero doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make a difference, just as with Zabaleta or Sagna or Mangala or Demichelis or Dzeko or Ag\xc3\xbcero, it\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the same, we need a squad if we want to win something.\xe2\x80\x9d Hart\xe2\x80\x99s position seems to have been under constant review for the past two seasons or so. The 2012-13 failed championship defence featured him being questioned by Roberto Mancini, the manager at the time, after Real Madrid scored two late goals to beat City 3-2 at the Bernab\xc3\xa9u in the Champions League.</p> <p>Their strained relationship was hardly eased by mistakes which allowed Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s winner in a 1-0 defeat on Boxing Day 2012 and the following February\xe2\x80\x99s 3-1 loss at Southampton, when Hart was culpable for the second goal.</p> <p>Despite Monday\xe2\x80\x99s fine show there have also been wobbles on England duty. Before a World Cup qualifier against Poland in October 2012 Roy Keane branded him \xe2\x80\x9ccocky\xe2\x80\x9d and Hart apologised after the game for conceding Kamil Glik\xe2\x80\x99s equaliser as Roy Hodgson\xe2\x80\x99s side dropped two points. The following month Hart was again shaky, at fault for at least two of the goals when Sweden scored four in a friendly.</p> <p>Last season, Pellegrini discarded Hart following a series of errors including one that allowed Fernando Torres a late Chelsea winner at Stamford Bridge in October. Costel Pantilimon was drafted in for seven league matches before Hart\xe2\x80\x99s reinstatement.</p> <p>The recent slew of new contracts awarded to City\xe2\x80\x99s A-list performers did not include Hart. That may yet happen but the sense is that he may soon face a serious fight with Caballero to retain his status.</p>'
