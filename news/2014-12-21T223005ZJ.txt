b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho: Chelsea fringe players are frustrated but also professional'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s insistence that the good of the collective be placed ahead of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s desire to feature dictates that the Chelsea manager will volunteer no explanation, even to senior players displaced in his selection.</p> <p>The Portuguese takes his side to Stoke City on Mondayseeking to re-establish a three-point advantage at the top of the Premier League, with Thibaut Courtois expected to start in goal, C\xc3\xa9sar Azpilicueta at left-back and Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas in central midfield despite the recent impressive form of Petr Cech, Filipe Lu\xc3\xads and Mikel John Obi. Mourinho merely intends to list his lineup for the Britannia Stadium in a team meeting on Monday and while he understands fringe players will be \xe2\x80\x9cunhappy and frustrated\xe2\x80\x9d at bit-part roles, he will demand a professional reaction to life on the periphery.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a difficult situation for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho when asked how the likes of Lu\xc3\xads or, indeed, the World Cup winner Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle react to being omitted from his starting team. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very club, team, team, club, group. I think everybody has to be ready to sacrifice for the team, to give everything for the team, to think about the team, not to be selfish. This is the way I want a team to be.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLook at Mikel. The first time he played was Newcastle and he was our best player. How can he be our best player if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t play in three months? Because he was working every day at the top level. Sad, frustrated, not happy? Maybe. But professional. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I expect from the players.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf they are not involved I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a secret to keeping them happy. They are unhappy and frustrated, and need to be patient, but the reality is that, to be successful and work at a high level, you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be happy. All of them are professionals. The team is more important than individuals. Mark Schwarzer hasn\xe2\x80\x99t played a second, but if he has to play tomorrow he would because he\xe2\x80\x99s ready. He\xe2\x80\x99s trained very well. We may have a secret to make them work every day at a high level, but no secret to keep them happy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho will confirm his team for the Stoke fixture in a pre-match meeting, but there will be no explanation offered to those being omitted unless they specifically seek one out. \xe2\x80\x9cI just put the team up,\xe2\x80\x9d said the manager. \xe2\x80\x9cNo explanation, because it\xe2\x80\x99s my decision. The players may not be happy, or not agree with the decision, but they know my decision is not to favour somebody or to punish somebody. It\xe2\x80\x99s what I think is best for the team at a certain moment. This is the way I do it.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s one of the first things I say to a squad at the beginning of the season: I told them I don\xe2\x80\x99t give explanations. I said they could knock on my office door. If they come to me and ask me to explain, no problem. But, in principle, I won\xe2\x80\x99t do it on my initiative. I have to make life easy for me. If I explain to one, I have to give them all explanations [why they are not playing]. In Christmas I\xe2\x80\x99d spend all my time explaining things.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf they ask, I\xe2\x80\x99ll explain. I had one who asked, knocking on my door asking why someone else was playing instead of him. I told him the other man was playing better, closed the door, goodbye. It\xe2\x80\x99s the concept of helping the team. Anyone who joins us must know the squad is strong at Chelsea. If you are a goalkeeper here, you can\xe2\x80\x99t come in thinking you are the only good goalkeeper. The same for the strikers.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho claimed no members of the current Chelsea squad have made their frustrations known to the management at a lack of first-team opportunities. Indeed, he even suggested Iker Casillas had not made his frustrations known face to face after his high-profile fall-out with the manager at his previous club, Real Madrid, where the manager adopted a similar policy.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut even when I sign a player I have to believe he will join in with the way we work, the way we live,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has to adapt to this certain kind of mentality.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Stoke City v Chelsea, SS1, 8pm</p>'
