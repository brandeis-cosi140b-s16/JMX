b'Arsenal v Galatasaray: Champions League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened | Jacob Steinberg'


b'<p>An impressive night\xe2\x80\x99s work from Arsenal, then, Wojciech Szczesny\xe2\x80\x99s red card the only blot in the copybook. They\xe2\x80\x99re on the board in their group thanks to a hat-trick from Danny Welbeck, who finished his chances with aplomb. The opposition weren\xe2\x80\x99t up to much, though, and it was concerning to see Alexis Sanchez, who also scored, sitting with an ice pack on his ankle ahead of the trip to Chelsea on Sunday. Still, a good win and a fine way for Arsene Wenger to celebrate his 18th Arsenal birthday. Thanks for reading and emailing. Good night.</p>'
