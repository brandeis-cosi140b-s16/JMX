b'Everton v Sunderland: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s a smash-and-grab win for Sunderland! They rode their luck at times, and got the benefit of a couple of crucial decisions. But they earned every lucky break: Dick Advocaat\xe2\x80\x99s men fought like cornered dogs, defended staunchly, pounced into attack when they could, and ultimately earned a priceless three points. A deserved win, which takes them up to 14th place in the Premier League table! Another victory next week at home to Leicester City should - should - be enough to keep them up. And they celebrate accordingly. A lot of gleeful prancing going on across the Goodison turf. Everton are booed off, which is a little unfair; they attacked relentlessly, but Sunderland appear to have been destined to win this one. They\xe2\x80\x99re now ahead of Hull City, Leicester City, Aston Villa - and Newcastle United. Worth turning up 30 minutes late for, huh?</p>'
