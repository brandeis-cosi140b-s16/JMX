b'Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend | Michael Butler and Nick Miller'


b'1) QPR see what they could have won <p>West Brom and QPR lost their managers around a month apart, with the surreal Alan Irvine experiment being cut short just after Christmas, and Harry Redknapp\xe2\x80\x99s seemingly inevitable resignation following an unsuccessful January transfer window. Obviously the circumstances were slightly different and Rangers were in a much more perilous position but the past few months have shown exactly how and how not to arrange a managerial succession. West Brom spotted the way things were going early, moved on their underperforming manager and brought in a proven relegation firefighter, whereas QPR dithered, let their own flailing boss decide his own fate and then gave the job to a coach with no previous managerial experience. Chris Ramsey seems like a decent man and under the right circumstances could probably be a good manager, but these are very much not the right circumstances. The two squads are of comparable quality, so imagine what difference they could have made if Tony Fernandes (who, admittedly, was understandably and rightly preoccupied with other matters at the time relating to the missing AirAsia plane) or Philip Beard recognised their side was only going one way and brought in Pulis, before West Brom or anyone else had got there. As it is QPR have somehow managed to get worse after Redknapp\xe2\x80\x99s departure, losing six of the seven games since Ramsey took the helm, while the Baggies have sauntered clear of trouble with only three league defeats in Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s time. QPR were actually one place above West Brom on the day Irvine was shown the door; a win for the Baggies on Saturday will put them 14 points clear. Coulda, woulda, shoulda.

Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s management team have a lot to answer for; their decision to organise a self-serving interview, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sanctioned by Liverpool, is baffling. But Sterling is by no means a victim here \xe2\x80\x93 and he has learned the hard way that contract particulars should not be Ayre-ed in public. He simply said he wants to earn lots of money and win lots of trophies. So what? He\xe2\x80\x99d probably even prefer to do it at Liverpool, if the club are willing to match his ambitions. That said, it is the timing that hurts for the fans and at the business end of the season, Liverpool supporters want to know Sterling and co are completely focused on the job at hand \xe2\x80\x93 reaching the Champions League \xe2\x80\x93 not what kind of contract or transfer their players may or may not receive. The England international has been heavily criticised for his comments, but with Daniel Sturridge again sidelined, Sterling is arguably Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s chief attacking threat for their match at Arsenal, where the Merseyside club have won only once in the last 19 matches. Sterling made a mistake, but he remains a young player that thrives on confidence. One would hope he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t shy away from playing his natural game, which can be so devastating when he takes risks in the final third. Receiving criticism from one\xe2\x80\x99s own fans can dent any player\xe2\x80\x99s confidence, so it will be interesting to see if Liverpool supporters cheer or jeer their man at the Emirates, perhaps at a time when they need him most.

Chelsea are six points clear at the top of the table with a game in hand, but should arguably be even further ahead, such is the quality in their squad and the inconsistency of everyone else. Sure, they have lost only two games all season and not at all since New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, but they have limply exited from the Champions League and FA Cup, dropped points against Burnley and Southampton and looked decidedly wobbly at Hull last time out. As the old clich\xc3\xa9 has it, the only team that can stop Chelsea winning the title is Chelsea themselves, but it sounds like Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho is doing his utmost to ensure his players do not make a frightful mess of things. \xe2\x80\x9cLike the great manager he is, he has told us what we need to do now, which is just to stay calm,\xe2\x80\x9d said Diego Costa this week. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s right because everything depends on us now. We know that the Premier League is complicated. It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy so we know we have to improve. We all need to dig in and give something extra because we have this title in our hands and we can\xe2\x80\x99t let it slip away.\xe2\x80\x9d Of course they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t slip up against Stoke this weekend \xe2\x80\x93 the Potters are coasting towards the end of the season, have not won at Stamford Bridge since earning promotion to the top flight in 2008, and indeed have only scored one goal there in that time (Rory Delap, if you\xe2\x80\x99re interested). The remainder of the season should be a procession to the title, but given the way things have gone this season, do not be too surprised if that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go to plan.

Photograph: Dave Thompson/Getty Images    <p>One of the main reasons Chelsea are sashaying clear of the rest is Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s dreadfully limp season. City were the only realistic candidates to challenge Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s men at the start of the campaign but have put up such a half-hearted defence of their title that Chelsea haven\xe2\x80\x99t needed to be especially good to basically have it wrapped up before Easter. It\xe2\x80\x99s reached the point now where Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s men look more likely to finish fourth than they do first, with Manchester United looking good and Arsenal also in fine form. Recent performances at Burnley and to a lesser extent Liverpool were desperate, and they face another potential problem at Selhurst Park on Monday night. Crystal Palace are now firmly snuggled in the warm safety of mid-table, the turnaround in form after Alan Pardew replaced Neil Warnock remarkable, and they\xe2\x80\x99re in fine recent form too, winning three of their last four. Glenn Murray is scoring goals, Wilfried Zaha finally looks like a Premier League player after being just too good for the Championship in his first spell at the club, while Jason Puncheon is quietly emerging as a pretty excellent No10. It\xe2\x80\x99s reached the point now where the reigning champions dropping points against a side who were in the relegation zone over Christmas wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really be much of a surprise.

Sort of. Colombia\xe2\x80\x99s talisman equalled his country\xe2\x80\x99s goals record over the international break (scoring twice against the not-so-sturdy Bahrain backline, and netting a penalty against Kuwait) and wasted no time in reminding Manchester United of his desire to \xe2\x80\x9cplay more minutes\xe2\x80\x9d before the end of the season is up. Louis van Gaal isn\xe2\x80\x99t likely to take any notice in selecting his XI for Aston Villa this Saturday. Falcao has started just one of the last six matches for United, and with Wayne Rooney combining well with Marouane Fellaini and Juan Mata at the sharp end in the recent wins over Tottenham and Liverpool, Falcao should be set for another stint on the Old Trafford bench. Early in the season, Van Gaal may have afforded the No9 a chance in the starting lineup in order to jump-start his United career, as he did in this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s reverse fixture at Villa Park. But as United enter the home straight, with Falcao almost certain to leave the club at the end of his loan this summer, these chances will be scant. Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s first objective is to ensure United finish at least fourth. If United do this with games to spare, his second will be to formulate his long-term plans for next season. For all his international form, Falcao is not likely to play a part in either. MB</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Falcao hopes for starring role in Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s run-in\xe2\x80\xa2 Fellaini is impossible to drop, says Van Gaal\xe2\x80\xa2 Dortmund\xe2\x80\x99s Hummels denies \xe2\x80\x98promise\xe2\x80\x99 to join Manchester United\xe2\x80\xa2 Carrick ready to be England\xe2\x80\x99s midfield linchpin at Euro 2016\xe2\x80\xa2 Sherwood focuses on Aston Villa\xe2\x80\x99s survival despite takeover talk</p>  6) Hull\xe2\x80\x99s attacking intent could be their undoing <p>Hull City\xe2\x80\x99s 3-5-2 formation continues to be a double-edged sword: in attack their wing backs are a constant menace: no other Premier League player has delivered more crosses from open play than Ahmed Elmohamady since the start of last season. But it is this attacking verve that exposes the three-man defence of Paul McShane, Alex Bruce and Michael Dawson, who are often unable to deal with genuine pace on the counterattack. Hull\xe2\x80\x99s opponents this weekend are Swansea, whose lightning-quick wingers include Nathan Dyer, Wayne Routledge and Jefferson Montero \xe2\x80\x93 all of whom will relish the chance to exploit Hull\xe2\x80\x99s wide areas on the break. Indeed, it was exactly this scenario which led to Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s winner against Aston Villa last time out: Montero breaking into space down the left flank before crossing for the unmarked Baf\xc3\xa9timbi Gomis. The Hull manager, Steve Bruce, will need to exercise caution before encouraging Elmohamady and the left wing-back Andrew Robertson to go forward if his side are to earn their eighth clean sheet of the season at the Liberty Stadium.

John Carver was always going to be a stop-gap, a willing and passionate stand-in for the club he supported as a lad, but unless he did something extraordinary then he would be pushed back into the shadows come the summer. Equally Dick Advocaat, who was brought in as a firefighter after Gus Poyet set the club ablaze and looks absolutely delighted just to be there, but the chances are Sunderland will move for either Steve McClaren or Sam Allardyce in the summer, rather than the avuncular Dutchman. Will that make a difference? Will it ramp things up given that both men will perhaps want to make a point? Strange as it might be to say, given Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s rotten form (they haven\xe2\x80\x99t won in the league since the end of January), they could well be favourites for this. Advocaat has had a couple of weeks to work with his squad and imbue any fancy ideas he has, while Newcastle will be without a number of key men, with Fabricio Coloccini and Papiss Ciss\xc3\xa9 suspended, and the likes of Steven Taylor and Cheick Tiot\xc3\xa9 injured. Of course, what good a win will do for Advocaat\xe2\x80\x99s long-term employment prospects is debatable, but it would certainly turn some frowns upside down on Wearside. NM</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Louise Taylor: Advocaat and Carver sweat on futures in north-east derby\xe2\x80\xa2 Guardian meets \xe2\x80\xa6 Kevin Phillips: \xe2\x80\x98Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s an incredible place to play\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\xa2 Police ready to take hard line at Sunderland versus Newcastle</p>  8) Reid is back, and West Ham are all the stronger for it <p>Sam Allardyce will be ruddy delighted that Winston Reid has recovered from injury, not least because it will allow the West Ham manager to move Cheikhou Kouyat\xc3\xa9 back into his favoured midfield role, where he has arguably been the club\xe2\x80\x99s stand-out performer this season. With the east London club suffering a spate of injuries in defence, Kouyat\xc3\xa9 has recently been used as a makeshift centre-back but his return to the middle of the pitch is long overdue. The 6ft 4in Senegalese has adapted superbly to the Premier League since his \xc2\xa37m move from Anderlecht last summer, and in an age where central midfielders are increasingly assigned specific roles, his all-action, box-to-box mentality has been refreshing to watch.</p> <p>Having now recovered from his hamstring strain, Reid has been given somewhat of a soft introduction back into Premier League life this weekend, facing a Leicester City attack that haven\xe2\x80\x99t scored in front of their own fans in over five hours, although Allardyce has admitted that the New Zealander is \xe2\x80\x9ca little bit rusty on match practice.\xe2\x80\x9d This is the first match for Reid since he signed a new six-and-a-half year contract last month and West Ham fans will be eager to see the best of the 26-year-old, now that the rumours of him moving away have died a death. MB</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Former West Ham player Collison still chasing his footballing dream</p>  9) Townsend should, believe it or not, pay attention to Merson <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s weird being on the same side of an argument as Paul Merson. The former Arsenal man is not, perhaps, the first person to call if you are bringing together a debating team, but he has got a point about Andros Townsend. \xe2\x80\x9cI think he should concentrate on playing football, to be honest, and don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about me,\xe2\x80\x9d Merson wrote in his Daily Star column, after Townsend, following his goal for England in Italy, had given it the Twitter big one in response to Merson doubting his place in the international side. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d also say win some medals first before you call it on. I have got no vendetta against him but I am not going to sit here and say he is top drawer \xe2\x80\xa6 he\xe2\x80\x99s just got back at Tottenham for the last seven or eight games. Where has he been all season?\xe2\x80\x9d Where has he been indeed? Townsend has only been in the Spurs side for the last five league games (six of the last seven in all competitions) and has been doing reasonably well, but Tottenham fans would be forgiven for wondering where all these international goals have been coming from. Townsend now has three in seven England appearances, exactly the same tally as in 44 league games for his club. \xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as the goal went in, I was just desperate to get that tweet out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Townsend. A few more goals and some better performances might be a bigger priority than giving a pundit what-for on Twitter.

Photograph: Jed Leicester/BPI/Rex    <p>This weekend marks exactly a year since Jay Rodriguez last played professional football. The 25-year-old has returned to first-team training but the only positive to come out of his horrific knee injury, as far as Southampton are concerned, is that he will not be leaving at the end of the season. That will not be the case for many of the club\xe2\x80\x99s stars this season and the manager, Ronald Koeman, is resigned to losing some of his key players. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s always good to have some changes in the team,\xe2\x80\x9d the Dutchman said on Thursday. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe, we will lose some players. We will do everything to keep everyone at the club, but we know the situation will be difficult. It will not be [as bad as] last season, but, of course, the risk is that we will lose some players. That\xe2\x80\x99s normal. That means we have to be prepared to bring in new players, new focus and we will see what position we are talking.\xe2\x80\x9d Morgan Schneiderlin and Nathaniel Clyne are the favourites to depart, while Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid have already confirmed that they are \xe2\x80\x9ccounting on\xe2\x80\x9d their on-loan defender Toby Alderweireld next season. Who Koeman will have left remains to be seen, and though he has thankfully declined to describe the returning Rodriguez as \xe2\x80\x98like a new signing\xe2\x80\x99, it looks as though there will need to be many new faces on the south coast come August.
