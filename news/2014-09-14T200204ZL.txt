b'<p>Louis van Gaal hailed a \xe2\x80\x9cfantastic\xe2\x80\x9d Manchester United performance but insisted his team will be much better and hopes they will end as the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s highest scorers after Queens Park Rangers were defeated 4-0 at Old Trafford.</p> <p>The victory was the first win of the season for United and the Dutchman, at the fifth attempt. By the close Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie, Juan Mata, Radamel Falcao and \xc3\x81ngel di Mar\xc3\xada had illustrated the attacking riches now at Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s disposal.</p> <p>Di Mar\xc3\xada\xe2\x80\x99s goal on his home debut, Ander Herrera\xe2\x80\x99s first for United, plus goals from Rooney \xe2\x80\x93 to make him the third highest Premier League goalscorer on 175 \xe2\x80\x93 and Mata lifted the club to ninth place with five points.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe have always to analyse what we have done. The result is fantastic but we can get much better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Van Gaal.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a good start. When you have a result of 4-0 then you can be happy as a coach but you always have points you can improve. We were very dominant and scored goals and kept a clean sheet.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Despite being seven points behind the leaders, Chelsea, Van Gaal has not ruled out claiming the title this term. \xe2\x80\x9cI have played always attack, I believe, and all my teams have scored the most of the league,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I hope at the end of this league we shall score also the most. The purpose is to be in the first three because we have to qualify ourselves in the Champions League but that is not the most important thing. The most important thing is trajectory.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe are building a process and we have to play in a certain style. We have to improve our qualifications and at the end I hope to be manager of the champion of the Premier League. If it is not this year, then in my second year or my third year but I want to give the championship to the fans.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Daley Blind, Marcos Rojo and Falcao, who was a second-half substitute, made their debuts and with United having added the unused substitute, Luke Shaw, plus Di Mar\xc3\xada and Herrera in the summer, Van Gaal determined that, having taken only two points prior to this match, it should be a fresh beginning.</p> <p>He said: \xe2\x80\x9cAs of September 1 we were only together for two or three days before the game, now the internationals are coming back. I said let\xe2\x80\x99s make a new start. All the new players are playing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>For the first time since taking over Van Gaal sent out a United XI that featured a four-man defence in a 4-1-3-2 system, rather than the 3-5-2 he has favoured. \xe2\x80\x9cI could hardly play with five defenders because [Chris] Smalling and [Phil] Jones were injured \xe2\x80\xa6 it would be difficult to play with three defenders because Tyler Blackett and [Jonny] Evans, maybe [Marcos] Rojo, he can also play central defender. But then I have to create a left-footed player as right-sided central defenders. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that is good,\xe2\x80\x9d he said before suggesting the four-man defence could remain. \xe2\x80\x9cI was more or less forced to play with two central defenders but it is also due to the quality of the players that I change the formation.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Gaal was understandably pleased with the \xc2\xa359.7m record signing, Di Mar\xc3\xada. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you prepare [create] three goals and make the first goal by yourself then you cannot play bad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he had a lot of unnecessary losses [of possession] so we can do better, even \xc3\x81ngel di Mar\xc3\xada. But can you do it better when you prepare three goals and make one? It is nearly impossible but I am analysing the game and I see things we can improve as a team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Angel Di Mar\xc3\xada winks at Louis Van Gaal after the Manchester United forward was substituted near the end of the victory over QPR.

Tyler Blackett has played a lot of 90 minutes. Rojo played with Argentina 90 minutes and that is it.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9c[Luke] Shaw is coming back from injury. Blind played two matches 90 minutes and one in the national team, so three. Then Di Mar\xc3\xada has never played 90 minutes until now in his pre-season and season. Herrera has also played, he was in the United States. Juan Mata also, Rooney also and [Robin] van Persie it is now the second match he played 90 minutes so that is our problem.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
