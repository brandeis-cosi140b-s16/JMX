b'Football transfer rumours: Is Aaron Lennon bound for Everton?'


b'<p>Sadly for the Mill, It\xe2\x80\x99s been a quiet January window so far. There has been tittle, sure, even a bit of tattle but the bottom line is that nothing much has really happened. And now the noise of a barrel scraping can be faintly heard in the distance.</p> <p>Still, the Mill will keep plugging away even as the speculation drifts into ever more unrealistic territory. Take, for example, the news that Tottenham are willing to offer Aaron Lennon to Everton in part exchange for Kevin Mirallas. It won\xe2\x80\x99t happen, of course \xe2\x80\x93 swap deals very rarely do \xe2\x80\x93 but there it is.</p> <p>And Chelsea want Fiorentina\xe2\x80\x99s Juan Cuadrado, he of the very fine World Cup with Colombia, to buzz around behind Diego Costa like everyone else. To make space they\xe2\x80\x99ll send Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle to Werder Bremen or Bayer Leverkusen and Mohamed Salah to Besiktas or Roma.</p> <p>Arsenal are back in for Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s Cheick Tiot\xc3\xa9. Because reasons.</p> <p>West Ham are ready to spend \xc2\xa32m on Hamilton defender and former world snooker champion Stephen Hendrie.</p> <p>Everton scouts have earned their Watching Almer\xc3\xada winger \xc3\x89dgar M\xc3\xa9ndez badge.</p> <p>West Brom and Tony Pulis have drawn up their survival masterplan. Point one is \xe2\x80\x9csign Nottingham Forest wing-beefcake Michail Antonio\xe2\x80\x9d. Other points include selling Graham Dorrans to Burnley in order to raise a bit of cash for a move for Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s Darren Fletcher.</p> <p>Spurs will offer Sporting Lisbon \xc2\xa36m in exchange for striker Islam Slimani, who has bagged seven goals in 11 appearances for the Portuguese giants this season.</p> <p>Alan Pardew wants Sevilla\xe2\x80\x99s St\xc3\xa9phane M\xe2\x80\x99Bia, wants him so bad he can almost taste him.</p> <p>And Axel Witsel wants to move to Manchester United.</p>'
