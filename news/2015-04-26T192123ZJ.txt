b"<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has shrugged off chants of \xe2\x80\x9cboring, boring Chelsea\xe2\x80\x9d from Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s support by suggesting a decade without a league title represents proper tedium as this goalless draw edged his team inexorably towards the Premier League trophy.</p> <p>The home fans bellowed their frustration as Chelsea, led superbly by John Terry whose performance was ranked as \xe2\x80\x9chis best\xe2\x80\x9d by the manager, curtailed the hosts\xe2\x80\x99 eight-match winning streak to leave them two wins from the championship.</p> <p>Victory against Leicester City on Wednesday will ensure Terry can hoist the title for the first time since 2010 by beating Crystal Palace on Sunday, with Mourinho quick to reject claims his team have rather ground out their success this term.</p>     Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho defends Chelsea from accusations of being boring by referring their superb scoring record. Photograph: Tony O'Brien/Action Images    <p>Arsenal, who ended the weekend third and still 10 points adrift of the top, have not claimed the championship since Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s Invincibles in 2003-04. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, \xe2\x80\x98boring\xe2\x80\x99 I think is 10 years without a title: that\xe2\x80\x99s very boring,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho, who also pointed to a perceived lack of ambition with the home side\xe2\x80\x99s substitutions.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou support a club and you\xe2\x80\x99re waiting, waiting, waiting for so many years without a Premier League title, so that\xe2\x80\x99s very boring. But maybe they aren\xe2\x80\x99t singing at us. Maybe, when you\xe2\x80\x99re the home side and you want to win a game but you take your No9 off [with six minutes remaining] \xe2\x80\xa6 maybe the home fans want to see [Danny] Welbeck and [Olivier] Giroud up front together.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe had a very good experience. The \xe2\x80\x98boring\xe2\x80\x99 team are the second highest scorers in the Premier League, and the team with the best goal difference. Only Manchester City have scored more goals than us. So I think we scored a lot of goals and, in a period where we don\xe2\x80\x99t have Diego Costa or Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my available and we have only one striker \xe2\x80\x93 who we have to rely on to help us with all the matches we have \xe2\x80\x93 we changed a bit our dynamic and we are not scoring so many goals as before. But, even so, we are the second-highest scorers.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Wenger, who has failed to defeat a Mourinho team in 13 meetings, conceded the title race was over. \xe2\x80\x9cChelsea will be champions,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Arsenal manager. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know that. It is impossible for them to lose it now.\xe2\x80\x9d His side rather ran aground here on the division\xe2\x80\x99s second stingiest defence, with C\xc3\xa9sar Azpilicueta, Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic and, in particular, Terry outstanding. That quartet celebrated together on the final whistle as if the trophy had been claimed.</p>           Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger: Chelsea will be Premier League champions    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI told John Terry in the dressing room he had [put in some] fantastic performances for me, but this was his best,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the best JT has ever played. It was absolutely amazing. He\xe2\x80\x99s had fantastic performances in the five or six years we worked together, and some of them with goals. One performance at Highbury, I think in my first season, was a fantastic performance too. But I think today everything was clean: reading the game, giving cover, leading the defensive line, making interceptions, even in the pass. The team was phenomenal, but John was one step ahead of every other player.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea will continue to monitor Oscar, who had started as a false No9 with Didier Drogba\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in training having been hampered by injury, after the Brazilian was clattered by David Ospina after 16 minutes. He was treated for a head injury on the pitch and, while he played on until the break, was taken to hospital at half-time to be assessed for signs of concussion. He is a doubt for Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Leicester, in which R\xc3\xa9my will not feature. Costa, who is training again after hamstring trouble, may make the trip to the east Midlands as the leaders seek the first of two wins they need to claim the title.</p> <p>Asked how his team would be remembered once they secure the five points required, Mourinho added: \xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all, we need to be champions. If we do that, and I think we are going to do that, we will be champions having been top of the league since day one. And being top of the league since day one, well, only top teams can do that. The team is very confident and playing extremely well so we know it is in our hands.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>"
