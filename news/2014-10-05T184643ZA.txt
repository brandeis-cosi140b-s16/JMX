b'Arsenal undone by Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s use of wide men and Eden Hazard\xe2\x80\x99s control | Michael Cox'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho is criticised for being too defensive, while Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s big-match team selection is often too adventurous \xe2\x80\x93 but there was something of a role reversal at Stamford Bridge.</p> <p>While Mourinho opted for his more attacking formation \xe2\x80\x93 a 4-2-3-1 with four attacking players joined by Cesc F\xc3\xa1bregas from deeper \xe2\x80\x93 Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s 4-1-4-1 indicated Arsenal would play more defensively.</p> <p>That caution extended to Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s overall play. During last season\xe2\x80\x99s 6-0 defeat in this fixture, Arsenal threw their full-backs forward immediately and were repeatedly ripped apart on the counter-attack, but this time they played with more patience. The full-backs were deeper, the midfield was more structured, and this was a scrappy, slow-burning contest with few goalscoring chances.</p> <p>The key feature of Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s victory was the movement of the two wide players. With Jack Wilshere and Santi Cazorla pushing up to shut down F\xc3\xa1bregas and Nemanja Matic, plus Mathieu Flamini drawn towards Oscar, pockets of space opened up for Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle and Eden Hazard to drift into. Both popped up in different positions throughout the first half, first receiving the ball towards the flanks, but then finding room between the lines. The more Chelsea had possession, the more Hazard and Sch\xc3\xbcrrle had license to vacate their wide positions.</p> <p>Kieran Gibbs coped well with Sch\xc3\xbcrrle, but on the opposite flank Arsenal had significant problems with Hazard. Calum Chambers was booked midway through the first half for a clumsy challenge on the Belgian near the touchline, but Hazard\xe2\x80\x99s key contribution came from a more central role. As Chelsea built play down the right, Hazard darted inside from the left when recognising there was space between the lines, received a pass from F\xc3\xa1bregas, then drove past Flamini and Chambers, and drew a foul from Laurent Koscielny. Hazard converted the spot-kick with typical confidence.</p> <p>Both managers changed formation after 69 minutes. Wenger introduced Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain for Cazorla, meaning Mesut Ozil could move inside into his favoured No10 position. Unfortunately for the German, his ex-Real Madrid manager Mourinho was busy bringing on John Obi Mikel to sit alongside Matic and protect that central zone.</p> <p>Chelsea shut down the game effectively, while offering a threat on the break too. Another Hazard run nearly forced Flamini into an own goal, while F\xc3\xa1bregas moved forward to link midfield and attack. His superb lofted through-ball for Diego Costa helped clinch the victory, but Hazard\xe2\x80\x99s unpredictable movement and tricky dribbling had put Chelsea in control.</p>'
