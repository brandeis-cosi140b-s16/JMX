b'Louis van Gaal says his Manchester United performance has been great'


b'<p>Louis van Gaal believes he is doing \xe2\x80\x9cgreat\xe2\x80\x9d as Manchester United manager and his players understand his philosophy but he still says they must perform better.</p> <p>The manager\xe2\x80\x99s self-stated three-month period for when he and the squad could be judged passed on Wednesday with United in fourth on 11 points.</p> <p>Van Gaal, who said he has only four of the team injured \xe2\x80\x93 Jesse Lingard, Antonio Valencia, Jonny Evans and Paddy McNair \xe2\x80\x93 was asked how he might assess his start as United\xe2\x80\x99s No1. \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, I\xe2\x80\x99m doing always great so that\xe2\x80\x99s a very easy question. Thank you for that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>While the Dutchman may have spoken in a light-humoured way he stated there was no other way to answer the next question on whether he thought United are heading in the right direction under him.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYes. How do I have to respond? When I respond then I\xe2\x80\x99m arrogant. Normally I\xe2\x80\x99m always moving in the right direction. How do I have to respond? Am I moving in the right direction? No? I have confidence in myself and my players but much more important is the players have confidence in the manager. It\xe2\x80\x99s tough. I\xe2\x80\x99m not doing that alone. I\xe2\x80\x99m doing it with the staff and the players.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>On whether he can be judged after three months Van Gaal said: \xe2\x80\x9cI hope so. We have to wait and see. I think they [players] do understand the philosophy but they have to perform that philosophyand we have to see if it is going at higher level. I think we need more balance in the team. I said that after the match against Everton [which was won 2-1]. I am looking for balance in the team, not only spectacular attacking football but, when you lose the ball that you have a shape as a team, andthatyou can defend more easily and that you can kill the game better.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat is also part of the philosophy. But because I\xe2\x80\x99m always choosing more creative, attacking football players so we are looking for that balance.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of his injury list, which had been as high as 10 players, the manager said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have only four players injured now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>While Van Gaal indicated that Phil Jones, Michael Carrick, Ashley Young and Chris Smalling are all back in full training, they may not be able to start against West Bromwich Albion on Monday evening. Ander Herrera, who still has a rib injury, \xe2\x80\x9ccould play in a corset\xe2\x80\x9d, Van Gaal told MUTV.</p> <p>Van Gaal hopes to record a third consecutive league win for a first time this term. But he warned West Brom will not be easy opponents. \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you say that phrase?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can lose in this sport. Only Chelsea didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose. West Bromwich Albion are difficult to beat, also at home. They play not only long balls but can play a possession game so it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to beat. There\xe2\x80\x99s no club in the Premier League that is easy to beat. That\xe2\x80\x99s the difference from other leagues I think.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
