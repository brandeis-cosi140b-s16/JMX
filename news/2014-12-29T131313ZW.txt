b'Why Fernando Torres\xe2\x80\x99 return to Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid can revitalise the Kid | Sid Lowe'


b'<p>The Kid returns to the Calder\xc3\xb3n a man. Fernando Torres has rejoined Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid more than 17 years after he played his first game for them, a tall, skinny 13-year-old with freckles who had recently joined the club\xe2\x80\x99s youth system. After Chelsea formalised his switch to Milan, the Serie A side confirmed he will join Atl\xc3\xa9tico on loan until 2016, when his contract at Stamford Bridge was due to expire. Alessio Cerci heads in the other direction, from Madrid to Milan. This is that rare deal when everyone is happy.</p> <p>It is seven and a half years since Torres left for Liverpool. His mind was made up after a soulless 6-0 defeat that confirmed a trend in which Atl\xc3\xa9tico headed from crisis to crisis, never winning anything and never looking like winning anything either. The surprise, the club\xe2\x80\x99s sporting director admitted, was not Torres had departed but that he had stayed so long. He was still young but he had completed his seventh season in the first team. He had scored 91 goals but also outgrown them. \xe2\x80\x9cI had to leave because my development was going in one direction and the club was going in another,\xe2\x80\x9d Torres said.</p> <p>Some will conclude the roles have been reversed. Under Diego Simeone, Atl\xc3\xa9tico have won the Europa League, the Copa del Rey, and the league, and reached the final of the Champions League, in the past three years. Torres became an idol of Anfield, scoring 54 goals in his first three seasons. He finished third in the Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or but he arrives home having scored once in 10 games at Milan and Chelsea were keen to get rid of him. Last season he scored five league goals; the seasons before that he got eight, six and one.</p> <p>Atl\xc3\xa9tico could not be happier. \xe2\x80\x9cThe tweet we were longing to write. It\xe2\x80\x99s official. Torres will wear the red and white shirt again. #TorresHasReturned\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9d, ran their Twitter feed on Monday morning. Germ\xc3\xa1n Burgos, Atl\xc3\xa9tico\xe2\x80\x99s assistant coach, said a few days ago that it would be \xe2\x80\x9cwonderful\xe2\x80\x9d if they could bring him back. When Torres was last at the club, Burgos was his team-mate. So was Simeone. Torres described this move as a \xe2\x80\x9cdream come true\xe2\x80\x9d; he is \xe2\x80\x9chome at last\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>It is hard to do justice to how much Torres means to Atl\xc3\xa9tico and their supporters. He is from Fuenlabrada, south of Madrid, and played his first competitive game for them aged 17 in May 2001. He will probably play his last competitive game for them, too. He is 30 now but here he will always be \xe2\x80\x9cEl\xc2\xa0 ni\xc3\xb1o\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>In 2000, Atl\xc3\xa9tico were relegated for the first time. The then owner Jes\xc3\xbas Gil described it as \xe2\x80\x9cone little year in hell\xe2\x80\x9d but it turned out to be two. Torres made his debut in hell, light amid the darkness \xe2\x80\x93 the hope to which they clung. They won promotion and he scored 75 goals in the five first division seasons that followed. If they did not progress, it was not because of him and when he departed most understood. He was still one of them.</p> <p>Torres\xe2\x80\x99 grandfather first took him to the Calder\xc3\xb3n and he identified with Atl\xc3\xa9tico as much as they would come to identify with him. Few explained the club\xe2\x80\x99s idiosyncrasies better, few internalised them better. Torres talked about being an Atl\xc3\xa9tico fan who felt outnumbered and had almost always lost but would not hide; about rivals who do not \xe2\x80\x9cfeel\xe2\x80\x9d their football like atl\xc3\xa9ticos do. In an interview with the magazine Panenka last summer, Torres said: \xe2\x80\x9cAtl\xc3\xa9tico has been my only home\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>This decision to return has not been built solely on romance, which is not to say that there is no romance. The emotional component is important: the hope is that in finding his place, Torres can find himself again. This decision feels right; others did not.</p> <p>Torres admitted that leaving Liverpool, or indeed anyone, \xe2\x80\x9cmid-season\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cinadvisable\xe2\x80\x9d. The way it was handled hurt too \xe2\x80\x93 Liverpool were in \xe2\x80\x9cchaos\xe2\x80\x9d, Torres said, and he was right. There was institutional uncertainty and the team who suited him so well was dismantled. Rafael Ben\xc3\xadtez had gone, Xabi Alonso and Javier Mascherano left, and when Torres did likewise the blame was turned on him. \xe2\x80\x9cThe [fans] were poisoned, sold a story that was not true,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>And so he went to Stamford Bridge, where he rarely seemed to fit in. He has hinted there may still be a story to tell about that and said in an interview with Lu Mart\xc3\xadn in El Pa\xc3\xads in 2012, that his mindset momentarily changed, something slipped and it saddened him.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI had team-mates who didn\xe2\x80\x99t care if the team won or lost because they weren\xe2\x80\x99t playing [and] I never wanted to be like that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut one day I discovered I was like them ... I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t happy because I had got away from what I wanted to be. In a dressing room, the team mentality should not be lost.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>At Atl\xc3\xa9tico things will be different for him. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will get the best out of him,\xe2\x80\x9d Burgos says. Simeone wanted to sign Torres last summer; six months later he has succeeded for a price that makes it virtually a no-risk move. Simeone has not been blinded by love.</p> <p>The headline statistics \xe2\x80\x93 those damning league goals versus league games tables \xe2\x80\x93 rarely take into account the fact that in the past four seasons 38 of Torres\xe2\x80\x99 appearances have been from the bench, often a few minutes long. Nor has style been looked at. There have been successes, even if they have been easily forgotten.</p> <p>Torres admits he has had a more \xe2\x80\x9csecondary\xe2\x80\x9d role than he would have liked but there have been trophies at Chelsea. So too with Spain ,\xe2\x80\x93 world and double European champions, it was Torres\xe2\x80\x99 goal that finally won them a major tournament, 44 years later.</p> <p>Simeone has taken all of that into account. He has watched, analysed and stayed in touch with his former team-mate. He believes Torres can add something to his side, that he still has much to contribute. He reckons the right team, environment and style, could still suit him.</p> <p>Of his first two years at Chelsea, Torres said: \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes I thought, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll run into space,\xe2\x80\x99 and for 70 minutes I didn\xe2\x80\x99t touch the ball.\xe2\x80\x9d. It was so different to what I was used to with Ben\xc3\xadtez that I was not comfortable and it showed.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ben\xc3\xadtez built a superb counterattacking team round him at Liverpool, playing to his strengths, and the success was dazzling. Chelsea did not play that way but Atl\xc3\xa9tico might \xe2\x80\x93 not in every game, not in every moment, but often. This is a different Torres but they believe he can still be useful</p> <p>Atl\xc3\xa9tico have evolved this season but that run into space, lost with the departure of Diego Costa, is a weapon Simeone would like to recover and Torres is a player Atl\xc3\xa9tico have wanted to recover too from the day he left.</p>'
