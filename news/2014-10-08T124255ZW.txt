b'Wayne Rooney taking England scoring record will be worth shouting about | Paul Wilson'


b'<p>Perhaps Wayne Rooney should celebrate a goal or two against San Marino on Thursday with the sort of muted, slightly embarrassed acknowledgement Frank Lampard attempted \xe2\x80\x93 not entirely successfully \xe2\x80\x93 on equalising for Manchester City recently against Chelsea.</p> <p>The England captain is on the verge of overtaking some notable individuals in the national team\xe2\x80\x99s all-time scoring chart and already the grumbling has started. Goals will come too easily against the calibre of opponents England have lined up in the next couple of years, it is being said, and Rooney himself is undeserving of the honour of toppling the scoring feats of Jimmy Greaves or Sir Bobby Charlton.</p> <p>Before entering into that somewhat specious argument, here are the facts.</p> <p>Rooney is currently on 41 international goals. Above him are Greaves, on 44 goals, Gary Lineker on 48, and Charlton with 49. Rooney turns 29 this month and has just been made captain of the England team, which means that barring injury or suspension, he is certain to play. England\xe2\x80\x99s opponents for the next 12 months are San Marino, Estonia, Slovenia, Scotland (friendly), Italy (f), Lithuania, Republic of Ireland (f), Slovenia, San Marino, Switzerland, Estonia.</p> <p>Do the math, as they say in the States. Even allowing for the emergence of Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck it will be a major surprise if Rooney is not closing in on Charlton\xe2\x80\x99s record by the end of that lot. People are being a bit sniffy about the prospect because England have never come close to winning anything during Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s career. He is seen as a talented member of a pedestrian team, an accumulator of unexciting goals in an ordinary cause. He cannot possibly compete with Charlton or Greaves, whose feats were inextricably linked to the romance of 1966 \xe2\x80\x93 even if the latter famously missed Alf Ramsey\xe2\x80\x99s final cut \xe2\x80\x93 or even Lineker, who in 1990 was part of the side that came closest to reaching another World Cup final.</p> <p>But is that Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s fault? He was born in 1985, and came to prominence with Everton shortly after the 2002 World Cup, when England were already into the pattern of slow decline that prompted them to seek inspiration from foreign managers. No England manager, from Sven-Goran Eriksson to Fabio Capello to Roy Hodgson, would ever complain that Rooney let them down, although Capello might have wished he had controlled his temper better that night in Podgorica when he earned a suspension for the opening matches at Euro 2012. Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s performances and goalscoring have been fairly consistent over the years. He has helped England through some lean times when few other candidates were available to lead the attack, and he has not been helped by the injuries \xe2\x80\x93 notably in 2004 and 2006 \xe2\x80\x93 that rendered England a lesser force without him.</p> <p>He has been a great servant of the England cause, as will presumably be acknowledged when he joins the century club in another three caps, and a performer who has been both the youngest player to appear for England (February 2003) and the youngest to score for England is surely entitled to warm congratulations if he breaks records at the other end of his career by continuing to play effectively 11 years later. This has already been one of the great England careers. Of course it would be all the greater had it brought Rooney within touching distance of a World Cup but no one is more conscious of that than the player himself.</p> <p>Other modern centurions such as Lampard, Steven Gerrard and Ashley Cole probably feel the same way, but that does not mean time will judge them harshly. Plenty of other England legends \xe2\x80\x93 Tom Finney, Billy Wright, David Beckham \xe2\x80\x93 did not win a World Cup either, while some of the players who did, such as George Cohen (37) or Nobby Stiles (28), fell some way short of completing a half century of caps.</p> <p>It is all to do with the date of your birth and the strength of the national side with which you grow up. One sincerely doubts that players such as Nat Lofthouse, with an incredible strike rate of 30 goals from 33 appearances, or Tommy Lawton (22 in 23) ever felt that the honour of being called up for England was compromised by the absence of a World Cup trophy on the mantelpiece and, now that England are once again as far away from World Cup glory as they were in the 40s and 50s it seems unfair to use global failure as a stick with which to beat individuals. Fair enough, the present European Championship qualifying procedure is ridiculously easy, but back in the day Charlton, Greaves and co used to get easy games too, not least a regular supply of home internationals. Should Rooney end up with a century of caps and a half century of goals, fair play to him.</p> <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s all his own work. The fact that he has been more handsomely rewarded for that work than anyone before him should not count against him either. A certain amount of nostalgia is permissible for the days when you could encounter footballers on public transport, or when, according to Alan Ball, a World Cup winner could travel back up north with his dad and stop for a meal at a motorway service station with his Wembley medal in his back pocket, but it is perhaps as well that record books tend not to show that sort of detail. While comparing players from different eras is always going to be difficult, the stark columns indicating appearances and goals scored remain the most reliable guide.</p> <p>For that reason, the one statistic that does put Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s career into an unflattering perspective is his single goal at a World Cup finals, achieved this summer in defeat against Uruguay. A striker who appeared in the 2006, 2010 and 2014 tournaments ought to have done a little better than that, one feels, even if his opportunities were somewhat limited by England\xe2\x80\x99s habit of bowing out early. The only England striker who shows up well on the all-time World Cup chart is Lineker, whose 10 goals in the 1986 and 1990 tournaments earn him a place on the leaderboard unlikely to be challenged by anyone from this country any time soon. As Lineker remains the only England player to top-score at a tournament \xe2\x80\x93 with six at Mexico 86 \xe2\x80\x93 his place in posterity appears secure enough, even if Rooney edges past him in the overall goalscoring list. So too does Geoff Hurst\xe2\x80\x99s, who is England next highest World Cup scorer with five, although three of them came on the same afternoon. Beyond that, the haul is meagre, with only Charlton, Lofthouse, Roger Hunt and David Platt reaching three goals in one tournament. For purposes of comparison, Germany have players who have done that at no fewer than 30 tournaments. Helmut Haller\xe2\x80\x99s six goals in 1966 would have been enough to place him second in the English list, ahead of Charlton, while in the 1990 World Cup Germany had four players \xe2\x80\x93 J\xc3\xbcrgen Klinsmann, Rudi V\xc3\xb6ller, Lothar Matth\xc3\xa4us and Andreas Brehme \xe2\x80\x93 weighing in with three goals or more. But Germany are exceptional at World Cups, England are not. Germany at the moment sparkle with talent, and goalscoring ability, right through the team. England do not, and that makes Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s long and sometimes lonely assault on the record books all the more impressive.</p>'
