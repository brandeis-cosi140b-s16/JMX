b'Ligue 1 hopes FFP won\xe2\x80\x99t stifle import of top players to PSG and Monaco | Nick Ames'


b'<p>It was not the worst mistake of Paris Saint-Germain\xe2\x80\x99s draw with Monaco but it displayed the most glaring lack of coordination and thus drew the loudest howls. Edinson Cavani had been sent through by Thiago Motta \xe2\x80\x93 the latter making a rare burst towards the penalty area as space opened up early in the second half \xe2\x80\x93 and had a clear shot at Danijel Subasic from the inside-left position. Should score? It was his weaker side, but arguably. Should make the keeper work? Definitely. Instead Cavani, his bearings all wrong, kicked fresh air as limbs travelled at 90 degrees to the ball, which eventually went out for a corner. It darkened the pall of gloom developing around his time at Parc des Princes and \xe2\x80\x93 in a match where skirmishes inside either penalty area were uniformly scrappy \xe2\x80\x93 fitted the evening\xe2\x80\x99s own narrative well enough.</p> <p>Cavani\xe2\x80\x99s miss brought to mind a conversation between Mathieu Ficot, chief commercial officer of France\xe2\x80\x99s Ligue de Football Professionnel (LFP) and a group of English journalists a couple of days previously. The French league\xe2\x80\x99s need for star names was a recurring theme and Ficot was musing, unprompted, about the kind of player that could raise \xe2\x80\x93 and already has raised \xe2\x80\x93 its profile.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cCavani, I still don\xe2\x80\x99t know if we can qualify him as a football star,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9c[Zlatan] Ibrahimovic is a football star, [David] Luiz, [Radamel] Falcao and now James [Rodr\xc3\xadguez] since the World Cup \xe2\x80\x93 we need this kind of guy to attract curiosity and interest from all around the world.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>If it seems hard on Cavani, the outstanding Uruguay striker whose apparently unsatisfactory 15 months in Paris have brought 29 goals in 51 appearances, it speaks more of a concern in France about Ligue 1\xe2\x80\x99s ability to follow up on the engagement and publicity generated by PSG and Monaco\xe2\x80\x99s new-found wealth and relative success. One does not have to read far between the lines to conclude that the sight of Cavani\xe2\x80\x99s athletic but sometimes unsubtle frame leading the line for Laurent Blanc\xe2\x80\x99s team is considered insufficient to make the division\xe2\x80\x99s appeal stick. The departures of Falcao and Rodr\xc3\xadguez from Monaco, largely brought on by a change of direction from the owner, Dmitry Rybolovlev, in face of Financial Fair Play regulations, posed an unwelcome reminder that it has just become more difficult than ever to build and resource a European superpower from a position of anything other than existing strength.</p> <p>On the pitch Ibrahimovic\xe2\x80\x99s absence through injury seemed a contributing factor to a lack of intensity in the atmosphere between France\xe2\x80\x99s two new heavyweights. It was a match that had captured Europe\xe2\x80\x99s imagination a year ago but now, with neither side having started well in the league and big names either injured or sold on, it presented little more than an added item of interest in a crowded weekend.</p> <p>It goes to show that some cake is required beneath the icing but Ficot explained there are much wider battles to fight to create a product of sustainable global draw to match those of England and Spain.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as language and history are concerned, the Premier League and La Liga have really benefited,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Spanish league is almost No1 in South America and is increasingly competitive in the US. The Premier League has many markets but \xe2\x80\x93 taking Africa as an example \xe2\x80\x93 all the richest countries on that continent are Anglophone; the Francophone countries are the poorest. In Asia all the very dynamic markets like Singapore and Hong Kong, Australia to a certain extent, had amazingly strong bonds with England.</p>     Zlatan Ibrahimovic of PSG, left, is seen as the kind of acquisition French sides need to make to attract interest on a global level. Photograph: Jean Catuffe/Getty Images    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFrance doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have assets of this kind. We are not used to being open to the world. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure we are the most competitive actors on the market. When it comes to diplomacy and soft power we are there but our industry and communications aren\xe2\x80\x99t really.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It is why Financial Fair Play, which has pressed the \xe2\x80\x9coff\xe2\x80\x9d switch on Monaco\xe2\x80\x99s spending for now (although the impact on PSG, whose Qatari ownership may have more strings to its bow than Rybolovlev\xe2\x80\x99s individual fortune, is less clear), comes at a particularly inopportune time for French football, with existing strongholds abroad operating from positions of historical advantage and Ligue 1 in danger of seeing its new-found glittering image peeled back.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very tricky moment with FFP \xe2\x80\x93 a tricky topic,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Ficot. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course we will officially support it, because that creates a virtuous cycle. But remember that the Premier League benefited years ago from massive investment; you need that to be successful in the short term; otherwise it takes a very long time.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Lyon dominated Ligue 1 in the 2000s it didn\xe2\x80\x99t need the means required now to be successful at European level. But we all know, more or less, the name of the Champions League quarter-finalists now and the trend is that it will probably be the same teams over and over.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Monaco\xe2\x80\x99s vice-president, Vadim Vasilyev, spoke similarly before Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s game: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s evident that it is much easier for well-established clubs with strong revenues to maintain their leading positions and in today\xe2\x80\x99s context it\xe2\x80\x99s almost impossible to develop a project such as Chelsea, at the time, or PSG and Manchester City recently,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhether it\xe2\x80\x99s for the good of European football I\xe2\x80\x99m not the one to judge but this is definitely one of the effects.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut these are the rules, we respect them and we are cooperating with Uefa to comply with them. However, I do think there will be an evolution of FFP to take into account the large diversity of countries and clubs for the benefit of European football.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>For the moment Monaco continue along a new, academy-based strategy that is unlikely to be a quick win commercially even if the club insist vehemently that they are not going away. It puts added pressure on the wider Ligue 1 product, although the disparity between its regular Champions League qualifiers and the rest in today\xe2\x80\x99s market is clear: PSG received more than \xe2\x82\xac55m for their run to last season\xe2\x80\x99s quarter-finals; clubs in Ligue 1 that have not qualified for Europe \xe2\x80\x93 14 in number this season \xe2\x80\x93 shared \xe2\x82\xac10m in Uefa \xe2\x80\x9csolidarity payments\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>The start made by Marseille \xe2\x80\x93 they sit five points clear of second-placed Bordeaux, seven ahead of PSG and 11 up from Monaco \xe2\x80\x93 is therefore a welcome tonic. They were the beneficiaries of around \xe2\x82\xac30m of their owner Margarita Louis-Dreyfus\xe2\x80\x99s money during the summer and Ficot \xe2\x80\x93 who more than once alluded to France\xe2\x80\x99s 75% high-earner\xe2\x80\x99s tax as another major inhibiting factor \xe2\x80\x93 lives in hope that others may see similar investment.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI really hope that some investors will one day look at France a little bit differently and that we build a strong product,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI would say that one of our assets is the number of teams that could be competitive in France, in comparison with other leagues. Maybe we have a balanced league with more suspense.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In the meantime big performances will do no harm in mitigating any big-name drain. PSG\xe2\x80\x99s win over Barcelona last week was a reminder that Ligue 1 has, regardless of any uncertainty, come a long way.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe need football stars and we need great European performances,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ficot. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s a kind of prestige victory that gives a highlight to PSG and French football in general.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>PSG walk out at Camp Nou in December. Were Cavani to keep his feet and score there it would brighten his club\xe2\x80\x99s star, that of his league and, perhaps, even his own.</p> <p>BT Sport brings fans multiple live games from France\xe2\x80\x99s Ligue 1 every week as part of a continental European football line-up including Uefa Europa League, Germany\xe2\x80\x99s Bundesliga, Italy\xe2\x80\x99s Serie A and the Portuguese Primera Liga alongside top-flight British football from the Barclays Premier League, FA Cup and Scottish Professional Football League</p>'
