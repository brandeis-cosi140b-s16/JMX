b'<p>Quiz question: which football club played one match but won two trophies on the same afternoon? OK, let\xe2\x80\x99s not completely rule out the possibility Chelsea might be overhauled in the Premier League but if there is a soft centre to this team they are doing pretty well at disguising it so far. The first trophy of Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s second coming is on the board and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel presumptuous to think the second is starting to look like a fait accompli on the back of Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s latest act of generosity.</p> <p>Mourinho and his players certainly had every right to milk those long celebrations at the end when the suspended Nemanja Matic appeared in full kit, emulating John Terry\xe2\x80\x99s change of costume after the 2012 Champions League final, and Mourinho could be seen throwing himself on to a sodden pitch at the expense of another designer suit. The laundry bill won\xe2\x80\x99t be cheap, but what are a few grass stains when the streets of west London should be preparing for another open-top bus parade?</p>  <p> Related: Chelsea v Tottenham Hotspur: Capital One Cup final \xe2\x80\x93 in pictures </p>   <p>Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s team had to withstand some concerted pressure before taking control of this final but once they were in charge they played with an expertise that made their opponents look callow. There is no better team when it comes to holding the lines, sizing up their opponents then gradually turning the screw. At times, it might not make for the most absorbing spectacle. Yet it is just one of the reasons why Mourinho hoards trophies in the way other people collect stamps. Chelsea have now won five League Cups, moving level with Aston Villa and putting them second only to Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s eight. Mourinho is responsible for three of them and it won\xe2\x80\x99t bother him in the slightest that they did it with such a pair of scruffy goals.</p> <p>For Spurs, this was the second competition they had exited in four days and the end housing their supporters was almost deserted by the time the beaten players went up to collect their medals. Mauricio Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s side started vibrantly but they had no response when Chelsea took the lead and, ultimately, the teams could be separated by the quality of their defending. John Terry and Gary Cahill, flanked by Branislav Ivanovic and C\xc3\xa9sar Azpilicueta, formed an impenetrable barrier in front of Petr Cech. Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s defence, in stark contrast, is still a work in progress.</p> <p>The second goal was a particular ordeal for Kyle Walker because it did not need a sitting of the Dubious Goals Panel to realise that Diego Costa\xe2\x80\x99s shot was heading across the six-yard area until the Spurs right-back jutted out his foot and inadvertently turned it into the gap between Hugo Lloris and the goalkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s near post.</p> <p>Yet it was the collective failure for the opening goal, one for the Dubious Defending Panel, that probably summed up the difference between the sides. There was a mistimed header, a couple of deflections and very little in the way of good luck, perhaps. Yet there was a degree of carelessness, too, and that is the point. John Terry made the decisive contact, lashing in the loose ball, then quickly went back to making sure his own defence was not so generous. His performance reminded us he is still the outstanding centre-half in the country, typified by that moment in the 87th minute when he, the oldest player on the pitch, could be seen throwing himself into a brilliant challenge to keep out Harry Kane.</p>  <p> Related: Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho: it\xe2\x80\x99s the first cup for new Chelsea team, a new generation </p>   <p>Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s disappointment should be compounded by the fact they had actually been the better side until the first goal. Danny Rose was pushing forward from his left-back spot. Walker was doing the same on the right while Nabil Bentaleb and Ryan Mason both started encouragingly. Kane also looked determined to leave his mark on the occasion. The striker eluded three Chelsea players with one early run and when the fourth, Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas, chopped him down Christian Eriksen smacked the free-kick against the crossbar.</p> <p>Chelsea certainly took their time to get going. Mourinho paid Kurt Zouma the ultimate compliment afterwards, describing him as \xe2\x80\x9cour new Marcel Desailly\xe2\x80\x9d but early on he looked slightly lost in his experimental position filling in for the suspended Matic. Eden Hazard was lively and keen to run at Walker but Chelsea struggled at first to exert their usual control and their attacking moments were notable mostly for the number of occasions when Costa, their troublemaker extraordinaire, became locked in the usual niggling duels.</p> <p>Eric Dier was maybe a touch unfortunate to be booked for a challenge on the half-hour mark but, having been shown that yellow card, the centre-half was lucky his little kick on Costa at the end of the first half went unnoticed. Later, Dier jumped so high into the back of Azpilicueta his knee struck his opponent\xe2\x80\x99s head and the Spaniard had to be bandaged for the rest of the match.</p> <p>Everything started to unravel for Spurs a minute before half-time when Willian\xe2\x80\x99s free-kick skimmed off Rose\xe2\x80\x99s head, ricocheted off Dier and dropped invitingly for Terry. Dier did his best to make amends, desperately trying to charge down the shot, but the ball deflected off his instep and Terry had his sixth goal of the season.</p> <p>Walker\xe2\x80\x99s own goal arrived 11 minutes into the second half after F\xc3\xa0bregas\xe2\x80\x99s pass had created the shooting opportunity for Costa, running through the left-hand channel. Spurs did briefly try to spirit a late comeback but there was not enough from Kane and Eriksen to threaten such a parsimonious defence and there was an air of inevitability for the last half an hour. \xe2\x80\x9cThe perfect day\xe2\x80\x9d, Mourinho called it, with the mud still visible on his suit.</p> <p>Man of the match John Terry (Chelsea)</p>'
