b'Has any team ever used more than Blackpool\xe2\x80\x99s 51 players in a season? | The Knowledge'


b'<p>What\xe2\x80\x99s the highest number players used by a club in a Football League season?\xe2\x80\x9d wonders @onedavebamber on Twitter. \xe2\x80\x9cBlackpool have now used 50 (plus three on bench).\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>A club that last summer had only eight professionals on their books and named their team for a pre-season friendly in Penrith as: Trialist, Waddington, Trialist, Perkins, McMahon, Dunne, Zenjov, Trialist, Trialist, Grant, Trialist (Subs: Barkhuizen, Trialist, Highan, Telford, Moulden, Gregory and Trialist) were always going to be in for a tricky season. Considering they had a first-team squad consisting of fewer players than needed for a first XI, you could argue they\xe2\x80\x99ve done pretty well to reach a half-century of players used before the end of March.</p> <p>The Tangerines have made 42 signings since the start of July, with 54 different names appearing on the matchday team sheet and all but three of them making it on to the pitch at some point. The net result? Four league wins all season and a plummet towards the third tier.</p> <p>But (for now) Blackpool\xe2\x80\x99s long-suffering fans have been denied even the pyrrhic victory of setting a record for the number of players used in a season. That unwanted record (by our reckoning) still belongs to the hapless Darlington side of 2009-10, who managed to utilise a whopping 54 players during their completely successful bid to remain at the bottom of League Two all season and drop into the Conference without a trace.</p> <p>Much like Blackpool, the Quakers began 2009-10 unsure about the season ahead after a summer spent building a team from scratch \xe2\x80\x93 the previous season they had finished 12th, and would have been in the play-offs had they not suffered a 10-point deduction for entering administration, but raft of players had departed. The club had flirted with liquidation but by August had emerged from administration, appointed Colin Todd as manager and set their sights on rebuilding.</p> <p>It didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite go according to plan. The season began with a 3-1 defeat at Aldershot and their first 12 games yielded a grand total of four goals and two points. Steve Staunton replaced Todd and was then replaced by Simon Davey, free transfers and loans arrived on an almost weekly basis, but results did not pick up. When 16-year-old forward Jordan Marshall made his debut from the subs bench three games from the end of the season he became the 54th player used by the club in the campaign. Spare a thought for Ian Miller, who amid the chaos managed to start 40 of their 46 league games and probably had a difficult time remembering some of his team-mates\xe2\x80\x99 names.</p> <p>Has anyone used more than 54 players in a season? Let us know at the usual address: knowledge@theguardian.com</p> BROTHERS WITH BRACES <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHave brothers ever scored a brace each in the same game before?\xe2\x80\x9d ponders Ben Bagnall. \xe2\x80\x9cIt happened in Ireland last week with the Dennehy brothers scoring twice for Cork City in their 5-0 win over Limerick.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI must mention Icelandic twin legends Arnar and Bjarki Gunnlaugsson,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Pall Eirikur Kristinsson. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile playing for their home town club IA Akranes in the 1995 season the twins managed to score all five IA goals in a 5-1 win over IBV on the final day of the season. Arnar scored a hat-trick, Bjarki scored a brace and IA won the title.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn two games in the 1992 season the brothers managed four goals between them (in a 4-0 win over FH and a 7-1 win over IBV) but in both cases Arnar Gunnlaugsson scored a hat-trick and Bjarki Gunnlaugsson one goal. IA Akranes won the title that year too.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Gustaf Hannibal Olafsson handily sends in the YouTube footage from that 5-1 game in 1995 for those who want to see the brothers in action: </p>            <p>But Sean DeLoughry can go a little better than that: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Sharbini brothers scored a hat-trick each in Rijeka\xe2\x80\x99s 6-0 win over Lokomotiva in the Croatian top flight in 2009,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe brothers very politely took turns. Big brother Ahmad opened the scoring after four minutes, little brother Anas doubled the lead on 27 and Ahmad made it 3-0 on 35. In the second half Anas converted a penalty on 51, Ahmad completed his hat-trick on 68 and two minutes later Anas set up an inevitable sibling quarrel over who exactly owns the match ball by scoring his third.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> MANAGERS SACKED AT THE LAST (2) <p>Last week we looked at the latest points in a season at which a club has sacked a manager and discovered that Coventry City were something of a form horse in this regard, with the club having sacked Roland Nilsson in 2002 and Eric Black in 2004 with one game of the campaigns remaining.</p> <p>And rather pleasingly Coventry City\xe2\x80\x99s official historian Jim Brown has been in touch to point out that the club had form for that sort of thing even earlier.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou are quite correct about the two Coventry managers sacked with one game to go,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Jim. \xe2\x80\x9cNeither Nilsson nor Black had anything to play for unlike another Coventry manager, Don Mackay in 1985-86. He was sacked with three games to go following a 0-5 thrashing at Anfield and replaced by the double act of George Curtis and John Sillett. The side were relegation favourites but the double act guided the side to two wins and one defeat with the final day victory over QPR saving the club from relegation. A year later the famous management team led the Sky Blues to victory in the FA Cup final.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>An even later dismissal when the club still had something to play for came at Selhurst Park in 2001. \xe2\x80\x9cCrystal Palace sacked Alan Smith with two games of the 2000-01 season to go,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Simon Hatchman. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were in the Championship drop zone and needed to win both of their remaining games \xe2\x80\x93 away to Pompey and (hard to believe these days) Stockport \xe2\x80\x93 to avoid dropping to the third tier for the first time since 1978.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSteve Kember was brought in to perform the miracle act and duly delivered \xe2\x80\x93 ably assisted by Dougie Freedman, who played like a man possessed in those two games. One of Simon Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s more inspired crazy decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d Which is saying something.</p> KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI found this medical paper which claims that when a team loses at home the rate of fatal heart attacks and strokes in the area shows a significant rise. Is this for real? And are there any other known proven health risks involved in being a football supporter?\xe2\x80\x9d enquired Mark Ireland back when all this were fields, a Mars bar cost 20p and you could leave your door unlocked when you went on holiday \xe2\x80\x93 2007.</p> <p>The medical paper you quote is certainly for real, Mark - and, what\xe2\x80\x99s more, research shows that watching football can affect your sight and your insides too.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cA colleague and I published a couple of articles relating to vision and the watching of football matches in an optometrists journal,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Dr Peter Howarth, from the Visual Ergonomics Research Group at Loughborough University. \xe2\x80\x9cIn essence, we showed how the viewing of moving black-and-white striped patterns can improve vision, which was a finding consistent with a new treatment for amblyopia (reduced vision) that had been developed at Cambridge a few years earlier.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn addition, we suggested (although we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have conclusive proof) that when the ball was consistently kicked into the air, there was a slight reduction in visual performance for spectators (akin to the short-sightedness seen in feature-free environments, and known as \xe2\x80\x98empty-field myopia\xe2\x80\x99 or the short-sightedness seen at night or \xe2\x80\x98night myopia\xe2\x80\x99).\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>If making you blind wasn\xe2\x80\x99t bad enough, football also seems to be bad for your gut, as Paddy MacLachlan explains. \xe2\x80\x9cDuring the 1997-98 season, the director of clinical psychiatry at the University of Florence and the chief gastroenterologist at the city\xe2\x80\x99s Careggi Hospital happened to notice a significant rise in people, almost all of them males, coming into hospital with stomach upsets in the days after Fiorentina had lost a match,\xe2\x80\x9d he recalls. \xe2\x80\x9cMany of these upsets were attributed to the Elico bacterium, which produces ulcer-like growths when stimulated by anger and frustration.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>But Paddy\xe2\x80\x99s got more. \xe2\x80\x9cPsychologist Dr Paul Bernhardt conducted an experiment for the University of Utah, in which he collected saliva samples from a group of Italy fans and Brazil fans immediately before and after the 1994 World Cup final. It showed that the Brazilians\xe2\x80\x99 testosterone level surged to 20% above normal as a result of the game, while the Italians\xe2\x80\x99 dropped below normal by exactly the same amount after they\xe2\x80\x99d lost on penalties. \xe2\x80\x98I think this confirms a lot of people\xe2\x80\x99s notions that serious sports fans really do seem to be affected by their teams,\xe2\x80\x99 said Bernhardt. \xe2\x80\x98This is not just happening in the mind, it\xe2\x80\x99s happening in the whole person.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>For thousands more questions and answers take a stroll along the dusty corridors of the Knowledge archive.</p> (A bumper edition of) Can you help? <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI recently won my 20th consecutive league and cup double on Fifa,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Stefan Glosby, who probably needs to change his difficulty level. \xe2\x80\x9cIt made me wonder which team hold the record (in real life, obviously) for most consecutive doubles? I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I read about Dinamo Tblisi winning six on the trot in the 90s, but has anyone done better?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIncreasing numbers of Blades fans are becoming despondent with Nigel Clough\xe2\x80\x99s inability to present an automatic promotion challenge despite signing 20 players this season,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Liam Blizard. \xe2\x80\x9cPromotion via the play-offs remains a possibility, but when was the last time a manager was given the boot after leading their team to promotion?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cJordan Henderson started the Manchester United game as Liverpool captain,\xe2\x80\x9d begins Arthur Porter. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had the armband taken off him before taking it back after Steven Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s sending off. Has that ever happened before?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt occurred to me watching Arsenal last night that Danny Wellbeck is fortunate enough to have played under arguably the two greatest managers of the Premier League era and he must be in a select group to do so,\xe2\x80\x9d begins Mike Shreeve. \xe2\x80\x9cI can only think of two other players \xe2\x80\x93 Robin van Persie and Mika\xc3\xabl Silvestre \xe2\x80\x93 to have done so. Which leads to my question: which two managers have most players in common \xe2\x80\x93 ie to have played under both. Steve Bruce and Alex Ferguson would be my best bet.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy team, Montpellier, finished bottom of the Ligue 1 fair-play table last season with an appalling record, including 14 red cards,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Ren\xc3\xa9 Dumont. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, they have improved dramatically and are on top of the same table, having received only 36 yellow cards and no red card in 28 games. Can any team better this redemption?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSo I was watching the highlights of the CAF U20 African Youth Championship semi-final between Nigeria and Ghana,\xe2\x80\x9d begins Tobi Amoo, \xe2\x80\x9cand I observed as Musa Muhammed, Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s buccaneering right-back and captain, blasted the ball into the net from the penalty spot for the second goal, that would make him the highest scorer at the tournament with four goals, having scored three goals earlier in the group stage, all from the penalty spot. The question is: has a player won the Golden Boot at any tournament, club or country, by scoring only penalties?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSunil Chettri, the Nepali-born Indian player, this week scored a brace to send my country, Nepal, out of the World Cup qualifiers,\xe2\x80\x9d laments Gaurab Shrestha. \xe2\x80\x9cHas anybody ever done this before to the nation of their birth?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cChris Eagles scored for Charlton against Blackpool in their 3-0 victory last week,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Tom Wilkinson. \xe2\x80\x9cEarlier in the season, he scored against Charlton while playing for Blackpool, in the 2-2 draw at The Valley. Not counting own goals, is this the first time a player has scored for both sides in the corresponding fixtures in the same season?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always been curious about this one: Who was the first player to pull a mask out of his shorts and gambol about the pitch like a frisky colt after scoring a goal?\xe2\x80\x9d wonders John Varlas.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBarnet have had players sent off against them in nine out of our 40 fixtures so far this season,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Barnet fan Rafi Cooper. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this some kind of record? What\xe2\x80\x99s the most number of games in a season that teams have played against 10 men (or fewer)?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLooking at Wade Elliot\xe2\x80\x99s career stats (as you do), I notice that he\xe2\x80\x99s played for five teams, all beginning with \xe2\x80\x98b\xe2\x80\x99: Bashley Bournemouth, Birmingham, Burley and Bristol City,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Daniel Jones. \xe2\x80\x9cHas any other player had such an alliterative career?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOn the proviso that Chelsea will win the Premier League this season, this question came to me,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Shane Williams. \xe2\x80\x9cWould Thibaut Courtois become the first goalkeeper (or even the first player) to win the top division league title in a foreign country while on loan from his parent club, and then win the top division league title for his parent club in consecutive seasons?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com</p>'
