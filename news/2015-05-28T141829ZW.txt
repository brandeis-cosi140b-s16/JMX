b'Were your pre-season predictions accurate? They were better than last year'


b'<p>Sometimes a newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s readers can benefit from having a forgiving arm laid upon their sunken shoulders but, in some extreme cases, when readers have truly embarrassed themselves, they have to be confronted with the brutal truth. This time last year, when we looked back at your predictions for the 2013-14 Premier League season and saw our awful they were, we realised that no amount of mollycoddling would help you improve: you needed to hear it straight. </p> <p>You had become complacent and needed to be shaken from your malaise, so you were admonished accordingly. We asked for expressions of guilt, regret, embarrassment and remorse in the comments section and, while very few of you saw fit to admit the error of your ways, you clearly digested the criticism and vowed to respond in the best way possible: by answering more questions right this year.</p> <p>Sure, when the polls were published, you predicted that Daniel Sturridge would win the Golden Boot and that West Brom and Leicester City would be relegated, but your answers were much-improved and generally sound. You foresaw that Chelsea would be champions, you knew Burnley would struggle and you were right to anticipate great seasons for Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez, Cesc F\xc3\xa1bregas and Diego Costa at their new clubs. Congratulations readers; you have redeemed yourselves.</p> Guardian readers\xe2\x80\x99 predictions for the 2014-15 season <p>Who will win the Premier League?</p> <p>Chelsea 30%Arsenal 20%Liverpool 13%Manchester City 13%Manchester United 9%</p> <p>Which clubs will be relegated?</p> <p>Burnley 77%West Brom 48%Leicester 37%Aston Villa 33%QPR 23%</p> <p>Who will be the first manager sacked? </p> <p>Paul Lambert 25%Sam Allardyce 19%Alan Irvine 17%Alan Pardew 9%Garry Monk 8%</p> <p>Who will be the top goalscorer?</p> <p>Daniel Sturridge 25%Diego Costa 21%Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero 14%Wayne Rooney 11%Robin van Persie 10%</p> <p>Who will be the best signing of the summer?</p> <p>Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez 28%Cesc F\xc3\xa1bregas 16%Diego Costa 15%Dejan Lovren 9%Romelu Lukaku 6%</p> Guardian writers\xe2\x80\x99 predictions for the season <p>As ever, the writers\xe2\x80\x99 predictions were a bit hit and miss. The top four were predicted in the right order, Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s struggles were largely foreseen and Dominic Fifield anticipated that Eden Hazard would win the player of the season award. However, not all of our predictions came to pass \xe2\x80\x93 Aaron Ramsey and Robin van Persie were nowhere near the player of the season award, Willy Caballero did not become the signing of the summer and few of us could argue that Rolando Aarons developed into the young player of the season \xe2\x80\x93 so we can\xe2\x80\x99t be too smug.
