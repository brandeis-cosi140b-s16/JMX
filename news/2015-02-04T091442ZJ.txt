b'Jorge Mendes: only Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho could have replaced Sir Alex Ferguson'


b'<p>Jorge Mendes has cast doubt over Louis van Gaal being the best manager for Manchester United, with the agent claiming only the \xe2\x80\x9cgenius\xe2\x80\x9d Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho could have built on the successful 26-year tenure of Sir Alex Ferguson.</p> <p>Mendes, who represents Mourinho, also said he expects another client, David de Gea, to remain at United until at least the end of his contract in summer 2016.</p> <p>Mendes told the BBC that Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, can bring Manchester United further success after last season\xe2\x80\x99s barren campaign under Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s successor, David Moyes, but added: \xe2\x80\x9cAt the same time, he has just one problem \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s completely impossible to find someone like Sir Alex Ferguson because he\xe2\x80\x99s a god, he\xe2\x80\x99s a genius and to find a genius is very difficult.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou have one in England \xe2\x80\x93 Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho. Having Sir Alex Ferguson ensures at this moment you have 12 or 15 points more. He\xe2\x80\x99s finished his career, but he\xe2\x80\x99s someone that makes the difference.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Jorge Mendes: the most powerful man in football? </p>   <p>Mendes said, though, that Mourinho, who is in a second spell at Chelsea, will remain at the west London club in the long-term.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cJos\xc3\xa9 will stay for sure. He will be the Sir Alex Ferguson of Chelsea. He loves the supporters, he loves the city and I think he will stay there for more than 10 years.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of De Gea, who is yet to sign a contract extension, Mendes said: \xe2\x80\x9cHe has one year left on his contract and I think that he will stay in Manchester. The player will decide, but he\xe2\x80\x99s happy there, at the moment.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mendes also again stated that another of his players, Radamel Falcao, who is on loan at United from Monaco, may not sign permanently. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he will not stay in Manchester, he will play for sure in one of the biggest teams in Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p>'
