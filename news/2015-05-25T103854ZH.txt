b'Hern\xc3\xa1n Crespo on Istanbul 2005: \xe2\x80\x98Some team-mates were crying. I was in shock\xe2\x80\x99'


b'<p>\xe2\x80\x9cI could not believe it. It seemed impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d Hern\xc3\xa1n Crespo says with a sigh. Yet it all happened. Ataturk Stadium in Istanbul was the venue and 25 May, 2005 the date. Champions League history was rewritten as Liverpool went from 3-0 down to 3-3 in six madcap minutes against a Milan side packed with experienced players. Crespo, who is now working with Parma\xe2\x80\x99s youth teams and ready to launch his own managerial career, was one of those players. Ten years on and it still does not seem plausible.</p> <p>Hern\xc3\xa1n, you scored two goals in a Champions League final and yet it\xe2\x80\x99s remembered as a disaster, right?</p> <p>I think this is part of the beauty of football. That match is part of destiny, of things that can\xe2\x80\x99t be explained. Even today I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe it.</p> <p>It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the greatest of Liverpool sides, if you look at some names today. What did you think of that team before the game kicked off?</p> <p>Well, in fact, they only beat us on penalty kicks! In reality I knew a lot about that Liverpool side. Our coach [Carlo] Ancelotti told me two weeks before the final that I would start. So I started studying many of the Reds\xe2\x80\x99 matches. I basically knew everything. I could have easily prepared a report about Liverpool.</p> <p>The first half ended 3-0 to Milan. What were you thinking at half-time?</p> <p>For me to be in a Champions League final playing for Milan was already the best experience you can imagine. I grew up watching the great Milan teams with the Dutch players. I felt like I was living a dream: I was starting, I scored two goals and the other was scored by a legend such as Paolo Maldini. It was one of those nights where you can do everything easily, everything worked, every ball went where I wanted it to. It was a great feeling.</p> <p>How did you feel going into the changing rooms after scoring two goals in a Champions League final?</p> <p>My legs were shaking. I thought straight away about calming down, I told myself: \xe2\x80\x98Okay, we are still 0-0, nothing has happened yet\xe2\x80\x99. I was praying for everything to go well, just like when I won the Uefa Cup with Parma against Marseille. I told myself that anything could still happen. Yes, everything, but I certainly didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect something like what happened \xe2\x80\xa6</p> <p>And what about your team-mates? There were some reports that there were celebrations at half-time. What really happened?</p> <p>Nobody celebrated in the changing room, those stories are made up. In that Milan side we had players such as Alessandro Nesta, Maldini, Andrea Pirlo, Gennaro Gattuso, Clarence Seedorf, Andriy Shevchenko and many others: do you think they would celebrate after 45 minute? Quite the opposite, there were some who were discussing how we should have been playing better, despite the fact we were beating Liverpool 3-0.</p>     Hern\xc3\xa1n Crespo cannot hide his disappointment after losing the Champions League final against Liverpool on penalties.  Photograph: Luca Bruno/AP    <p>Everyone was calm, then. So what did Ancelotti say to the team at half-time?</p> <p>Carlo didn\xe2\x80\x99t give us specific instructions. He wanted us to calm down, he wanted to ensure we weren\xe2\x80\x99t satisfied. But I was so focused on the match, especially after scoring two goals, that I had my mind focused on controlling myself: I was focused on giving my best.</p> <p>Then those 6 minutes of hell, from 3-0 to 3-3. What do you remember of those moments on the pitch? Did the players say something to each other between the goals?</p> <p>We didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the time to do it, trust me. We were focused on our play until Rafa Ben\xc3\xadtez changed the match with a move: Didi Hamann came in front of the defence to free up Steven Gerrard. That switch put us in a very difficult situation. And then something that only destiny can control happened. Like the great goal headed goal by Steven, Vladimir Smicer with that great shot, and then the penalty that was first saved and then scored by Xabi Alonso. But the best was saved for the last I guess.</p> <p>You mean Jerzy Dudek?</p> <p>I will never forget Dudek\xe2\x80\x99s save from Shevchenko\xe2\x80\x99s effort, something incredible. I believe that Jerzy still to this day has no idea how he stopped that shot. How Shevchenko did not score that goal is surreal.</p> <p>So you did lose that game despite having led 3-0. How did you feel when you left the pitch?</p> <p>I was in shock. When Liverpool scored the last penalty I was about to go to the dressing room, but then I stopped and said to myself: \xe2\x80\x98No, it cannot be true that I am going to go and have a shower without having won the Champions League when we were 3-0 up. So I sat down behind the photographers. I had to see with my own eyes that Gerrard was actually going to lift the trophy. I still couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe it, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem real. Impossible. When Steven finally lifted it I thought: \xe2\x80\x98So it really happened\xe2\x80\x99. And then I went to the dressing room completely speechless.</p> <p>What was the atmosphere like in the dressing room?</p> <p>Simple: it was like a funeral. They were very difficult moments, nobody was able to speak even when we returned to the hotel. Some team-mates were crying, others were embracing their wives or kids. Trust me, it was a very difficult night.</p>     Hern\xc3\xa1n Crespo is working with Parma\xe2\x80\x99s youth teams at the moment.  Photograph: Marco Luzzani/Getty Images    <p>It went from being a dream to a nightmare for you. How do you feel about the game 10 years on?</p> <p>In some matches there is nothing we can do, unfortunately. Because aside from those six minutes we were basically the only team playing. But destiny wanted that Cup to go to Liverpool.</p> <p>Gerrard was able to kiss that Champions League trophy in Istanbul. On Sunday he played his last game for Liverpool. How did that make you feel?</p> <p>It was a shot to the heart. When a champion like Gerrard leaves a club like Liverpool something goes away inside you. I felt the way he said goodbye to Anfield with his kids was a beautiful moment, a piece of history that is sadly leaving. I feel proud to have faced Steven, both in that final and when I was at Chelsea. I thought back to all the times we battled hard on the pitch but always as honourable men, filled with passion and love for football.</p> <p>Now you coach one of Parma\xe2\x80\x99s youth team. When did you realise you wanted to become a manager?</p> <p>I like coaching a lot and I\xe2\x80\x99ve always had this desire in me. After I stopped playing I went to study with some of my previous managers, such Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho and Carlo Ancelotti, then \xe2\x80\x9cCholo\xe2\x80\x9d [Diego Simeone]. Parma had offered me to coach the first team when it looked like Roberto Donadoni was going to Lazio, then everything collapsed and I accepted the Primavera [senior youth team]. Starting with young players is the right thing and fascinating.</p> <p>Do you ever think about managing in the Premier League? Possibly at Chelsea? You played there and the club became a big part of you.</p> <p>It would be extraordinary. They always treated me well in England and at Chelsea I had so many successes as a player. For those who want to be a manager, the Premier League is the best place to work; at the very top.</p>'
