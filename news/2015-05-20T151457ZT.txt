b'LOUIS VAN GAAL\xe2\x80\x99S SAX APPEAL  <p>The Fiver has long been a real gone jazz fiend that digs a free-flowing and kickin\xe2\x80\x99 barrelhouse vibe [translation: the Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s entire jazz collection consists of one Miles Davis album, but for the purposes of celebrating Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s heroic performance at the Manchester United end-of-season beano last night, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to employ the literary conceit that we\xe2\x80\x99re much more into this genre of music than we actually are].</p> <p>Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s bebopping and swinging to John Coltrane, Kenny G or The Muppet Show\xe2\x80\x99s Zoot, few things make us feel more alive than watching a brass man lay down hot licks on his popsicle stick as they demonstrate their smokin\xe2\x80\x99 chops and it seems Van Gaal is a like-minded cat. Having finished speaking after presenting David de Gea with his supporters\xe2\x80\x99 Player of the Year gong at Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s annual awards evening, the Dutchman bounded back on stage, grabbed a microphone and announced he wanted to say something. \xe2\x80\x9cI have said to you \xe2\x80\x93 you are the best fans in the world but tonight I was a little disappointed and I shall say why,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared, prompting general mystification. \xe2\x80\x9cI have seen a lady who plays the saxophone fantastically. Give her big applause.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Quite who this hot-lipped lady horn-blower is, if indeed she exactly exists beyond the boundaries of Louis\xe2\x80\x99s imagination remains a mystery, but one thing\xe2\x80\x99s for certain \xe2\x80\x93 the Manchester United manager made a whole lot of new friends with his own quite frankly epic performance, delivering an at times incomprehensible but always entertaining oration that may or may not have been fuelled by a glass or two of Dutch courage. Or courage, as Dutch people like Louis might refer to it. Either way, the Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s having one if there\xe2\x80\x99s any left.</p> <p>Earlier, shortly after good-naturedly whacking Ryan Giggs across the back of the head for outbidding him in a charity auction, Louis had performed a stand-up routine in which he told all present that United are \xe2\x80\x9cvery close\xe2\x80\x9d to Chelsea, who lead them by 15 points in the Premier League table. \xe2\x80\x9cYou remember away game against Chelsea?\xe2\x80\x9d he said of last month\xe2\x80\x99s defeat at Stamford Bridge. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, no, you have to listen. I ask you to listen because at that time we have 50 points and then [Wayne] Rooney sat in the dressing room \xe2\x80\x93 we go for the second place, he said that. [Before that] six games in a row we win and then we go to Chelsea. Who are the better team then? It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to say that now in this room. I can believe it but it was the truth but we lost.\xe2\x80\x9d No, the Fiver isn\xe2\x80\x99t sure what he meant either but translated into sax solo, we reckon it probably went a little something like this. </p> <p>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT</p> <p>Join Paul Doyle from 7.15pm for MBM coverage of Arsenal 3-0 Sunderland.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAnyone who wants to write sh1t about me, and try to put me down, go ahead. This tiger will fight till the end\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Nicklas Bendtner. Grrrrrrrrrrrr.</p>     Tony the Tiger. Photograph: Josh Hedges/Zuffa LLC/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images     FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMay I be one of the 1,057 Bristol Rovers or Grimsby Town fans to write in to say how lucky Middlesbrough supporters are to have even a misspelt name on their Wembley ticket. My Vanarama Conference (do we really have to prefix Conference with that awful made-up word?) Promotion Final ticket had neither Rovers nor Town mentioned - so it is hardly worth keeping as a souvenir. Mind you, that result on Sunday caused me to finally understand what Wellington meant about Waterloo being \xe2\x80\x98the nearest run thing you ever saw\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Peter Munt (and no other Bristol Rovers or Grimsby Town fans).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFurther to Trevor Marshallsea\xe2\x80\x99s ideas for commemorating great relegation escapes [yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver], rather than a crossed-out gallows, maybe a crossed-out caricature of Nigel Quashie would be more apt? Or a blank space in the shape of \xe2\x80\x98Arry Redknapp to commemorate him legging it (dodgy knees and all) mid-season?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Derek McGee.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn response to Trevor\xe2\x80\x99s missive, I would suggest Leicester can put as many stars, moons, hearts, clovers or, indeed, \xe2\x80\x98tiny gallows with a Ghostbusters-style red slash through it\xe2\x80\x99 adjacent to their badge as they see fit. This season, whilst watching Ipswich, I was confused as to why their shirts were adorned with three stars. Discussing with my friends, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t think they\xe2\x80\x99d won three Big Cups, three league titles or three of any other cups for that matter. To our surprise, the internet informed us that the stars are for the First Division in 1962, the FA Cup in 1978 and Uefa Cup in 1981. Precedent set. Soon English clubs\xe2\x80\x99 shirts will resemble homework marked by an overly exuberant primary school teacher, so a few gallows sound perfectly reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Kris Milovsorov.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs a Carlisle fan I\xe2\x80\x99d like to back Trevor Marshallsea\xe2\x80\x99s alternative insignia idea. It would be wonderful to have a paintbrush and perhaps a shard of glass above our badge to forever remind us of our respective glories in the 2011 Johnstone\xe2\x80\x99s Paint Trophy and 1997 Autowindscreens Shield\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Calvin Jones.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs a Villa fan I initially thought Trevor Marshallsea\xe2\x80\x99s idea was a brilliant one, until I realised that with all our awards there would be no space left for the logo itself\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Phil West.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
