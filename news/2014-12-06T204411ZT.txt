b'Tearful Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero hurts knee and may miss Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Roma date'


b'<p>Manchester City made up ground in the Premier League with a workmanlike win over Everton but their chances of gaining a result in Rome in the Champions League on Wednesday were hit by a second-minute injury to the in-form Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero.</p> <p>The striker departed in tears after twisting a knee in an early challenge, and Manuel Pellegrini confirmed he fears ligament damage. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will know more tomorrow,\xe2\x80\x9d the City manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cAt this stage we have to say he will probably miss the next game in Rome, it is very difficult to recover from a ligament problem in three days. Of course it is a big problem for us because Sergio was in a very good moment, we will miss him in Rome, but he is not the only one. David Silva is not yet ready to come back, Stevan Jovetic has a hamstring problem that also needs checking out tomorrow, Edin Dzeko is not fully fit yet and if you include Vincent Kompany, we might have to play in Rome without five key players.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cConsidering we had so many missing I was pleased to beat a very good Everton team and get a bit nearer to Chelsea,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini continued. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter the Chelsea result at Newcastle the way we won today was important. We did it without our main attacking players but the defence did very well too. I am not going to complain about the number of injuries we have, we have a squad and I will not use injuries as an excuse. But clearly losing key players in December makes life harder. This is always a difficult month, and I am pleased we are still winning and still in touch with Chelsea.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe you don\xe2\x80\x99t win the title in December but if you are going for the title your results in December can be key.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez was unhappy at the penalty awarded by Andre Marriner to give City the victory, claiming Phil Jagielka\xe2\x80\x99s challenge on James Milner was nothing more than \xe2\x80\x9cshoulder to shoulder\xe2\x80\x9d and should never have been penalised. \xe2\x80\x9cMilner moves the ball on at the last moment and Phil cannot stop his run,\xe2\x80\x9d the Everton manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he supposed to do, disappear? I am really disappointed in the decision because a defender is allowed to challenge for the ball. You could tell by Milner\xe2\x80\x99s reaction that even he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think he had been fouled. He got straight up to carry on playing, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even looking for a penalty decision.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
