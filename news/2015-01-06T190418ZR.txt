b'Roy Hodgson praises Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s Harry Kane as England call-up beckons'


b'<p>Roy Hodgson has acclaimed Harry Kane\xe2\x80\x99s improvement at Tottenham Hotspur, describing him as having \xe2\x80\x9ccome on leap and bounds\xe2\x80\x9d as the manager considers whether to promote the 21-year-old to the full England squad for the first time.</p> <p>Kane has established himself more prominently in Hodgson\xe2\x80\x99s thinking after his impressive run of form for Mauricio Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s side, including two goals in the 5-3 defeat of Chelsea and a performance that gave John Terry and Gary Cahill more problems than at any other time this season.</p> <p>England\xe2\x80\x99s next game is not until 27 March when they play a qualifier against Lithuania, and Hodgson will have to balance his thinking by weighing up the fact that Gareth Southgate regards Kane as an important member of his squad for the European Under-21 Championship in June.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHarry is one of those players \xe2\x80\x93 Andros Townsend being another one \xe2\x80\x93 who didn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly burst on to the scene in his club side and get straight in,\xe2\x80\x9d Hodgson said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey got loaned out first and sent out to different places to learn their trade, if you like, or at least pick up some important aspects of their trade.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe have watched [Kane] for a while and I worked with him briefly in the Under-21s when I filled in for one game. Harry has come on in leaps and bounds and I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised because I know [the former coaches] Tim Sherwood and Les Ferdinand very well. They have worked with him at Tottenham and they always believed in him as a goalscorer. It\xe2\x80\x99s tremendous to see people like him doing so well and quite strange that in the Under-21s a year or two ago we were bemoaning the fact we didn\xe2\x80\x99t think our forwards were up to the level of the midfielders \xe2\x80\x93 and yet suddenly Kane, Saido Berahino and Danny Ings are all doing exceptionally well. It will be a headache for Gareth who he picks to play in the summer.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Hodgson, who reiterated his long-held view that there should be a mid-season break in the Premier League, also praised Charlie Austin due to the striker\xe2\x80\x99s scoring form for QPR. \xe2\x80\x9cCharlie is doing very well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said on SiriusXM FC. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s another one who has come through the lower leagues and, a bit like Rickie Lambert, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure people have watched Charlie many times and dismissed him because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t run like the wind. You can be a good footballer sometimes without needing to run like the wind and Harry Redknapp has brought the best out of him for QPR.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
