b'Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger buoyant after Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s convincing win over Manchester City'


b'       <p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger praised his Arsenal players for creating a \xe2\x80\x9cpositive platform\xe2\x80\x9d for the coming season with their 3-0 win against Manchester City in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s Community Shield and took particular heart from the team\xe2\x80\x99s success in beating a fellow contender for the Premier League title.</p> <p>Goals from Santi Cazorla, Aaron Ramsey and Olivier Giroud secured a thoroughly deserved victory for Arsenal, who after going nine years without a trophy now have two in 85 days, with this triumph following that over Hull in May\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup final. City were, in fairness, under-strength, with a host of first-team players, most notably Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero, Vincent Kompany, Fernandinho and Pablo Zabaleta, not considered for selection after only recently returning to the squad after being given an post-World Cup break.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the champions\xe2\x80\x99 starting lineup did include first-team regulars such as Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9, Edin Dzeko and Samir Nasri, as well as the summer signings Willy Caballero and Fernando, allowing Wenger to reflect on a job well done before Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League opener against Crystal Palace on Saturday.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cTo win today gives us a positive platform to prepare,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was important for our confidence to win the game and it was even more important to have a big part in the game. That is a comfort to me to see that we can produce the kind of quality we have produced for some long patches in the game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Arsenal failed to beat City in the league last season, losing 6-3 at the Etihad Stadium and drawing 1-1 at the Emirates Stadium. They also failed to beat Chelsea home or away and lost at Liverpool and Everton.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why it was important for us today not to lose the game,\xe2\x80\x9d Wenger added. \xe2\x80\x9cLast year we were very consistent against below-top-six teams and not consistent against top-six teams. The year before it was the reverse. I hope this year it will be right on both sides.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Wenger revealed that he had given Thomas Vermaelen permission to leave the club at the end of last season and praised the Belgian for behaving \xe2\x80\x9cwith dignity\xe2\x80\x9d prior to his \xc2\xa315m move to Barcelona. The Frenchman also confirmed that Mikel Arteta will be Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s full-time captain, with Per Mertesacker his understudy.</p> <p>For Manuel Pellegrini, the hope is that the bulk of his squad have the required match fitness when their defence of the Premier League title begins against Newcastle on Sunday. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be difficult to be ready,\xe2\x80\x9d said the City manager. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have seven players who have just worked five days and another five players who have worked eight or nine days, so we will see which of them are ready and which of them are not ready.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini again suggested that Joe Hart will face a battle to be a regular for City, having said last week that the club have \xe2\x80\x9ctwo No1 goalkeepers\xe2\x80\x9d after the \xc2\xa34.4m arrival of Caballero from M\xc3\xa1laga. The 32-year-old Argentinian made his City debut on Sunday and could not really be blamed for any of Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s three goals.</p> <p>Asked if Hart, who was dropped for a period last season and was an unused substitute here, will start for City at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park at the weekend, Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cAll the 22 players we have in our squad must demonstrate who is No1 in all the positions. Joe finished last season playing very well. We will see next Sunday which players start against Newcastle.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
