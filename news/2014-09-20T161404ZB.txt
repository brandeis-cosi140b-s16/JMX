b'Burnley 0-0 Sunderland | Premier League match report'


b'<p>At some point this season, Burnley and Sunderland will win a league game. But not just yet, and possibly not for a while. In the meantime, they conjured one of the most predictable scorelines of the season. Burnley cannot score and are increasingly solid defensively. Sunderland are the division\xe2\x80\x99s draw specialists.</p> <p>The points were duly shared, to neither delight nor dismay. Indeed, until the woodwork was rattled twice in the closing minutes, there was an air of inevitability about the stalemate.</p> <p>Even then, the drama was deceptive. Ashley Barnes\xe2\x80\x99s effort acquired an added menace courtesy of a deflection off Lee Cattermole, redirecting it on to the bar. The hosts\xe2\x80\x99 goalkeeper, Tom Heaton, then tipped an added-time thunderbolt from the Sunderland left-back Patrick van Aanholt on to the post.</p> <p>The Sunderland manager was nevertheless nonplussed. \xe2\x80\x9cI was expecting more than that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gus Poyet. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything we planned didn\xe2\x80\x99t really go as we would like. We played OK but okay is not enough in the Premier League. We need to play better than OK.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>So it was an outcome to satisfy statisticians, if few others. Burnley recorded a third successive clean sheet in the top flight for the first time since 1968. However, their goal drought, dating back to Scott Arfield\xe2\x80\x99s spectacular opener against Chelsea, now extends to 526 minutes. If they rarely looked like ending it, perhaps sympathy should be extended to the parched Clarets.</p> <p>While Liverpool are experiencing life without the sold Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez and the sidelined Daniel Sturridge, Burnley find themselves in a similar predicament. They, too, had two strikers who reached the 20-goal landmark last season. Now neither is available, with Sam Vokes recovering from cruciate ligament surgery and Danny Ings hamstrung. They were ill-timed injuries. Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s first two home games were against Chelsea and Manchester United and if this represented the first truly winnable match on home soil, Sean Dyche\xe2\x80\x99s side required a cutting edge. Instead, they had a blunt attack.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI am not naive,\xe2\x80\x9d Dyche said. \xe2\x80\x9cI know you have to score goals to win games but our performance levels are very good. We probably edged it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He took solace from Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s infectious commitment. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we keep playing like that I am absolutely convinced wins are around the corner,\xe2\x80\x9d Dyche said.</p> <p>Ings\xe2\x80\x99s replacement Marvin Sordell had an immediate opportunity to mark his first Premier League start by ensuring the absent forwards weren\xe2\x80\x99t missed. Sadly for him, he squandered it, scuffing his shot wide.</p> <p>His strike partner, Lukas Jutkiewicz, showed a Stakhanovite work ethic and Dyche felt his side merited a penalty when Emanuele Giaccherini challenged the former Middlesbrough man, but Burnley only truly threatened when Arfield, their sole scorer this season, almost caught Vito Mannone out at his near post and Barnes nearly scored in fortunate fashion. But Burnley ended as they started, playing at a high tempo.</p> <p>Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s performance was more fitful. There were glimpses of quality from Adam Johnson and Giaccherini, particularly when they combined and the Italian centred, aiming to give Connor Wickham a tap-in. The Burnley captain, Jason Shackell, made a goal-saving interception.</p> <p>Van Aanholt then struck the post but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to placate Poyet. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to control the game more, to be in better positions and create better chances,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a big opportunity to take three points and we missed it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Nor did the travelling fans depart satisfied. They spent much of the second half calling for Alan Pardew to remain Newcastle manager. They fell silent when news of their rivals\xe2\x80\x99 comeback at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park filtered throughand while Sunderland may be stable and Newcastle embroiled in crisis, they are separated by a point.</p>'
