b'Premier League: 10 things to look out for on the opening weekend'


b'1) The new dawn \xe2\x80\x93 same as the old dawn? <p>It will be a year and a day since Manchester United barrelled up to Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s Liberty Stadium, strode away with a 4-1 win and left behind a sense that not very much had changed at all. Subsequent events give little reason for mawkishness, decent man though David Moyes is, but there was little warning of what would pass when Robin van Persie and Danny Welbeck scored excellent braces in south Wales. Now, Louis van Gaal beds in against the same opponents that gave his predecessor such a deceptive start \xe2\x80\x93 although Old Trafford is the venue this time \xe2\x80\x93 and eyes will be peeled for the most minor of conceptual deviations that show the Dutchman\xe2\x80\x99s sleight of hand. For all that United\xe2\x80\x99s pre-season USA tour was not to Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s taste, pre-season results have been good \xe2\x80\x93 six wins from six if you count a shoot-out win over Inter, and even Marouane Fellaini silencing some distasteful jeers with a late winner against Valencia \xe2\x80\x93 and the club has been keen to promote a sense of momentum and freshness. In reality this will take time to sustain: United do not have the same preparation problems involving returning World Cup stars as several of their rivals, although that tells a tale in itself and Van Gaal is yet to delve into the transfer market to fill the more obvious gaps. He surely will, and for now he will be well aware that footballing success lies to a large extent between the ears. A confident opening might, this time, set United fair for better things.

Who to start up front against Crystal Palace, Yaya Sanogo, callow, gangly nuisance who sometimes looks like he is learning on the job, or Olivier Giroud, still not quite up to speed after his World Cup exertions but the scorer of a fine goal in Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s 3-0 win over Manchester City in the Community Shield? It was Sanogo who got the nod against City and while he fluffed a good chance to score his first goal for the club in the first half, the young French striker had a hand in Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s opener and set up Aaron Ramsey to score their second. Sanogo lacks finesse and can be unconvincing, often giving the impression that he is on the verge of miscontrolling a pass or tripping over himself, but he has made an impact in some games and there was glimpse of his potential when he scored four in the recently friendly against Benfica. Wenger has been supportive. Yet it is worrying that a player with so many rough edges is the alternative to Giroud, who also blows hot and cold. Another striker could help this Arsenal team make the jump from very good to great.

The context has changed now. The Belgian is no longer a loanee of limitless promise whose 15 goals last season gave rise to tantalising visions of Champions League football and \xe2\x80\x93 who knew? \xe2\x80\x93 the far-off dream of a permanent signing; he is now a fully-fledged Everton player and, at \xc2\xa328m, there will be pressure on him to respond accordingly. It is important to remember that Lukaku is still just 21 and is probably yet to develop the tools that will see him through the kind of adversity faced by every striker at some stage; an up-and-down World Cup showing suggested that such polyvalence is a little while from being evident. This is not to pre-empt failure, because Lukaku\xe2\x80\x99s two full seasons in the Premier League have been remarkable for a player of his years and at current rate of knots he will be peerless in a few years\xe2\x80\x99 time, but there will inevitably be questions asked if he does not hit the ground running and Everton will need to show some love to what comes across as a sensitive character during stickier spells. Promoted Leicester will not be obliging opponents but an early goal would go down well.

Photograph: Steve Bardens/Getty Images    <p>Probably not quite, but the pressure on Sam Allardyce to deliver \xe2\x80\x93 and in a certain way \xe2\x80\x93 this season is such that West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s early form will take on added significance. You can\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking that Allardyce, for all that he can be mockable, was hung out to dry by the board\xe2\x80\x99s promise that he is on message to provide \xe2\x80\x9cmore entertainment\xe2\x80\x9d, and if Tottenham Hotspur evince particular early cohesion under Mauricio Pochettino on Saturday then there may be more opportunity for stark stylistic comparisons. Allardyce has certainly added to the squad\xe2\x80\x99s technical level over the summer. Mauro Zarate is gifted if infuriating, Aaron Cresswell and Carl Jenkinson are upgrades at full-back, Diego Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s potential is highly thought of and Enner Valencia is one of the summer\xe2\x80\x99s most intriguing signings, but the latter is unlikely to be ready to start for a few more weeks and Andy Carroll \xe2\x80\x93 not a terrible foil for all this, on paper \xe2\x80\x93 has been struck down by injury once more. A shift in style is unlikely to be seamless, and fans will probably have to stomach the odd cross slung over for Carlton Cole in the interim whatever the extent of any change. How much slack will they, and the board, cut Allardyce?

Irvine is a popular and talented coach and fared well in charge of unfancied Preston in the Championship last decade, but is untested in a leading role at this level. The fact that he is essentially working under technical staff Terry Burton and Richard Garlick may well play to his strengths \xe2\x80\x93 which lie out on the training field \xe2\x80\x93 but also risks him becoming the fall guy for more of the systemic problems that dogged the club in 2013-14. Pre-season results have been poor, and Sunderland are buoyant visitors to The Hawthorns after last season\xe2\x80\x99s escape. After a summer of considerable player turnover that supplied a bargain in Joleon Lescott and a steeply-priced striker in Brown Ideye, Irvine will need his preparations to bear fruit quickly and West Brom may need a little more patience than those above him have recently been possessed to show.

Hoddle is likely to sit on the Loftus Road bench during QPR\xe2\x80\x99s own return to the top flight against Hull on Saturday, and if his impact alongside Redknapp is anything like that of another ex-England manager \xe2\x80\x93 current Derby incumbent Steve McClaren \xe2\x80\x93 this time last year then the appointment will have been a shrewd one. Perhaps the outlook is similarly bright for Hoddle\xe2\x80\x99s own job prospects: Redknapp will be 68 this season and seems unlikely to go on for too much longer; the 3-5-2 formation he has used in pre-season appears to have his new partner\xe2\x80\x99s name written on it. It is also a setup that should suit Rio Ferdinand\xe2\x80\x99s ageing legs, and Hoddle seems the ideal pair of hands to cultivate a style that should see plenty of moves start at the 35-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s feet. QPR have their work cut out if they are to re-establish themselves at the top table \xe2\x80\x93 and any sighting of Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my this Saturday may tell us a bit more about their chances \xe2\x80\x93 but, if they manage it, the germ of a succession plan appears to have sprouted.

Photograph: Paul Currie/Action Images    <p>Barcelona, Roma, Milan, Ajax, Stoke City: spot the odd one out. It has been an eclectic and often difficult few years for Bojan Krkic, the former Barcelona youth prodigy who is now hoping to resurrect his career under Mark Hughes. His arrival at the Britannia Stadium proves their desire to cultivate a more appealing style of play but without being disrespectful to Stoke, it also shows how far he has fallen. Bojan won 10 trophies at Barcelona, including three league titles and two Champions Leagues, and this was not how his career was expected to pan out when he emerged in 2007 and people were raving about another La Masia wonderkid. Now 23, he should be coming into his own at the highest level. Yet he was unable to make the most of his potential at Barcelona, despite occasional flashes of brilliance, and was underwhelming elsewhere. Stoke have made an exciting signing and Bojan, who still has time on his side, is obviously talented. It will be fascinating to see whether Hughes can inspire him.

While Adam Lallana\xe2\x80\x99s injury seems to have ensured that he dodges the bullet of this early, inevitable fixture against their former employers, his cohort will be raring to go and there are points to prove on both sides. Lovren played well and scored against Borussia Dortmund last weekend but there remain suspicions about just how structured Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 defensive recruitment has been; Lambert did not find the net in pre-season but his manager, when stressing that no pressure should be placed on him, seemed to imply that his will be more of a supporting role over the coming months. Southampton, for whom Lovren \xe2\x80\x93 of course \xe2\x80\x93 scored a winner at Anfield last September, could usefully strike a similar blow this time to dispel any ideas that they are a club on the slide. There is a script written here somewhere. If Liverpool win a late penalty in front of the Kop, perhaps boyhood fan Lambert may be thankful that he got a rare miss out of his system against Milan two weeks ago.

City are yet to field anything like their first-choice team this summer, which may have been good news for Dedryck Boyata and Scott Sinclair but means too that Manuel Pellegrini has been planning with something of a blindfold. Vincent Kompany, Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero, Pablo Zabaleta and Fernandinho are among those who will only have two weeks\xe2\x80\x99 training under their belts \xe2\x80\x93 and no match practice \xe2\x80\x93 by the time City travel to Newcastle, while the \xc2\xa332m deal for Eliaquim Mangala was only sealed on Monday. There is only so much that a four-match tour of the USA can do when half of your squad is missing, and Pellegrini will not be heartened by an early fixture list that sees Liverpool next up after the visit to St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park. City are not the only team to have been particularly hard-hit by late returns from the World Cup \xe2\x80\x93 Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s throng of Germans will not be seeing much action for a while either \xe2\x80\x93 but theirs is a higher perch to be knocked from and any early slip-ups would give encouragement to their rivals. Pellegrini needs to make sure they find a way to get the job done.

Photograph: Paul Burrows/Action Images    <p>Burnley know how to handle a baptism of fire. Five years ago, they beat reigning champions Manchester United 1-0 in their first Premier League home game at Turf Moor, Robbie Blake\xe2\x80\x99s winner living longer in the memory than much of what would follow in an ultimately doomed campaign. The impressive, intense Sean Dyche knows that consistency will more important than the occasional famous victory if a similar fate is to be averted this time, but it will be interesting to see what kind of marker his team can set down against a Chelsea team playing its first game of the post-Lampard and Cole era. They have an outstanding young striker in Danny Ings, a reborn winger in Michael Kightly and, in the gifted right-back Kieran Trippier, a player who may yet show Manchester City the folly of denying breathing space to homegrown talent. More than all that, they work diligently to clear instructions: their football in the Championship was structured, orderly and blissfully straightforward. That will not be all they require over the season, and Dyche knows they need further additions to a thin squad, but this is often a good time of year to catch the big guns cold and he will have faith in the tried and trusted on Monday night.
