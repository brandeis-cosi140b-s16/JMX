b'Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas and Chelsea seek killer instinct against Paris Saint-Germain'


b'<p>Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas has admitted Chelsea have lacked \xe2\x80\x9ca killer instinct\xe2\x80\x9d at times this season but is confident Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side will be ruthless enough in their approach to force passage beyond Paris Saint-Germain and into the Champions League quarter-finals.</p> <p>Chelsea go into Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s second leg with the tie delicately balanced at 1-1 after the first game at Parc des Princes, but with the hosts having already earned silverware this term through their success in the Capital One Cup earlier this month. That was the first trophy of Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s second spell in charge, and a watershed moment for what is in effect a developing side, with F\xc3\xa0bregas confident that success will have had a positive effect on the squad.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFrom my experience, and especially with the national team, when we unlocked mentally that fear of quarter-finals or getting on to a really big stage, that\xe2\x80\x99s when we felt we could become champions,\xe2\x80\x9d said F\xc3\xa0bregas, a World Cup and European Championship winner with Spain but a player for whom the League Cup win over Spurs had provided a first success in English football in a decade following Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup triumph in 2005. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd once we were champions we were unstoppable.</p>           Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho bullish ahead of Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Paris clash with PSG.    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what we have to do. We have to believe we are the best, be mentally dominant and ready to cope with every situation. There will be moments against Paris Saint-Germain when they will be on top. We don\xe2\x80\x99t expect it to be a walk in the park, so we have to be mentally and physically ready, stick together as a team when they are being dangerous, and go for them when we can. This is the thing: if I have to say what we\xe2\x80\x99re missing a bit this season it\xe2\x80\x99s that moment when, if we can kill, we have to kill. There have been moments where we\xe2\x80\x99ve not done that and allowed other teams to push and be dangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>That appeared to be a reference to the games against Manchester City, twice, and Manchester United earlier this season when narrow leads were surrendered and points shed as a result. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to be more determined, especially when we go forward,\xe2\x80\x9d added F\xc3\xa0bregas. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we get one goal, we have to go for the second and third. That\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing we can really improve. Hopefully we will have that killer instinct tomorrow and go for the game from the first second. We know PSG are a great team. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean they scare us. We will push to win it from the start. We won\xe2\x80\x99t sit back, holding for a draw and seeing what happens. We\xe2\x80\x99ll look to win it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
