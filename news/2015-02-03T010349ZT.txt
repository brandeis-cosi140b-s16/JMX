b'Transfer deadline day: all the January ins and outs in the Premier League'


b'Arsenal <p>Ins Gabriel Paulista (Villarreal, \xc2\xa311.3m), Krystian Bielik (Legia Warsaw, \xc2\xa32m)</p> <p>Outs Lukas Podolski (Internazionale, loan), Joel Campbell (Villarreal, loan), Yaya Sanogo (Crystal Palace, loan)</p> <p> </p> <p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger put right the principal wrong from last summer with the capture of central defensive cover in the shape of Gabriel Paulista and although he did not sign the top-level defensive midfielder he might have wanted, he did add one for the future in Krystian Bielik, the 17-year-old Pole joining from Legia Warsaw despite competition from several Bundesliga clubs. DH</p> Aston Villa <p>Ins Carles Gil (Valencia, \xc2\xa33.2m), Scott Sinclair (Manchester City, loan)</p> <p>Outs Darren Bent (Derby County, loan), Gary Gardner (Nottingham Forest, loan), Chris Herd (Wigan, loan), Jordan Graham (Wolves, undisc), Daniel Johnson (Preston, undisc)</p> <p>Not exactly inspiring. Carles Gil has added some much needed craft and creativity in midfield but no one knows what to expect from the winger Scott Sinclair, who promised much at Swansea and delivered little at Manchester City. Rickie Lambert would have added some much-needed firepower but the Liverpool striker knocked Villa back. SJ</p> Burnley <p>Ins Michael Keane (Man Utd, \xc2\xa32m)</p> <p>Outs None</p> <p>Sean Dyche\xe2\x80\x99s aim was to retain Danny Ings at all costs and secure more Premier League experience. A mixed bag ensued. Ings remains at Turf Moor but with the manager admitting the striker\xe2\x80\x99s head has been turned by interest from Real Sociedad and Liverpool, who he is expected to join in the summer. Moves for the Dundee United midfielder Stuart Armstrong and Graham Dorrans of West Brom did not materialise. AH</p> Chelsea     Andre Schurrle left Chelsea for Wolfsburg. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian    <p>Ins Juan Cuadrado (Fiorentina, \xc2\xa326.8m)</p> <p>Outs Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle (Wolfsburg, \xc2\xa324m), Mohamed Salah (Fiorentina, loan), Mark Schwarzer (Leicester, free), Fernando Torres (Milan, free), Todd Kane (Nottm Forest, loan), Tomas Kalas (Middlesbrough, loan), Lewis Baker (Sheffield Wednesday, loan), Marko Marin (Anderlecht, loan), Nathaniel Chalobah (Reading, loan), John Swift (Swindon, loan); Stipe Perica (Udinese, loan), Ryan Bertrand (Southampton, undisc) </p> <p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho had hoped for a quiet window, the usual flurry of out-going loans aside, but the dissatisfaction of Sch\xc3\xbcrrle and Salah at bit-part roles forced his hand. At least Cuadrado would appear to be a very Mourinho-style replacement who should add to the team\xe2\x80\x99s firepower. DF</p> Crystal Palace <p>Ins Yaya Sanogo (Arsenal, loan), Pape Souar\xc3\xa9 (Lille, \xc2\xa33.45m), Jordon Mutch (QPR, \xc2\xa34.75m), Shola Ameobi (free agent), Andreas Breimyr (Bryne, undisc), Wilfried Zaha (Manchester United, \xc2\xa33m); Keshi Anderson (Barton Rovers, undisc); Lee Chung-yong (Bolton, \xc2\xa3750,000)</p> <p>Outs Stuart O\xe2\x80\x99Keefe (Cardiff, undisc), Jack Hunt and Zeki Fryers (both Rotherham, loan), Andrew Johnson (released), Jimmy K\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa9 (released), Alex Wynter (Colchester, undisc), Peter Ramage (Barnsley, loan), Jake Gray (Cheltenham, loan), Lewis Price (Crawley, loan), Andreas Breimyr (Bryne, loan), Barry Bannan (Bolton, loan)</p> <p>Alan Pardew and the Palace board will be satisfied with their month\xe2\x80\x99s work having added extensively to their first-team options.They have secured a natural left-back, two reinforcements up front, two versatile attacking midfielders and, in Zaha, a club favourite. with the hierarchy duly content with their manoeuvres in the market.DF</p> Everton    <p>Welcome to Everton, @Aaron7Lennon! #COYB #EFC pic.twitter.com/vPOiljgEDW</p>&mdash; Everton (@Everton) February 2, 2015    <p>Ins Aaron Lennon (Tottenham, loan)</p> <p>Outs Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o (Sampdoria, undisc), Mason Springthorpe (Fleetwood Town, free), John Lundstram (Leyton Orient, loan) Conor Grant (Motherwell, loan), Conor McAleny (Cardiff City, loan), Matthew Kennedy (Cardiff City, undisc) Hallam Hope (Bury, undisc)</p> <p>Roberto Martinez had insisted the January window was not the place \xe2\x80\x9cto find solutions\xe2\x80\x9d for Everton\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful season (he didn\xe2\x80\x99t say the dreadful part, but it has been) yet one presented itself late on in the form of Aaron Lennon. The Everton manager prioritised a creative spark above a striking replacement for Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o and eventually landed one. AH</p> Hull City <p>Ins Dame N\xe2\x80\x99Doye (Lokomotiv Moscow, undisc)</p> <p>Outs Tom Ince (Derby County, loan)</p> <p>Steve Bruce spent Monday in Paris attempting to persuade Dame N\xe2\x80\x99Doye, the Lokomotiv Moscow forward, to join Hull. An unusually quiet window for Bruce has also seen Aaron Lennon body-swerve a loan move from Tottenham to the KC Stadium. If relegation is to be avoided Hull\xe2\x80\x99s manager needs to start getting the best out of Tom Huddlestone and others in his underachieving squad. LT</p> Leicester City <p>Ins Mark Schwarzer (Chelsea, free), Andrej Kramaric (HNK Rijeka, \xc2\xa39m), Robert Huth (Stoke, loan)</p> <p>Outs Jack Barmby (Rotherham, loan), Tom Hopper (Scunthorpe, loan), Callum Elder (Mansfield Town, loan), Adam Dawson (Bristol Rovers, loan)</p> <p>Landing Andrej Kramaric, the highly rated 23-year-old Croatia striker, represented a coup for Leicester, while Robert Huth will bring some experience to central defence. The Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s bottom club were frustrated in their pursuit of the Mainz striker Shinji Okazaki and also missed out on signing Aaron Lennon from Spurs. SJ</p> Liverpool     Danny Ings remained with Burnley despite interest from Liverpool. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images    <p>Ins None</p> <p>Outs Suso (Milan, undisc), Lloyd Jones (Cheltenham, loan), Sheyi Ojo (Wigan, loan)</p> <p>An upturn in form and results reduced Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 desire for a new first-choice goalkeeper and another striker, although Liverpool did offer Lille a premium to have Divock Origi now rather than for \xc2\xa39.8m in the summer. Lille stood firm, so too Burnley over Danny Ings, although the latter may arrive at Anfield in the close season. AH</p> Manchester City <p>Ins Wilfried Bony (Swansea City, \xc2\xa325m) Bruno Zuculini (Valencia, returns to City after loan period)</p> <p>Outs Matija Nastasic (Schalke, loan), Scott Sinclair (Aston Villa, loan), Devante Cole (MK Dons, loan), George Evans (Scunthorpe Utd, loan), Divine Naah (NAC Breda, loan), Sinan Bytyqi (SC Cambuur, loan)</p> <p>Manuel Pellegrini can be happy at adding Bony, about the best striker the manager could have landed in the January window. However, given the problems at left-back, centre-back, and in defensive midfield, whether the manager has strengthened sufficiently to defend the title and eliminate Barcelona in next round of the Champions League is still to be proved. JJ</p> Manchester United     Wilfried Zaha\xe2\x80\x99s move to Manchester United proved an unsuccessful one. Photograph: Duane Burleson/Getty Images    <p>Ins Sadiq El Fitouri (undisc, Salford City), V\xc3\xadctor Vald\xc3\xa9s (free agent), Andy Kellett (Bolton, loan)</p> <p>Outs Wilfried Zaha (Crystal Palace, \xc2\xa33m), Anderson (Internacional), Ben Amos (Bolton, loan), Ben Pearson (Barnsley, loan), Joe Rothwell (Blackpool, loan), Will Keane (Sheff Weds, loan), Marnick Vermijl (Sheff Weds, undisc), Sam Johnstone (Preston, loan), Saidy Janko (Bolton, loan)</p> <p>The free transfer signing of Vald\xc3\xa9s \xe2\x80\x93 who had been training with the club \xe2\x80\x93 apart, Louis van Gaal had hoped to make at least one major signing, with Borussia Dortmund\xe2\x80\x99s Mats Hummels the favourite. He was unable to tempt the central defender so the winter window was comprised of outgoings mainly. Wilfried Zaha was sold and a flurry of players went out on loan. JJ</p> Newcastle United <p>Ins None</p> <p>Outs Davide Santon (Internazionale, loan), Gael Bigirimana, Kevin Mbabu, Shane Ferguson, Remi Streete, Haris Vuckic (all to Rangers, on loan)</p> <p>John Carver arguably needed an extra striker as well as a centre-half to replace the long-term injured Steven Taylor. He could also have done without losing the versatile Davide Santon to Internazionale on loan but at least the manager has avoided the worst-case scenario. The good news is Moussa Sissoko remains on Tyneside \xe2\x80\x93 and a top-10 finish should still be within Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s grasp. Meanwhile, five reserve players have gone on loan to Rangers, where Mike Ashley holds 8.92% of the shares. LT</p> Queens Park Rangers <p>Ins Mauro Z\xc3\xa1rate (West Ham, loan), Ryan Manning (Galway United, free)</p> <p>Outs Jordon Mutch (Crystal Palace, \xc2\xa34.75m), Josh Laurent (Brentford, undisclosed)</p> <p>Money has been tight at Loftus Road, a legacy of their previous spell in the topflight, though the lack of business into QPR may leave Harry Redknapp anxious. Their window even ended in farce with the Premier League blocking an attempt to send the unfit Mauro Z\xc3\xa1rate back to West Ham with Matt Jarvis moving the other way. That confusion rather summed it up. DF</p> Southampton <p>Ins Eljero Elia (Werder Bremen, loan), Filip Djuricic (Benfica, loan), Ryan Bertrand (Chelsea, undisc)</p> <p>Outs Jack Cork (Swansea, \xc2\xa33m), Jos Hooiveld (Millwall, loan), Artur Boruc (Bournemouth, loan) </p> <p>The bulk of Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s transfer dealings, incoming and outgoing, were conducted last summer. Ronald Koeman was reluctant to risk disrupting his squad mid-season following a fine first half to the campaign. Cork was out of contract in the summer and the 25-year-old utility player\xe2\x80\x99s move to Swansea was agreeable to all parties. Serbia\xe2\x80\x99s Filip Djuricic, an attacking midfielder, joined on Monday on loan for the rest of the season. DF</p> Stoke City <p>Ins Philipp Wollscheid (Bayer Leverkusen, loan)</p> <p>Outs Tomi Adeloye (Macclesfield, loan), Robert Huth (Leicester City, loan), Ryan Shotton (Derby City, undisc), George Waring (Barnsley, loan), Maurice Edu (undisc, Philadelphia Union)</p> <p>Mark Hughes had a modest amount in the kitty \xe2\x80\x93 around \xc2\xa310m \xe2\x80\x93 to spend with the manager cursing his luck at Bojan Krkic\xe2\x80\x99s long-term knee injury, suffered last week, and he was working hard on securing at least a short-term replacement for the Spaniard, who had such a good first half of the season. Before deadline day Philipp Wollscheid was the only new arrival, adding cover in defence. JJ</p> Sunderland     Jermain Defoe\xe2\x80\x99s move to Sunderland saw Jozy Altidore leave the club. Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images    <p>Ins Jermain Defoe (Toronto, undisc)</p> <p>Outs Jozy Altidore (Toronto, undisc), Charis Mavrias (Panathinaikos, loan), Cabral (released)</p> <p>Gus Poyet would ideally have liked a defensive reinforcement or two but swapping Jozy Altidore for Jermain Defoe represents an attacking upgrade. It is now up to the manager to get the best out of his squad. He also needs to work out a system that offers the gifted Emmanuele Giaccherini and Ricardo Alvarez much more first-team involvement. LT</p> Swansea City <p>Ins N\xc3\xa9lson Oliveira (Benfica, loan), Matt Grimes (Exeter, \xc2\xa31.75m), Kyle Naughton (Spurs, \xc2\xa35m), Jack Cork (Southampton, \xc2\xa33m)</p> <p>Outs Wilfried Bony (Manchester City, \xc2\xa325m), Ryan Hedges (Leyton Orient, loan), Rory Donnelly (Tranmere Rovers, loan)</p> <p>There is no escaping the fact Wilfried Bony\xe2\x80\x99s departure leaves a huge void at the Liberty Stadium. Swansea have got a decent price for the striker and can take their time to find a recruitment. They have also kept hold of Baf\xc3\xa9timbi Gomis and signed some exciting talent. SJ</p> Tottenham Hotspur    <p>We are delighted to announce that we have reached agreement with MK Dons for the signing of Dele Alli. #DeadlineDay pic.twitter.com/WqYjlBi0wX</p>&mdash; Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) February 2, 2015    <p>Ins DeAndre Yedlin (Seattle Sounders, undisc), Delle Ali (MK Dons, undisc)</p> <p>Outs Kyle Naughton (Swansea, \xc2\xa35m), Jordan Archer (Millwall, loan), Emmanuel Sonupe (St Mirren, loan), Beno\xc3\xaet Assou-Ekotto (contract cancelled), Aaron Lennon (Everton, loan), Delle Ali (MK Dons, loan back)</p> <p>Tottenham can normally be relied on to be eager transfer window players but this time they remained on the fringes, merely looking to add high-calibre youngsters and trim the fat from the squad. There was plenty of noise around several players at the end. It is clear who is surplus under Mauricio Pochettino. DH</p> West Bromwich Albion <p>Ins Callum McManaman (Wigan, \xc2\xa34.5m)</p> <p>Outs Luke Daniels (Scunthorpe, undisc), Bradley Garmston (Gillingham, loan)</p> <p>It went right to the wire for WBA and ended in disappointment. After signing Callum McManaman from Wigan, Tony Pulis made only one more addition to his squad: Darren Fletcher from Manchester United. Deals for Martin Olsson and Carlton Cole fell through, leaving Pulis without the left-back and target man he wanted. SJ</p> West Ham United     Ricardo Vaz T\xc3\xaa scored the goal in the 2012 Championship play-off final which took West Ham back to the Premier League. Photograph: Andrew Boyers/Action Images    <p>Ins None</p> <p>Outs Ricardo Vaz T\xc3\xaa (Akhisar Belediyespor, free)</p> <p>Sam Allardyce has said that West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s business in last summer\xe2\x80\x99s window represented the most successful recruitment drive during his time as a manager and the club was always likely to be quieter this time.
