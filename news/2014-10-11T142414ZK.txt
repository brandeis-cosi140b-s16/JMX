b'Karen Carney and Birmingham relaxed before WSL title climax'


b'<p>Karen Carney remembers the old times fondly but also knows things had to change. In 2006-07, her first season at Arsenal Ladies, Vic Akers\xe2\x80\x99 record-breaking team won the Premier League by 14 points. Played 22, won 22. They would take the quadruple that season, a feat that included Uefa Cup honours. On the continent at least, they had been run close.</p> <p>Now Carney, who has been capped 99 times by England and seems to have been around for longer than her 27 years, is preparing for a season climax that underlines the changes in women\xe2\x80\x99s football. Her Birmingham City side sit second in the Super League, two points behind Chelsea with a game to play. If Birmingham, who host Notts County on Sunday, win and Chelsea slip up at Manchester City, they stand to win their first title. That honour will fall to Chelsea if they take three points, but champions Liverpool can steal in if they beat Bristol Academy by a couple and the top two lose. In this mutable order, Arsenal are nowhere to be seen.</p> <p>Any league would beg for a final day with three realistic winners and Carney accepts things have come a long way. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is definitely more competitive,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cArsenal assembled the best players in the league and deserve credit for that but now everyone is spread out very evenly. These days you notice that when teams don\xe2\x80\x99t show up they get beaten. You have to be on it all the time, which I don\xe2\x80\x99t think was the case in the past. At Arsenal, if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on my game then I knew Kelly Smith could win it for us, or Lianne Sanderson, players like that. You can\xe2\x80\x99t think like that now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ten points separate first from seventh in an eight-team league (Everton, once the country\xe2\x80\x99s second power, have four and are long since relegated \xe2\x80\x93 further evidence of the new dynamic). It is comfortably the tightest-packed competition since the WSL began in 2011, and long before to boot. There has been controversy: Doncaster Rovers Belles were eased into the new second tier, seemingly to accommodate Manchester City, while Notts County are what became of a hitherto competitive Lincoln side. With these moves has come a professionalism that some argue is, however it was born, long overdue. Carney explains that Birmingham, runners-up in 2011 and 2012, are competing without the resources available to many of their rivals.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s really difficult for us,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the only player with a central England contract and the rest of the girls work. We train from 8 to 10 at night, two or three times a week, because that\xe2\x80\x99s when people can get in. With the resources we have we\xe2\x80\x99ve done brilliantly this year. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have all the fancy training pitches and the things other clubs have, but part of me loves that because I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can be spoonfed in life. When it comes down to it we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a pitch to play on this Sunday and that\xe2\x80\x99s what counts.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe club is looking to develop and push on, though, so these are exciting times. I sometimes look around and think: \xe2\x80\x98If we had just a little bit more, how good could we be?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Carney\xe2\x80\x99s double at Manchester City last Sunday was one in the eye for the newcomers but, more importantly, allowed the title race its luxurious finale. Her second, the winner, came with four minutes to play. The winger captains the side for whom she made her debut in her first spell at 14 (\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve done a lot of things well but there is a lot I\xe2\x80\x99d have done differently,\xe2\x80\x9d she says of wearing the armband), and is keen that her experience should be a relaxant for her team-mates on Sunday.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of youngsters in the squad and we just want them to enjoy themselves, express themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no pressure on us and there never has been. All the pressure is on Chelsea because it is effectively theirs to lose \xe2\x80\x93 they have one hand on the trophy. Manchester City won\xe2\x80\x99t be pushovers for them, we saw that last week. Whatever happens, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be disappointing for us because we know we\xe2\x80\x99ve given everything.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
