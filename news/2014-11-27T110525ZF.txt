b'Football transfer rumours: Fabian Sch\xc3\xa4r to Arsenal?'


b'<p>Somehow, somewhere, the Mill has learned that Arsenal may be in need of, among other things, a new centre-back. Despite regularly shipping six goals in games against their top-four rivals last season, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger spent the summer watching Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker getting knackered at the World Cup and then decided that the best course of action was to sell their bench-warming/injured deputy/captain Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona for \xc2\xa315m  so he could get the feel of the Camp Nou\xe2\x80\x99s more expensively upholstered dugout.</p> <p>Then with a seemingly endless 23 days to sign a replacement, the ever-frugal Frenchman decided that, no \xe2\x80\x93 bringing in 19-year-old right-back Calum Chambers would do quite nicely thank you, don\xe2\x80\x99t question my authority on this one, we have mental strength and great quality, and have you heard this all before over the last 18 years?</p> <p>Wenger had made polite inquiries to Aston Villa over Ron Vlaar and Athletic Bilbao over their young French defender Aymeric Laporte. However, it seems that Manchester United have stolen a march on the Gunners over both those players, and Wenger will instead turn his January attentions to Basel\xe2\x80\x99s Fabian Sch\xc3\xa4r.</p> <p>The 22-year-old Swiss defender will be heading to Anfield in a fortnight\xe2\x80\x99s time to try to ensure his side progress to the Champions League last 16 at Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s expense, but has made it clear he won\xe2\x80\x99t be signing a new deal at St Jakob Park and will leave next summer for nothing.</p> <p>Juventus have made moves to ensure Sch\xc3\xa4r will be heading to Turin come June, but Arsenal are ready to gazump the Italians with a \xc2\xa310m offer to take him in January and thus end the prospect of taking on Real Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s forward line in the Champions League last 16 with Nacho Monreal in central defence.</p> <p>As witnessed at the Emirates on Saturday, Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s defensive need is on a par with Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s and he is thought to have secured a deal for his fellow Dutchman Vlaar to make an Old Trafford switch in January.</p> <p>Van Gaal also wants to sign the 20-year-old Laporte, and with Bilbao having slipped out of the Champions League this week, the Basque club are ready to talk to Ed Woodward about the possibility of him parting with \xc2\xa330m early in 2015.</p> <p>Another Dutch defender on the move in January could be Ajax\xe2\x80\x99s Ricardo van Rhijn, with Spurs keen on the right-back as they look for reinforcements for the soon-to-be-but-never-quite-returning Kyle Walker.</p> <p>Mauricio Pochettino is also looking for new names at the other end of the pitch, and despite the goal-a-game ratio of Harry Kane is keen on Internazionale\xe2\x80\x99s Mauro Icardi, with the added bonus that the 21-year-old Argentinian will actually understand what the Spurs manager is saying, unlike Emmanuel Adebayor.</p> <p>Liverpool, however, are also interested and the price could be elevated beyond Spurs\xe2\x80\x99 reach, although Brendan Rodgers likes the look of Porto\xe2\x80\x99s Jackson Mart\xc3\xadnez.</p>'
