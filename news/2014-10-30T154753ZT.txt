b'ANOTHER OUTING FOR \xe2\x80\x98CITY SLIPPERS\xe2\x80\x99 <p>When the full-time whistle blew at the Etihad last night, Manuel Pellegrini began his search for answers. How had the team that appeared a force of nature just a couple of weeks ago morphed into the insipid side that had drawn with CSKA Moscow and been beaten \xe2\x80\x93 well beaten \xe2\x80\x93 by West Ham and now Newcastle? How to explain this sudden deterioration? How to put in into words? Soon enough he had it, a flash of inspiration, a glowing white-hot shard of truth. Tape recorders whirred, pencils poised over pages. \xe2\x80\x9cMy feeling,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cis that we are not playing well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>To which the obvious response involves bears, woods, popes and pointy hats. And while the Fiver looking for cheap laughs by highlighting someone else\xe2\x80\x99s statement of the bleedin\xe2\x80\x99 obvious is a little like a humbug that\xe2\x80\x99s been dropped on the floor of the car taking the mickey out of a badger for being black and white and covered in fur, the fact of the matter is that Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s feeling is absolutely right \xe2\x80\x93 City are really not playing well. Indeed, though it hardly made scintillating copy for the assembled hacks, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to argue with any of the Chilean\xe2\x80\x99s post-match assessments: \xe2\x80\x9cThe team ran a lot\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9cWe must find a solution and address it\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9cWe are in a difficult moment\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t win the three games we played this week\xe2\x80\x9d, and \xe2\x80\x9cWe are conceding too easy goals and we are not scoring the chances we have\xe2\x80\x9d. These all featured on Wednesday, every one of them an object lesson in cheek-clawing tedium, and every one of them on the button.</p> <p>While Pellegrini fretted about the lack of confidence in his side and contemplated the barren featureless wasteland of a future that is life for a Big Cup team denied the glitz and glamour of the Worthington Cup, Alan Pardew was (surprise, surprise) doing the sort of chest-beating last seen in Planet of the Apes. \xe2\x80\x9cI do know what I\xe2\x80\x99m doing,\xe2\x80\x9d he roared, hands hovering between the blue wire and the red wire as sweat beaded on the foreheads of those around him. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had a gameplan. The players needed to execute it but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t ask for more than they gave me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>So Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s Newcastle head off to host Liverpool at the weekend with a spring in their step and a song in their hearts, while Pellegrini and co trudge towards Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s meeting with Manchester United with an uncertainty not seen at the club since a certain bescarfed Italian was roaming the touchline. The good news for City of course is that, as everyone knows, no football derby in the history of the game has ever been remotely affected by the respective form of the two sides involved.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI feel outraged, my privacy and that of my family have been violated \xe2\x80\xa6 I have asked my lawyers in Costa Rica to take the necessary legal action\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Real Madrid keeper Keylor Navas responds to allegations that 24 government agents spied on him in his homeland.</p> INTO THE FOREST <p>26 May: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is fantastic for me\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Tom Ince holds talks in Milan over a move to Internazionale.</p> <p>6 June: \xe2\x80\x9cI have decided that my immediate future in the game lies in the Premier League\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ince \xe2\x80\x98turns down\xe2\x80\x99 Inter.</p> <p>30 October: Nottingham Forest sign Ince on loan from Hull City.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel.

Whether it is wise to take any kind of help from a fellow long-suffering Fiver reader is a matter of debate. In my professional opinion I can only advise that it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be. Although, as previously stated, my professional advice is undermined by my Fiver reading, etc and so on\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Matthew Taylor.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cJust seconds after I had read Magnus Ormaasen\xe2\x80\x99s Soulmates-based lament in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s super soaraway Fiver my sociable, erudite and friendly wife happened to glance over my shoulder and ask what I thought I was doing visiting shady dating sites. I know the Fiver has been complaining that it is too big for its format, but going all \xe2\x80\x98meta\xe2\x80\x99 on its readers isn\xe2\x80\x99t the answer\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Tom Herbert.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNot for the first time the sign-off at the end of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver links to sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats.

I will embrace any sanction that the FA impose, no matter what.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> RECOMMENDED VIEWING <p>In this week\xe2\x80\x99s edition of the Guardian Football Show, Nat Coombs visits Newcastle fans on Tyneside to ask: is there any case for the defence of Mike Ashley?
