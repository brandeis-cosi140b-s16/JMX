b'Monaco v Arsenal: Champions League \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0as it happened | Jacob Steinberg'


b'<p>Okay, so who had 2-0 to Arsenal? Everyone? All of you? Oh. They\xe2\x80\x99ve done it again. What a team. Arsenal were extremely good tonight, but they are out of the Champions League on away goals. For the fifth successive year, they leave the competition in the last 16 and they have been made to pay for their slackness in the first leg. You just can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to be this careless at this level. But well done to Monaco, who pounced in the first leg and then knuckled down to see it through. \xe2\x80\x9cPrescient little bugger, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d says Bill Jones. I leave you with my tweet after the first leg.</p>    <p>&quot;And although it&#39;s not enough to win the tie, at least Arsenal have salvaged some pride after this 2-0 win away in Monaco...&quot;</p>&mdash; Jacob Steinberg (@JacobSteinberg) February 25, 2015  '
