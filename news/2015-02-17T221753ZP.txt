b'PSG 1-1 Chelsea: five talking points from Parc des Princes | Dominic Fifield'


b'1) PSG were right to promise there would be no repeat <p>Paris Saint-Germain\xe2\x80\x99s rather provocative official Twitter feed had been trumpeting this would be \xe2\x80\x9ca different story\xe2\x80\x9d throughout the build-up and they were spot on. This time there was to be no barnstorming home win to illuminate the tie and no two-goal advantage to carry to London. Instead they rather belatedly raised their game when confronted by a very different beast: a Chelsea side reinforced down their entire spine, at centre-half aside, and better schooled in the Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho way. Admittedly the hosts were shorn of the injured Thiago Motta and Lucas Moura but they did not really prosper until after the interval. The tie may be tense but a score draw favours Chelsea. Now PSG must make good their social media department\xe2\x80\x99s pledge that \xe2\x80\x9crevenge is a dish best served... one year later\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> 2) Diego Costa is back and, indeed, an unchanged man <p>The manager had warned the \xc2\xa332m forward might have been blunted by his recent domestic three-match suspension, a ban which had sidelined Diego Costa since 27 January. In front of goal Mourinho was duly proved correct. There was barely a glimpse here from which the striker might prosper as he sought a first European reward in seven matches stretching back to Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Stamford Bridge back in April. But Chelsea were still bolstered by his aggressive presence as their forward focal point. He had buffeted Thiago Silva and left Zlatan Ibrahimovic limping before the midway point of the first half, and was pushing David Luiz away before the end, all confirmation his style will not be changed. The hope is the bite will have returned for the second leg when he will have more game-time in his legs.</p> 3) Matic shows predecessor exactly how it is done <p>Nowhere was the upgrade in Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s line-up since last year\xe2\x80\x99s quarter-final felt more keenly than in defensive midfield. David Luiz remains that lovable bundle of frizzy entertainment, his antics here including blatantly rubbing out the referee\xe2\x80\x99s vanishing spray for a free-kick and smearing it a yard to the left, but, thrust into defensive midfield for the first time as a PSG player, there were familiar frailties too, not least when he lost Branislav Ivanovic for the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 first-half goal. David Luiz is a centre-half by choice but had played in midfield for the London club last year with his replacement in the line-up, Nemanja Matic, providing the steady influence, consistency in the decision and strength at the base of Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s midfield that sides so crave. The Serb had been cup-tied a year ago. He is utterly integral now.</p> 4) Chelsea boast two of the best in Courtois and Cech <p>Thibaut Courtois needed an authoritative performance here. The young Belgian had been rested in Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s previous game, a tight contest with Everton, after an uncharacteristically shaky offering at Villa Park and Petr Cech\xe2\x80\x99s excellence in his stead had provided a reminder that, as Mourinho has regularly stated, \xe2\x80\x9cwe possess two of the best goalkeepers in the world\xe2\x80\x9d. Yet Courtois is perceived as his manager\xe2\x80\x99s first-choice, his absence prompting raised eyebrows. So there was relief to be had when he dived to block Blaise Matuidi\xe2\x80\x99s early header, when he turned aside Edinson Cavani\xe2\x80\x99s near-post flick and, most dramatically, when he pushed away Ibrahimovic\xe2\x80\x99s header in stoppage time. That was a timely moment for the goalkeeper to demonstrate his class.</p> <p>5In Ibrahimovic PSG must now put their trust</p> <p>The Swede\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity in the last moments stood out as rare, Ibrahimovic having previously stirred only to sting Courtois\xe2\x80\x99s hands early in the second half having slalomed his way between defenders. There was to be no personal reward to stamp his influence on the tie. Regardless, the French side must now pin their hopes on him to prove more effective back in London. A year ago his hamstring had pinged in Paris to leave him sidelined as Cavani fluffed his lines at Stamford Bridge. This time he should travel fit and focused as he attempts to break his duck against Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s teams. The striker scored 28 goals in 46 matches for the Portuguese at Internazionale, yet he has never scored against him in seven attempts. Surely that must change if Chelsea are to be beaten in the return.</p>'
