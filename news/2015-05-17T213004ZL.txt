b'<p>Blinded by blizzards of statistics, deluged in seas of digitalised performance analysis data and sidetracked by Moneyball theories, it is all too easy for modern managers to overlook the human factor.</p> <p>Fortunately for Leicester City, Nigel Pearson believes nothing is more important than making time to talk to players, learn about their lives and establish relationships.</p> <p>Kasper Schmeichel believes the manager\xe2\x80\x99s ability to connect represents a big reason why, against all odds, Leicester secured Premier League survival on a blustery Wearside afternoon.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNigel Pearson cares,\xe2\x80\x9d said the goalkeeper. \xe2\x80\x9cHe cares deeply not just about football but about his players on and off the pitch. How their lives are going. It means a lot to players when you have a manager who cares so deeply about you as an individual, not just as a player.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In return Leciester\xe2\x80\x99s squad leapt through metaphorical hoops of flame for Pearson as they collected 19 points from their final eight games of the season. \xe2\x80\x9cThe boss has been immense; he\xe2\x80\x99s the best manager I\xe2\x80\x99ve played under,\xe2\x80\x9d Schmeichel said. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone has got to know that the Nigel Pearson they see and the Nigel Pearson we see are two very different people. He\xe2\x80\x99s a charismatic guy, a born leader.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe has a great sense of humour and an energy that transmits to the lads. His enthusiasm for football is infectious. I think he\xe2\x80\x99s the manager of the year. I know I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to have him as my boss.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Rather like Howard Wilkinson, incidentally his key mentor, Pearson has a somewhat dour, occasionally downright awkward, facade.</p> <p>Perhaps it was Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s human qualities that persuaded Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s clearly split board to perform a U-turn and overrule an apparent decision to sack their manager, reputedly firing and re-instating him within a matter of hours during a chaotic February evening. \xe2\x80\x9cThe owners deserve huge credit for not pressing the panic button and trusting the staff and the players,\xe2\x80\x9d Schmeichel said.</p> <p>Even when they seemed glued to the bottom of the table there was always a paradox about Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s team. Whereas sides such as Sunderland picked up points from poor displays, Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s performances regularly outstripped results.</p> <p>A source of considerable frustration, this disconnect also offered hope. \xe2\x80\x9cWe always felt we were playing well,\xe2\x80\x9d Pearson said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s been difficult to go to certain places and not come away with something. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to lie \xe2\x80\x93 there\xe2\x80\x99ve been moments where you questioned whether we could do it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Retaining the faith of a squad as result after result goes awry often proves impossible but Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s manager kept talking to his players and his combination of emotional intelligence and tactical sharpness paid off.</p> <p>If a switch to a three-man defence facilitated by the signing of Robert Huth on loan from Stoke at the end of January represented a watershed, the apparently unbreakable bond between manager and dressing room proved pivotal to their escape.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was about being true to ourselves and playing the way we believe is right,\xe2\x80\x9d Schmeichel said. \xe2\x80\x9cSpirits were always high and belief was even higher. It was just a case of finding the luck that would turn things around.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The start of Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s renaissance coincided with the end of Gus Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s Sunderland tenure. Poor, muddled and often contradictory communication arguably helped provoke the Uruguayan\xe2\x80\x99s downfall. In came Dick Advocaat, along with a clarity that has played a big part in the collection of 11 points from the seven games he has presided over.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a very straight-talking manager,\xe2\x80\x9d Connor Wickham said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know what he wants, what his demands are.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Thwarted by Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s well-organised defence, Wickham and his team-mates could not quite manage the win needed to banish relegation concerns and they looked on enviously as their jubilant Leicester counterparts cavorted across the pitch at the final whistle.</p> <p>Should Hull fail to beat Manchester United at the KC Stadium on Sunday, Sunderland will be safe regardless but, as things stand, they require a point from their remaining two games \xe2\x80\x93 at Arsenal and Chelsea \xe2\x80\x93 to guarantee Premier League status.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEverything\xe2\x80\x99s still in our own hands,\xe2\x80\x99 said Advocaat, who had reason to be grateful for excellent performances from Lee Cattermole and Sebasti\xc3\xa1n Coates. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m confident.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Sunderland officials have been impressed by the time the manager spends talking to players, getting to know them as people rather than mere pieces on a tactics board. Like Pearson, Advocaat knows better than to underestimate the importance of the human factor.</p> <p>Man of the match Sebasti\xc3\xa1n Coates (Sunderland)</p>'
