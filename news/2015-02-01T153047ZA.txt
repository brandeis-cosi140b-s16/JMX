b'<p>As Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s players left the pitch at the final whistle amid a chorus of applause, one thought quickly sprang to mind: they\xe2\x80\x99ve done this without Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez. The Gunners top-scorer and undisputed player of the season was absent with a hamstring injury, yet the side still sparkled. Five goals were scored by five players in a collective showing of devastating ruthlessness and one which adds fuel to the belief that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s men will yet again clinch a place in the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s top four.</p> <p>They sit in fifth and, after Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s defeat by Swansea City, are level on points with Ronald Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s side. Crucially, Arsenal have won three successive league fixtures for the first time this campaign, as well as showing a thrilling thirst for goals, with this rout making it 13 scored in their last four outings in all competitions. S\xc3\xa1nchez will only add to the potency upon his return.</p> <p>If that is a chilling thought for those teams battling with Arsenal for a Champions League place, some hope can be taken from Aston Villa\xe2\x80\x99s performance here. The visitors controlled proceedings for large spells, overall enjoying 52% of possession, and had Andreas Weimann or Christian Benteke made more of their close-range efforts either side of half-time, when Arsenal were only 1-0 up, things could have been very different. As Paul Lambert, the Villa manager, observed: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a strange game, never a 5-0 game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Aston Villa\xe2\x80\x99s defensive naivety plays into rampant Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s hands | Michael Cox </p>   <p>Yet ultimately here was proof that when Arsenal are in the mood there are few, if any, sides in the country better equipped at slicing through opposition, with their first three goals, scored by Olivier Giroud, Mesut \xc3\x96zil and Theo Walcott, all coming in blink-of-an-eye breakaway surges.</p> <p>The first was arguably the best. With Villa pressing aggressively and high up the pitch, Per Mertesacker hooked the ball into midfield where \xc3\x96zil moved it on to Giroud with a sumptuous first-time, over-the-shoulder flick. The Frenchman had a clear path towards goal and with defenders rushing back into position, he kept his cool and lifted the ball over the outrushing Brad Guzan.</p> <p>The second, on 56 minutes, came after another attack from Villa, who were admirably attempting to halt a woeful run of five games without a goal. \xc3\x96zil and Giroud swapped roles, with the latter feeding the German after Walcott had won possession. \xc3\x96zil, coming infield from the left wing, finished coolly for his second goal in as many games.</p>  <p> Related: Southampton 0-1 Swansea City | Premier League match report </p>   <p>By the time Walcott made it 3-0 just after the hour mark with a first-time shot, having quickly exchanged passes with Santi Cazorla, the game was all but over as a contest. Lambert was left to rue what might have been had Weimann directed his header from Carles Gil\xe2\x80\x99s cross just before the break further away from the reach of David Ospina, and Benteke done more to test the Arsenal goalkeeper with an unmarked drive soon after play had resumed.</p> <p>Even Wenger had sympathy for the visitors. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel a bit for Villa because they gave a lot,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Frenchman. \xe2\x80\x9cThe second goal was a real blow for them but overall they fought very hard.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut in general our offensive game was good today. We always looked dangerous when we got through their lines, and defensively we were sound as well. This was a positive day for us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: January\xe2\x80\x99s deadline day keeps punters glued but managers can come unstuck | Sean Ingle </p>   <p>Of that there was no doubt and Arsenal, as their manager stated, caught the eye with their sturdiness at the back and with their ruthlessness in attack. Francis Coquelin again impressed as a holding midfielder while the four defenders behind him also generally looked assured. Watching from the bench, the new \xc2\xa311.3m Brazilian centre-back Gabriel Paulista may have wondered how and when he will get into this side.</p> <p>Cazorla, who was yet again outstanding for the hosts, made it 4-0 with a less-than-outstanding penalty on 75 minutes, with H\xc3\xa9ctor Beller\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s low finish in stoppage time putting the cap on what was the first occasion this season that Arsenal had scored five times in a match. Next is Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s north London derby: sixth-placed Tottenham Hotspur versus fifth with both teams in encouraging form; it promises to be some clash.</p> <p>For Aston Villa, it is now eight league games without victory and, as part of that spell, a little over 10 hours without a goal. For all the positives they can take from this fixture, that is a desperate run and with Chelsea to come next, the rot is unlikely to halt soon. In the circumstances it was no surprise to hear Lambert suggest that having signed Scott Sinclair on loan from Manchester City last week \xe2\x80\x93 he made his debut as a second-half substitute here \xe2\x80\x93 he is looking to add to the squad before Monday\xe2\x80\x99s transfer deadline.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t print what I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling at the moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Scot. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be in this position \xe2\x80\x93 we\xe2\x80\x99ve been in it for too long. All we can do is keep persevering and working hard. There are still twists and turns to come this season.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Man of the match Santi Cazorla (Arsenal)</p>  <p> Related: Arsenal v Aston Villa: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened! </p> '
