b'Champions League round-up: Porto rescue draw at Shakhtar Donetsk'


b'<p>The Porto substitute Jackson Mart\xc3\xadnez scored twice in the final moments of his side\xe2\x80\x99s game at Shakhtar Donetsk to rescue a dramatic draw, and preserve their unbeaten record this season. Alex Teixeira had given Shakhtar the lead shortly and they seemed on course for victory when Luiz Adriano added a second. But Mart\xc3\xadnez halved the deficit with an 89th-minute penalty after Yaroslav Rakitsky handled a cross from Adri\xc3\xa1n L\xc3\xb3pez, and scored again from close range following Cristian Tello\xe2\x80\x99s pass in the final moments of stoppage time to secure a 2-2 draw.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI do not want to talk much,\xe2\x80\x9d the Shakhtar coach, Mircea Lucescu, said afterwards. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a great deal of euphoria and joy at the end of the game and then we conceded two goals \xe2\x80\xa6 It is very hard.\xe2\x80\x9d The match attracted a full house of 34,000 despite being played in Lviv, over 1,000km from Dontesk, which is held by pro-Russian rebels.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Group H Bate Borisov beat Athletic Bilbao 2-1. Denis Polyakov headed in at the far post after the ball was sent across the goalmouth by Nikolai Signevich in the 19th minute, and the roles were reversed when Karnitski scored from Signevich\xe2\x80\x99s pass in the 41st minute, with his shot wrong-footing goalkeeper Gorka Iraizoz who lost his balance. Aritz Aduriz pulled one back for Bilbao on the counter-attack from a pass by Iker Munaian just before half-time.</p> <p>In Group F Ajax were held 1-1 by Apoel Nicosia, with both goals coming in the space of three first-half minutes. Ajax opened the scoring in the 28th minute through Danish forward Lucas Andersen, only for Apoel\xe2\x80\x99s Brazilian midfielder Gustavo Manduca to level from the penalty spot three minutes later. The draw extended Ajax\xe2\x80\x99s winless away streak in the Champions League to eight games and gave the Cypriot team its first point in this season\xe2\x80\x99s competition.</p> <p>Schalke and Maribor drew 1-1 at the Veltins-Arena, Damjan Bohar putting Maribor in front from Mitja Viler\xe2\x80\x99s cross in the first half only for Klaas-Jan Huntelaar to equalise with a cool finish from just outside the box after Mitja Viler\xe2\x80\x99s disastrous back-pass. \xe2\x80\x9cWe started well but then we conceded a stupid counter-attack goal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Huntelaar, whose side dominated much of the match as Maribor sat back and attacked occasionally on the break. \xe2\x80\x9cWe made it difficult for ourselves. We were slow and careless and made too many mistakes.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Schalke had chances to seal victory, but Maribor\xe2\x80\x99s goalkeeper Jasmin Handanovic made two saves from Julian Draxler, and Kevin-Prince Boateng\xe2\x80\x99s volley sailed wide.</p> <p>Both teams are now two points behind Chelsea in Group G. \xe2\x80\x9cWe should have used our chances,\xe2\x80\x9d Schalke coach Jens Keller said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe played well early in the game. We showed will power and we tried our best, there is nothing to reproach my players. We conceded a stupid goal and once they went ahead it was difficult. Maribor defended very deep.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
