b'Brazil 1-0 Colombia - as it happened'


b'<p>Final thoughts</p> <p>So a wild affair comes to a close and Dunga gets a win to start his return to the Brazil top job, while Neymar caps a very good performance with a great goal. It\xe2\x80\x99s a shame the balance of the game was so tilted by the red card to Cuadrado, though in fairness to the referee the first half had been full of wild challenges and if it hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been the luckless Cuadrado you felt it would have been...someone...the way the game was going.</p> <p>Colombia retreated after thesending off, while Brazil showed some inventive approach play without looking like they had a truly elite cutting edge to do enough with the chances they made. But then Neymar stepped up to drop that free kick into the top corner and that was that.</p> <p>Just as importantly for Brazil though, a defense that had conceded ten in their last two games kept a clean sheet, and in truth rarely looked like being breached \xe2\x80\x94 their organization and anticipation looked to be a point of pride. </p> <p>Brazil now move on to New Jersey to face Ecuador in a few days, while Colombia will face the same opposition in October, perhaps focussing on the bigger picture good news that Falcao is back.</p> <p>From me though, that\xe2\x80\x99s it. Thanks for joining me tonight and good night.</p>'
