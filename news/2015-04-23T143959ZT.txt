b'<p>HEIR JORDAN</p> <p>When Liverpool paid upwards of \xc2\xa320m for Jordan Henderson in June 2011, there was much t1ttering and giggling at such an outlandish sum being paid for a player who had yet to celebrate his 21st birthday, had never been photographed smoking a shisha pipe or inhaling laughing gas in the manner of most up-and-coming talents and whose form the previous season had dipped to such an extent that even Sunderland fans had taken to booing him. Who\xe2\x80\x99s laughing now, eh?</p> <p>Jordan Henderson, that\xe2\x80\x99s who. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, he\xe2\x80\x99s laughing all the way to the bank after inking a new five-year deal worth \xc2\xa3100,000 basic a week, which will enable him to trouser \xc2\xa326m before bonuses and the like between now and 2021. And while that might not seem like a great deal of money, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem such a pittance once you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken into account the huge additional sums he\xe2\x80\x99ll get for turning up, doing the odd goal here and there, drawing and winning matches, and appearing in deodorant advertisements. Indeed, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably safe to say that the next generation of Hendersons is unlikely to go hungry, unless daddy invests in a Ponzi scheme, develops a crippling gambling addiction or decides to invest all his money in Tesco, the supermarket chain that recently pulled off the rather impressive feat of losing \xc2\xa36.4bn in one year.</p> <p>Purchased at the behest of then manager Kenny Dalglish, who claimed Liverpool were investing in the youngster\xe2\x80\x99s potential, Henderson has gone on to vindicate his former gaffer\xe2\x80\x99s faith in him by become a hard-working, controversy-free staple in Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s midfield. And having demonstrated his natural leadership qualities (and surprisingly decent thespian skills) by taking the lead role in a Nivea ad over his team-mates Raheem Sterling and Simon Mignolet, Henderson has shown he will be difficult for Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 successor to ignore when it comes to handing over the Liverpool captain\xe2\x80\x99s armband to $$$tevie Mbe\xe2\x80\x99s successor as skipper.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI never really thought it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hender$on, whose Mr 15% helped him trouser an extra \xc2\xa35.2m by forlornly shaking his head when an Anfield bean-counter slid a piece of paper with the number \xc2\xa380,000 his way across the boardroom table. \xe2\x80\x9cFor me it was just a case of leaving it to the club and my [Mr 15%] to sort it out. I always said that I wanted to stay at Liverpool and there was no other club that I would go to. Thankfully today it\xe2\x80\x99s done. I\xe2\x80\x99m over the moon that it\xe2\x80\x99s all done, just so I can concentrate on the future and what needs to be done now.\xe2\x80\x9d Hiring a chauffeur who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t drive a Reliant Robin to red carpet functions might be a start. \xc2\xa3100,000 per week to play football? It\xe2\x80\x99s not Chekhov but it\xe2\x80\x99ll pay the rent.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Be sure to join Tom Bryant for hot Big Vase quarter-final second-leg clockwatch action from 8.05pm BST.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we got to the checkout and paid, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice that there was also a pack of dried beef and a jar of honey in our bag. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how it happened, I\xe2\x80\x99ve no idea. [We were handcuffed] as you would do with a terrorist. I was obviously in disbelief\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 the big thing to take from Andrea Dossena\xe2\x80\x99s description of his Harrods arrest is his thought that only terrorists get handcuffed.</p> RECOMMENDED LISTENING <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s only Football Weekly Extraaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.</p>      FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x98bagsy shotgun\xe2\x80\x99 (Marten Allen, yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters).

The reaction was ridiculous,\xe2\x80\x9d sniffed graphic designer Angelo Trofa, who made said mistake.</p> <p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger reckons Arsenal fans should show Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas just a little more love, just a little more peace, so that one day soon we\xe2\x80\x99ll live in harmony. \xe2\x80\x9cI want Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas \xe2\x80\xa6 to be respected like he deserves,\xe2\x80\x9d he parped, admittedly giving them a little wriggle room.</p> <p>The deployment of walking red card Sergio Ramos in Real Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s midfield has been hailed as the key to his team\xe2\x80\x99s narrow Big Cup win over Atl\xc3\xa9tico. \xe2\x80\x9cI like coaches who are decent people, but above all those that have character and are ballsy,\xe2\x80\x9d cheered the Team America fan.</p> <p>Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri is giving it some big chat after seeing off Monaco to reach the last four of Big Cup. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I first got here all I asked for was respect,\xe2\x80\x9d he cooed.

If I could get to choose I\xe2\x80\x99d rather not play Bayern.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Speaking of which, FCB are hopeful Pep Guardiola will sign a contract extension to keep him in new strides beyond 2016. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we have very good chances that he remains the coach here,\xe2\x80\x9d cheered club suit Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. \xe2\x80\x9cI cannot imagine that Pep would go to a club like Manchester City.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In non-story news, Aston Villa say they have no comment to make over a published picture of Jack Grealish apparently inhaling laughing gas from a balloon.</p> <p>Mild-mannered Sampdoria president Massimo Ferrero reckons Rafa Ben\xc3\xadtez would be too big-boned to take over as the club\xe2\x80\x99s manager. \xe2\x80\x9cI could take Ben\xc3\xadtez, but I\xe2\x80\x99d have to take him to a dietician first,\xe2\x80\x9d he roared.</p> <p>And Emir Spahic has been banned for three months and fined \xc2\xa314,000 by the German FA for being ridiculous and brawling with two stewards who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow his hangers-on access to Bayer Leverkusen\xe2\x80\x99s dressing room.</p> STILL WANT MORE? <p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho, the anti-Barcelona, stands alone in modern football.
