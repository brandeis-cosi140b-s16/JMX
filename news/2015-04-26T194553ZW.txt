b'Why Arsenal have not missed lightweight Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas this season | Barney Ronay'


b'<p>This was a match that seemed to start grinding to a halt pretty much from kick-off as both teams congealed into a familiar reflection of their more notorious strengths and weaknesses. Arsenal were fluent but lacked a killer edge. Chelsea were full of guile and gristle. Towards the end of what was an absorbing enough room temperature 0-0 draw Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s fans sang: \xe2\x80\x9cBoring, boring Chelsea,\xe2\x80\x9d while the away corner responded: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are top of the league,\xe2\x80\x9d producing between them a real life summary of the tediously irresolvable social media debate about style versus substance, icing on the cake versus medals on the table.</p> <p>There were plenty of virtues on display. Arsenal might have snatched the game at the end. John Terry showed why he has been the most influential player in the Premier League this year. And Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas left the pitch just before the end to loud boos, confirming over 89 minutes not only the exemplary grudge-holding capacity of English football fans, but also the Cesc\xe2\x80\x91flavoured deficiencies in at least one of these teams.</p> <p>One thing can be put to bed after his much-trailed return to the Emirates. Arsenal have missed a few things this season but he isn\xe2\x80\x99t one of them.</p> <p>There is surely no elite level Premier League player who offers such an uneven contribution. With 16 minutes gone at the Emirates, F\xc3\xa0bregas played the pass of the game, looking up and lifting the ball 40 yards down the inside left channel into the path of Oscar. His shot was dinked just wide of the onrushing David Ospina, who flattened the Brazilian while somehow failing to concede a penalty kick.</p> <p>Either side of that, F\xc3\xa0bregas was simply himself, a player of great, gossamer gifts, a half-speed craftsman, and a midfielder who manages to be both pilot and passenger on the same flight. With six minutes gone, he was bypassed for the first time in central midfield, Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez and Aaron Ramsey funnelling the ball forward down the flank with F\xc3\xa0bregas a whirling Dalek in their wake. Ten minutes later he was brushed aside not once but twice on Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s left flank, before finally misplacing a pass to huge gleeful boos. An in-and-out opening 20 minutes ended with a booking for diving in the area, F\xc3\xa0bregas hanging his leg out hopefully as he passed Santi Cazorla but ending up tumbling over thin air.</p> <p>If there were plenty of boos here, there has also been a recurrent suggestion that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger blundered by not bringing F\xc3\xa0bregas back. Albeit presumably only from those who haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen Arsenal play this season. If there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing this team doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need it is another physically lightweight passing midfielder. And yet even in a title-bound season there is a case to be made that F\xc3\xa0bregas isn\xe2\x80\x99t really the player Chelsea need either: a midfielder who for all his creative incision embodies Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s obvious missing quality, a lack of real drive and presence in the heart of the team.</p> <p>When something more assertive was needed at Stamford Bridge against Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s midfield was instead outrun and outfought by a team down to 10 men away from home. Too often F\xc3\xa0bregas has been invisible since the new year, or bypassed completely when Chelsea play on the break. Eight minutes before half-time here, Willian, Eden Hazard and Ramires constructed a lovely thrust down the left that led to the Brazilian almost prodding the ball past Ospina. At the time F\xc3\xa0bregas was 40 yards away, chugging gamely upfield like a three-legged dog.</p> <p>On this evidence it isn\xe2\x80\x99t hard to see why F\xc3\xa0bregas\xe2\x80\x99s peers didn\xe2\x80\x99t vote him into the Professional Footballers\xe2\x80\x99 Association\xe2\x80\x99s team of the year. A midfielder who will only pass the ball on, who has no burst of speed to offer another option is always easier to play against. And so he has become a containable high-class player, a kind of footballing Stephen Hawking, the trundling mega\xe2\x80\x91brain in need of a supporting entourage to wheel him into place.</p> <p>There was a change for F\xc3\xa0bregas in the second half, Didier Drogba\xe2\x80\x99s introduction in place of Oscar leaving F\xc3\xa0bregas in the No10 role and Chelsea with surely the most grandly immobile title-bound attack in Premier League history. But it was enough to see out the game with strength in reserve and bring the title a step closer. What happens next may be just as interesting.</p> <p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho, the arch-pragmatist, knows better than anyone the qualities of his players. F\xc3\xa0bregas has been good enough to provide a major push towards another domestic title. But you wonder how long before Mourinho concedes publicly that perhaps Barcelona were right \xe2\x80\x93 that at the higher level, as the fulcrum of a genuinely top class, Champions League-chasing team, F\xc3\xa0bregas is simply not mobile enough, not versatile enough, destined perhaps to spend the final third of his career as a Mozart of the elite second-rankers. Chelsea will take their title, to which F\xc3\xa0bregas has made a hugely effective contribution. But both will perhaps expect a little more next season.</p>'
