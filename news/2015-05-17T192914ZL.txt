b'Louis van Gaal tells David de Gea: Real won\xe2\x80\x99t love you like United do'


b'<p>Louis van Gaal has warned David de Gea of how much he will lose should the goalkeeper leave Manchester United for Real Madrid, with fears growing that Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 1-1 draw with Arsenal may be his last game for the team as the Spaniard injured a hamstring.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can persuade him because he knows everything he has at Manchester United,\xe2\x80\x9d said Van Gaal after seeing Ander Herrera\xe2\x80\x99s goal on 30 minutes cancelled out by a late Tyler Blackett own goal. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have to say something because he can feel it every day. You have seen the fans \xe2\x80\x93 unbelievable. When he is going, he is losing that. Here he has a lot of credits. He has to decide.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Manchester United 1-1 Arsenal | Premier League match report </p>   <p>De Gea was replaced after 74 minutes by Victor Vald\xc3\xa9s, who made his debut. Van Gaal signalled that United will not allow De Gea to leave without a fight. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is from Spain and he has a Spanish girlfriend but the club won\xe2\x80\x99t let him go easily.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The 24-year-old goalkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s contract expires in the summer of 2016 and he has yet to agree fresh terms worth a basic \xc2\xa3150,000 a week offered by United. Despite the attractions for De Gea of moving to Real the decision is still proving difficult, Van Gaal said, evidence that the player may yet stay put. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are asking things I cannot answer because I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I have also said a transfer is an individual thing. It is also a process,\xe2\x80\x9d the manager added. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has to decide because we have given a fantastic contract because we want him to stay. Fantastic season, I think.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI analyse his position and then I say he is Spanish, he is Spanish international, still behind Iker Casilla. Now a Spanish club is coming, his girlfriend is Spanish, his father and mother come every week or every two weeks here, so it is difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Gaal claimed he has no knowledge whether Real have made a formal offer for De Gea. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not doing that kind of thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, while suggesting the goalkeeper will struggle to be fit for Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s final match, the trip to Hull City. \xe2\x80\x9cHis injury is a hamstring injury so it shall be difficult to play but you never know. Every player is difficult to replace,\xe2\x80\x9d said Van Gaal. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery player has his contribution to the result.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The manager refused to state if Vald\xc3\xa9s could be the new United No1 if required. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to wait and see how we decide. I cannot say anything about transfers or what I like to say to the players because first I shall talk with the players and at the end with the media.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The future of Radamel Falcao, who is on loan from Monaco, is also in the balance although the Colombian started ahead of Robin van Persie only to be replaced by the Dutchman after 61 minutes.</p> <p>Van Gaal would not be drawn on whether Falcao will be at Old Trafford next season. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know how the situation is. At the end of the season we will decide,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Regarding the result, Van Gaal was unhappy at how United again failed to kill off the game, which has been a pattern this season. \xe2\x80\x9cThe difference between Chelsea and Manchester United is that they can finish a game.</p>  <p> Related: Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger rewarded for his adventurous switch of emphasis | Michael Cox </p>   <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey can kill the game. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Arsenal can do it because they lost also 1-0 last week and also Manchester City cannot do it and I think that is the difference between the top four.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the mentality we have to improve.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Arsenal require only a point from Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s home game against Sunderland to secure third position and avoid having to play in the Champions League knockout round in August.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt takes the pressure off during the holidays and during the preparation. We have always that in mind when you prepare and it will be great when we do it, but it is still to do,\xe2\x80\x9d said the manager Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger.</p> <p>With United likely to finish fourth, Van Gaal concurred. \xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne Wenger has described that very well \xe2\x80\x93 stressful days, you can meet a club who is halfway through a season and we have to start a season so it is difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
