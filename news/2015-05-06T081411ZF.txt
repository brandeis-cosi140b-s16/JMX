b'Football transfer rumours: Zlatan Ibrahimovic set to leave PSG for Milan?'


b'<p>Here\xe2\x80\x99s a good one: according to France Football, the owners of Paris Saint-Germain are increasingly concerned that Zlatan Ibrahimovic is giving Qatar a bad name! The Swede\xe2\x80\x99s recent angry outburst following a defeat to Bordeaux \xe2\x80\x93 during which Ibrahimovic suggested that France is a \xe2\x80\x9cshit country\xe2\x80\x9d that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve PSG \xe2\x80\x93 has got the club\xe2\x80\x99s bosses fearing that some silly folks might start associating arrogant rich brats with Qatar! Word is the Qatari owners are giving serious consideration to giving the 33-year-old nearly \xc2\xa312m in return for the final year of his contract if he agrees to bugger off this summer. Paying to make bad news go away, that\xe2\x80\x99s the Qatari way.</p> <p>So who would want a troublesome striker deemed unmanageable by some? Hark, is that Brendan Rodgers flying to the rescue? Or just another plane calling on Rodgers to be sacked?</p> <p>So who would want an ageing big-name striker who\xe2\x80\x99ll command humongous wages? Say, are those Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s ears pricking up? If so, they can possibly hear the laughing of Jorge Mendes, who is the agent of both David de Gea and Radamel Falcao and is reportedly telling United that if they want to hold on to the goalkeeper this summer, then they have to keep the striker, too. Falcao is a striker, in case you\xe2\x80\x99d forgotten.</p> <p>As for Zlatan, the most likely destination for him is Milan, whose new Thai part-owner has his heart set on the Swede. He also quite fancies Roma\xe2\x80\x99s Belgian midfielder Radja Nainggolan, who is being courted by United, too, as well as Manchester City. What is more, someone has convinced City that the answer to their left-back problems is Danny Rose, so they are going to submit a \xc2\xa315m offer for the player. Daniel Levy likes to drag big transfers out and it is expected that his approach to this one will involve \xe2\x80\xa6 saying \xe2\x80\x9cthanks very much\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger, who is celebrated for his ability to spot French talent and snap it up from the non-French club that spotted it before him, has his keen eye set on Real Madrid centre-back Rapha\xc3\xabl Varane, who was last seen losing sight of Carlos Tevez during Tuesday night\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League semi-final. Arsenal are also mulling over bids for the Monaco\xe2\x80\x99s Algerian centre-back Aymen Abdennour, Lyon\xe2\x80\x99s tricky attacking midfielder Nabil Fekir and PSG\xe2\x80\x99s reserve left-back Lucas Digne, though the latter is also being wooed by Juventus, who see him as the long-term replacement to Patrice Evra.</p> <p>Chelsea are going shopping in France too, with Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho eager to get Lyon\xe2\x80\x99s ace goal-getter Alexandre Lacazette.</p> <p>Twenty year-old Vit\xc3\xb3ria Guimar\xc3\xa3es midfielder Bernard Mensah, who has been described as the new Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 by some and not Paul Pogba by others, is wanted by Manchester United. Meanwhile, Real Madrid are said to be closing in on Pogba.</p> <p>Tottenham are checking out Marseille goalkeeper Steve Mandanda, with a view to signing Hugo Lloris\xe2\x80\x99s deputy in the France squad if Lloris leaves White Hart Lane in the summer.</p> <p>Bournemouth are poised to fork out a club record \xc2\xa35m for Sporting Braga striker \xc3\x89der, who has scored 23 goals in 44 league games so far this season.</p> <p>Finally, Newcastle have reportedly agreed to splurge \xc2\xa315m on Anderlecht\xe2\x80\x99s Aleksandar Mitrovic, though the striker would presumably have to undergo a strict medical before signing and, if John Carver is still in charge, that would presumably entail having his nose bust and eyes cut just to make sure he has what it takes to represent the Toon.</p>'
