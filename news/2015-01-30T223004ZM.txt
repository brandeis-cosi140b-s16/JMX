b'Manuel Pellegrini rejects Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s Chelsea conspiracy theory'


b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini dismissed Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s claim there is a campaign against Chelsea as the Manchester City manager prepared to take the champions to Stamford Bridge for Saturday evening\xe2\x80\x99s pivotal Premier League match.</p> <p>The Portuguese, who will be without the suspended Diego Costa, cancelled his Friday press conference over his ongoing issue with the media and other managers, who he perceives to be influencing match officials.</p> <p>Mourinho previously did not attend a briefing ahead of playing Newcastle United earlier this month, instead sending his assistant Steve Holland after being charged by the Football Association for stating there was a \xe2\x80\x9cclear campaign\xe2\x80\x9d against Chelsea, following the 1-1 draw at Southampton in December, for which he was fined \xc2\xa325,000 this week.</p> <p>When asked about this, Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cI hope that in the Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 the most important league in the world \xe2\x80\x93 they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a campaign against anyone. I hope all is fair and the referee makes mistakes for all the teams exactly the same, that the FA make the fixtures in a fair way and the punishments.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFor my way of thinking I think it is the best league in the world and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it has any strange things. Because [if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case] then you are not competing [fairly]. After that, if you win the title, it\xe2\x80\x99s not an important title, because it is all arranged.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini believes Costa should change his on-field behaviour following his three-match suspension for stamping on Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Emre Can in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s Capital One Cup semi-final win.</p> <p>Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9c[Costa] is a great player; a very important player. He has his character, it is not an easy character but I hope for him that this punishment, I am not trying to take advantage for the game [tonight], I think it will be a good thing for him to change in the future because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to do it in that way, because he is a very good player, a top player.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know Diego Costa; I know of him from Spain. For me, he\xe2\x80\x99s a very good player. But maybe this will be good for him for the future.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Chilean is clear that City are going to west London for victory. \xe2\x80\x9cI always play to win the game. I think if you want to draw, I think normally you lose,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI expect a very good Chelsea \xe2\x80\x93 a good defensive team who are very good at counter-attacks.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini also aimed a barb at Chelsea when defending last week\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Abu Dhabi. City arrived back from the warm weather break in the emirate less than 24 hours before losing to Middlesbrough in the FA Cup last weekend. Yet after Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side were also knocked out of the competition, Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cAbout last week, another club that didn\xe2\x80\x99t travel to Abu Dhabi also lost in the FA Cup. It was not the reason we lost. This week was a normal week and we worked well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s injury worries, meanwhile, are confined to Samir Nasri and Eliaquim Mangala for the trip to Chelsea. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a small problem with Samir Nasri coming back, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he is 100% fit. We will see with the doctor but he worked the last two days with the squad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pellegrini of the Frenchman, who is recovering from a calf injury. \xe2\x80\x9cMangala had a small problem with his shoulder today, we will see tomorrow. They are the only two small problems we have.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
