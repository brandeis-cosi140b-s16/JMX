b'Football transfer rumours: Mesut \xc3\x96zil to Bayern Munich?'


b'<p>Despite their failure to sign Mats Hummels during the summer, Manchester United are expected to step up their efforts to sign Borussia Dortmund\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup-winning central defender in the new year. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is going nowhere,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Bundesliga side\xe2\x80\x99s manager J\xc3\xbcrgen Klopp in August. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is staying with us.\xe2\x80\x9d Dortmund managed to hold on to their new captain despite interest from United and Arsenal, among other clubs, but tabloid reports on Monday suggest that the United boss Louis van Gaal has ordered club bean-counters to hose the Westfalenstadion with cash until their German counterparts have no option but to relent and sell.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Germany, Bayern Munich are hoping to lure Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s record signing, the occasionally maligned midfielder Mesut \xc3\x96zil back to his homeland in January, with a price-tag of \xe2\x82\xac40m being mentioned in conjunction with any mooted move. With Mathieu Debuchy facing two months on the sidelines as he recovers from the severely sprained ankle he suffered in an awkward fall against Manchester City on Saturday, Arsenal are down to the bare bones in defence and may be forced to phone the Job Centre to see if they have any unemployed and out of contract job-seeking defenders available to provide cover at the Emirates.</p> <p>The Gunners are also reported to be interested in securing the services of Valencia\xe2\x80\x99s 21-year-old striker Paco Alc\xc3\xa1cer, who scored his side\xe2\x80\x99s final goal in a 3-1 La Liga win over Espanyol on Sunday, but will face stiff competition from Chelsea, who are also sniffing around the young Spaniard. Alc\xc3\xa1cer made his international debut last week, scoring one and creating another in his country\xe2\x80\x99s 5-1 win over Macedonia. The player\xe2\x80\x99s contract runs until 2016 and has a \xc2\xa315m buy-out clause, so there should be no shortage of willing takers at what seems a bargain price for a goal-getting striker.</p> <p>Southampton fans will be displeased to learn that, with Manchester City midfielder James Milner pondering his future and dithering over whether or not to sign a new contract, the Premier League champions have decided that James Ward-Prowse and Jay Rodriguez are both talented and home-grown enough to replace him.</p> <p>Meanwhile in Liverpool, left-back Glen Johnson will spend the new year admiring the Vatican, Colosseum, Trevi Fountain and assorted other delights Rome have to offer the discerning visitor if Roma get their way. The 30-year-old is out of contract at the end of this season and word has it that Liverpool might let him go in January for \xc2\xa32m rather than lose him for nothing come season\xe2\x80\x99s end. Roma may also find themselves in possession of one Juan Mata, with the Manchester United midfielder likely to be offered to the Serie A side as part of any deal to bring Dutch enforcer Kevin Strootman to Old Trafford.</p> <p>Despite the Guardian\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew will not be fired this week, out-of-work managers David Moyes and Tony Pulis, and Southampton boss Ronald Koeman and his Hull City counterpart Steve Bruce are all being mentioned as potential candidates to take over at St James\xe2\x80\x99s Park, should Newcastle owner Mike Ashley decide to replace his current human shield. Supporter dissatisfaction with Pardew is at an all time high in Newcastle, although it\xe2\x80\x99s long been obvious that his employer cares not two hoots for the opinions of Newcastle fans who would like nothing better than to see him sell up the club and get out of Dodge. Should Pardew get the boot, Ashley will almost certainly seek a replacement who can help the club avoid relegation but not qualify for the Europa League, a task that probably isn\xe2\x80\x99t beyond the wit of any of the four candidates named above.</p> <p>Back in Spain, Barcelona forward Pedro is miffed at the amount of time he\xe2\x80\x99s being forced to spend on the bench and could try to force a January move elsewhere. Arsenal and Liverpool are monitoring his situation with interest.</p>'
