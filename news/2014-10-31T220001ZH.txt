b'How Manchester United became the new noisy neighbours | Barney Ronay'


b'<p>Here we go then, same old Manchester derby. Settled champion team against big-spending upstarts. Well-grooved star names against a roster of new faces. Commercially sensitive owners against financial incontinents. And above all a measured, trophy winning machine against some galvanising memories of glory. All things considered Manchester City might just feel a little wary right now of those energetic noisy neighbours in the red shirts.</p> <p>This is of course to take a slightly mischievous view of the current state of altered gravity between these two teams. City have still never been past the last 16 of the Champions League and have won two league titles in 46 years. By any sensible measure there is a fair way to go before Peter Schmeichel\xe2\x80\x99s slightly odd suggestion this week that City have now eclipsed Manchester United and become a \xe2\x80\x9cbigger\xe2\x80\x9d club makes any wider sense. But still there are elements of genuine transformation in the ongoing rise and fall of Manchester\xe2\x80\x99s two big city clubs ahead of Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s derby at the Etihad Stadium.</p> <p>It is so far more a rolling back than a reversal. For nearly 20 years from the start of the Premier League City were a mosquito-grade nuisance for United\xe2\x80\x99s champions who between 1993 and 2000 won eight derby matches in a row. Against that City have had three seasons now of uninterrupted ascent, in which period they lead the trophy count 3-1, have won five of the past six league derbies, and can look forward to Sunday as unarguably Manchester\xe2\x80\x99s chief footballing power for the first time since the 1970s.</p> <p>United\xe2\x80\x99s 5-3 capitulation against Leicester City last month was shown on the big screen inside City\xe2\x80\x99s press rooms. Listening to the odd sigh and tut from a passing official, the urge to crow replaced by a wry, what-have-they-done-now sense of fondness, there was a sense that this transformation from red to blue had perhaps gone a little further than most might have imagined possible just 18 months since the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson.</p> <p>And yet within this dynamic there is a sense of further fluidity. Right now Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s noisy neighbours are on a cautious upswing of their own.</p> <p>Despite looking a mess at times this season, a win at the Etihad would leave United just a point behind City with 10 games played. On the other hand City have experienced a quiet congealment, winning just twice at home \xe2\x80\x93 against Sheffield Wednesday and Tottenham \xe2\x80\x93 in six matches going back to August. City remain favourites to win on Sunday but there is a feeling of altered momentum and ungauged progress. It is, above all, an intriguing moment for the 168th Manchester derby to come rolling around.</p> <p>The shifting tone and texture of the two teams comes back, as ever, to spending power. City have had a rather deflating year in the transfer market, spending \xc2\xa353m on two defenders, a goalkeeper and a defensive midfielder across the last two windows. In the same period United have splurged the best part of \xc2\xa3200m on six players, among them the sublime attacking riches of \xc3\x81ngel Di Mar\xc3\xada, Juan Mata and Radamel Falcao, while even the defensive recruits Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo and Daley Blind look suspiciously flighty and forward looking. When it comes to aggressive investment in headline attacking players there is, right now, only one team in manchester \xe2\x80\x93 and it turns out they wear red.</p> <p>City have of course been reined in generally by financial fair play rules and by the determination of the club\xe2\x80\x99s hierarchy to build a lasting infrastructure rather than simply applying a glaze on top. Still though, it must be said this is an ageing City team that could have really done with a star attacking signing to ginger up that A-list front line, a Di Mar\xc3\xada or a Falcao of their own, not least with David Silva now injured.</p> <p>Last season City spent \xc2\xa357m on energetic support acts in the shape of Jes\xc3\xbas Navas, Stefan Jovetic and \xc3\x81lvaro Negredo. The year before brought another \xc2\xa367m, of which only Fernandinho has made any lasting impression. At the end of which City\xe2\x80\x99s best players in attack and midfield \xe2\x80\x93 Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9, David Silva, Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero, Edin Dzeko and Samir Nasri \xe2\x80\x93 have all been at the club for at least three years. Aguero, 26 and a little fragile, is the youngest. The squad is still hearteningly strong. But it is perhaps looking a little slow-cooked.</p> <p>Which is where the flaws in Schmeichel\xe2\x80\x99s comments present themselves. City may have won more trophies of late but it is United\xe2\x80\x99s history \xe2\x80\x93 the name, the brand, supremely well-geared global marketing reach \xe2\x80\x93 that has allowed them to out-spend their neighbours so prodigiously in the last year. This is what tradition and a global name buys you now: the ability, within Uefa rules, to buy a one-season player for \xc2\xa316m, not to mention the guts of a high grade first eleven bolted into place over 12 months like a Formula One tyre change.</p> <p>For all that City still have exactly the right points of strength to gouge their fingernails into United\xe2\x80\x99s points of weakness. Silva\xe2\x80\x99s absence may restrict their ability to exploit the gaps behind United\xe2\x80\x99s defence on the flanks. But Ag\xc3\xbcero is a master of finding space, a player who was born on the half turn, and he will relish the chinks of light behind Blind and in between the two centre backs.</p> <p>In the corresponding fixture last year Marouane Fellaini was traumatised by Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s movement and passing, and ended the game chasing Navas down the right wing with all the conviction of a half-cut middle-aged man stumbling across Piccadilly gardens in pursuit of the last night bus home. Fellaini will probably get a chance to put this right on Sunday, but it is hard to imagine a more pronounced test of his recent mini-revival. Against this United\xe2\x80\x99s attack has looked high grade at times. Wayne Rooney will be fired up on his return from suspension (note to younger readers: this is sometimes a good thing). While Eliaquim Mangala, so assured against Chelsea, has looked utterly spooked in the last few weeks. Mart\xc3\xadn Demichelis will surely partner Vincent Kompany at the Etihad.</p> <p>No doubt much will depend on how effectively City\xe2\x80\x99s stars, and in particular Tour\xc3\xa9, the hammer of United in recent seasons, can click back into gear. For their part this United will no doubt remain relentlessly watchable, win lose or draw, the most notable gift so far of the Van Gaal era. Either way a derby of changing colours and changing times already looks like one of the more fascinating encounters of another season of flux in English football\xe2\x80\x99s champion city.</p>'
