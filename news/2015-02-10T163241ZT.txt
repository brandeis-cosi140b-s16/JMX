b'<p>THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO LOUIS LONG BAAL</p> <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to mock, but statistics can help us better understand the world around us. Here\xe2\x80\x99s one by way of illustration: 57% of the folk who willingly spend more than three seconds per decade analysing data from football, a game conceived back in the 1850s as a fun diversion from the mundanities of work, subsist on a predominantly meat-paste-based diet. Another 26% wear slacks consisting of 70% polyester, 20% cotton, and 10% dried juices from food-flavoured spreads. And 15% are listed on at least one official State Department register, and accordingly monitored by the authorities, for the greater good of society. But a few normal people read stats, too, required to pore over them for purposes of work rather than pleasure. Economists, for example. Or scientists, or structural engineers. Or Louis van Gaal, who needs them for his job at Manchester United, where his chief responsibilities appear to be starting arguments in press conferences, and wearing an affronted look on his coupon in press conferences, if the fruits of the first eight months of his labour at Old Trafford are anything to go by.</p> <p>So instead of spending the last couple of days doing something constructive \xe2\x80\x93 eg coaching his underwhelming albeit increasingly resilient team to make them a little more United-y, in the wake of another workaday performance at West Ham, or double-checking Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao\xe2\x80\x99s birth certificates to make sure the pair aren\xe2\x80\x99t in fact in their mid 40s \xe2\x80\x93 Van Gaal has been sat in his office for the past two days seething, simmering and scribbling. He\xe2\x80\x99s got the funk having been mercilessly teased by Hammers boss Sam Allardyce who, having one of his I Am Allardici moments, referred to the revered Dutch tactician\xe2\x80\x99s team as \xe2\x80\x9cLong Ball United\xe2\x80\x9d and wondered if the press would \xe2\x80\x9ccriticise Van Gaal for playing long balls as much as I am sometimes criticised for being direct\xe2\x80\x9d. Fuelled by pique, Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s gone and produced a bespoke four-page dossier of long-ball stats, aimed at refuting Big Sam\xe2\x80\x99s Big Allegation, but also designed to be easily waved around the head during pressers in an expansive and agitated manner, even if the dossier author is wildly hopping from one foot to the other, shaking a fist, regularly firing hot jets of steam from the ears and nose, etc.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen a colleague of mine is saying this kind of thing, you have to see the data and you have to put the data in the right context,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted a highly indignant Van Gaal on Tuesday afternoon, as he expansively waved, wildly hopped, parped hot jets, etc. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have 60% ball possession do you think that you can do that with long balls? Because I expected this question, I have made an interpretation of the data for this game and then I have to say that it is not a good interpretation from Big Sam,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, irritably flicking between pages and running his finger up and down tables in fevered homage to Charles Reep. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not so difficult to read. You have to look at the data and then you will see that we did play long balls, but long balls wide, rather than to the strikers. Long balls, in the width, to switch the play. You can copy it and you can go to Big Sam and he will get a good interpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d He will indeed. Although if he chooses to interpret United\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clong passes forward\xe2\x80\x9d statistic of 49.9% of 83 as impotently hoofing the ball either sideways or backwards once every two minutes \xe2\x80\x93 hey, you can prove anything with stats \xe2\x80\x93 this particular spat will, unlike the aforementioned Van Persie and Falcao, run and run and run.</p> <p>BREAKING NEWS</p> <p>Despite an incident with a sledgehammer and Granny Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s penny jar, The Fiver is again likely to come up short in the bidding for Premier League TV rights, the winner of which should be confirmed here any time now.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSky tried to organise the next season\xe2\x80\x99s fixture to be literally a year after the event, almost on the anniversary, but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite get what they wanted. I was injured, he was suspended. I try not to hold grudges, you have to get on with your life, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any feelings towards the player either way now\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 this excellent interview with Tranmere\xe2\x80\x99s Iain Hume, by Paul Wilson, is very much worth your time, as he discusses a return to Prenton Park, playing in India and that Chris Morgan challenge.</p>      YET MORE OF YOUR MUNDANE ENCOUNTERS WITH FAMOUS PEOPLE \xe2\x80\xa6 <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOne of north London\xe2\x80\x99s best kebab shops was, for me, Sparks on St Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Road (sadly now gentrified into a \xe2\x80\x98Pan-Asian\xe2\x80\x99 takeaway). Technically it was Sparks II, but that is perhaps more detail than you need for this story. One night I was in there getting the full \xe2\x80\x98mix\xe2\x80\x99 (one of each: shish, chicken and kofte) and pondering whether to have chips when an attractive young lady in a posh frock came in. She ordered two large doners and chips, stepped out with the pair of huge greasy parcels and got into a black Range Rover with tinted windows that was waiting outside. As she opened the door, the light came on and I saw that in the passenger seat was the (then-knacked) flamin\xe2\x80\x99 Nasty Leeds winger Harry Kewell; the attractive lady was none other than Sheree Murphy, making her way home from some kind of soap awards. I often wondered whether it was a love of Sparks that made him sign for Galatasaray, and I still don\xe2\x80\x99t know how either of them kept their figures\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Rob Crouch.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMany, many years ago I found myself in the players\xe2\x80\x99 lounge at the Boleyn Ground after a game. I don\xe2\x80\x99t really know how I came to be there but that is of little consequence, I guess. Anyway, I was playing run-outs in the bar with the other kids (mostly the children of legendary footballers such as Tommy McQueen and Garry Strodder) when in walked Wicksy of EastEnders fame (you may know him as Nick Berry). I promptly asked him for his autograph, being a truly famous person rather than a distinctly average football player and he just as promptly replied \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99. Being quite put out I went to tell my dad, who was stationed at the bar speaking with some permed blonde. The aforementioned blonde said \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not having that\xe2\x80\x99 and proceeded to march me back to Mr Berry and told him exactly what he thought of him. Needless to say my autograph book was signed, all thanks to the permed blonde from the bar. Thank you Frank McAvennie\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Grant Taylor.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI celebrated my 10th birthday at London\xe2\x80\x99s Planet Hollywood restaurant, and it soon transpired that a table close to ours was occupied by Paul Gascoigne and his long-suffering accomplice Jimmy Five Bellies. The pair didn\xe2\x80\x99t order any food but kept the waiter on his toes with drink orders (this was late 1993, around the time when Lazio implored him to address his dietary decisions). After Gazza merrily joined in with a rendition of Happy Birthday, I wondered over to his table to get an autograph. He happily obliged and then proceeded to thumb through a huge stack of cash that had been sitting on the table all evening. To my delight, he handed me \xc2\xa310 before sending me on my way. I probably spent it on Pogs\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ryan Bailey.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI once went to the gents in the Dog &amp; Fox on Wimbledon High Street and found my self standing next to former Wimbledon striker and father of the better known Jack, Alan Cork. I turned tippsily to him and said \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re Alan Cork?\xe2\x80\x99. He replied soberly: \xe2\x80\x98I might be\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Jason Steger. </p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cElie has never had a chip shop, to my knowledge (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters). St Monance yes, Pittenweem still and Anstruther several, one of them award-winning. Just saying, I was born there 53 years ago and still have family in The East Neuk of Fife as it\xe2\x80\x99s known, even though I moved away\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Grant Taylor.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
