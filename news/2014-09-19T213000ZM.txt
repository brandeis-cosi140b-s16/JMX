b'Manuel Pellegrini: Chelsea are one of many rivals for Manchester City'


b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini prefers to have a positive outlook and is therefore reluctant to speculate on the possibility of Chelsea doing what they did last year and winning at the Etihad. Should Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side manage it on Sunday they would open up an eight-point gap on their rivals with five games played and Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s defence of the title would be handicapped almost from the outset.</p> <p>The City manager admits Chelsea are likely to be important rivals this season, though not, he thinks, the only ones. \xe2\x80\x9cThere will be other teams involved in the race,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI can see Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham being in the fight but Jos\xc3\xa9 had a very strong squad last year and he has added some good players.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>One of those is Diego Costa, currently scoring goals for fun but, like Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero, kept on the sidelines for most of the Champions League game in midweek through an inability to play too often.</p> <p>Both former Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid strikers should face each other in the Premier League encounter, though fitness concerns mean their respective managers are having to use them sparingly. Costa cannot play three games in a week and Ag\xc3\xbcero, who missed a lot of last season and most of Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup, is having to be nursed gently back into action.</p> <p>What ought to be a showdown between the two most potent strikers in England \xe2\x80\x93 a reasonable billing now that Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez has departed and Radamel Falcao has yet to open his account at Manchester United \xe2\x80\x93 could come down to a question of which one is fit enough to last a full game.</p>           David Silva: Manchester City are going to give everything against Chelsea     <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPhysically, Sergio doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any problems at the moment,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe just needs match fitness. When he is 100% fit he will make a difference for us, I am sure about that. Both the times the club have won the title in the past few years goals from Sergio have made the difference.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOn one occasion it was two goals in three minutes. That is the kind of player that we have but I know Costa is a good player too. I knew what he did in Spain and I cannot say I am surprised about what he has been doing in England. Some players you just know will do well in the Premier League.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9c\xc3\x81lvaro Negredo was one, Costa is another. The football here suits the way they play, they like it here and that\xe2\x80\x99s why they can score goals from the start. But Chelsea are not just Diego Costa. You have to take care of Eden Hazard, Oscar, Willian and Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle. Maybe even Didier Drogba.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>For all that, Negredo is back in Spain and Stevan Jovetic is injured so, with only two fully fit strikers, one of whom is Ag\xc3\xbcero, Pellegrini does not have a great deal of back-up for the front line.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNegredo is injured, he would not be playing anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe still have the squad we need and Stevan will be fit next week.\xe2\x80\x9d Though hampered by Financial Fair Play restrictions in the summer Pellegrini still managed to spend \xc2\xa332m on a defender and it has not gone unnoticed that Eliaquim Mangala has yet to play a game.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe has not played since May,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy must we start with him immediately when we have two defenders [Vincent Kompany and Mart\xc3\xadn Demichelis] who are playing so well? We thought we needed a good young defender and we concluded Mangala was the correct player to sign but we did not necessarily sign him for the months of August and September. He is for the longer term. He will play when he is ready.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Bayern Munich\xe2\x80\x99s late winner on Wednesday in the Champions League means City picked up one point in their past three games \xe2\x80\x93 not exactly a flying start when Chelsea are unbeaten and have four wins out of four in the league but, as Pellegrini points out, the run of games was a difficult one. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had to play Arsenal and then Bayern away from home,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was not unhappy about either of our performances in those games. It was just the defeat by Stoke that was unusual. I had some complaints about the refereeing in the Arsenal game, but that is finished with now. I don\xe2\x80\x99t generally like to use referees as an excuse.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere was nothing wrong with the refereeing in the games against Stoke and Bayern. We just needed to play better. Maybe Bayern didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to win the way they did, with that goal in the last minute, but they had other chances and they played better than we did. We played well but we can improve on that and I believe we will in the games to come.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
