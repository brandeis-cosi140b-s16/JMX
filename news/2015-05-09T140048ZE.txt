b'<p>Relegation battles sometimes involve unlikely rescuers but rarely anyone quite this improbable. Centre-forwards should not be described as surprise scorers. When they are, it tends to combine criticism with mockery.</p> <p>Yet when Danny Graham\xe2\x80\x99s name rang around Goodison Park it was in praise and thanks. The enclave of Wearsiders celebrated a misfit who, in an instant, was transformed: the Newcastle fan turned Sunderland scorer. A lifeline came courtesy of one of the least lethal strikers in their history. Two and a half years after signing for Sunderland, 28 games into his Sunderland career, the much-maligned attacker finally found the net. So did a more regular, more reliable finisher in Jermain Defoe but Graham\xe2\x80\x99s was the pivotal contribution.</p> <p>Sunderland have had four managers in the time it has taken Graham to score a goal, but what a goal: not in its execution \xe2\x80\x93 frankly, he knew little about it \xe2\x80\x93 but in its importance. Sunderland, who acquired momentum in their final five games last season, may be timing their surge to safety perfectly again. They have recorded successive wins. Beat Leicester next Saturday and their task could be accomplished before the daunting end-of-season trips to Arsenal and Chelsea.</p> <p>From the rubble of a dreadful campaign, Sunderland have constructed their best run of the season. They have that heady cocktail of fortune and form. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were lucky,\xe2\x80\x9d said their manager, Dick Advocaat. Perhaps, after the dubious dismissal of Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s James Ward-Prowse at the Stadium of Light last week, it is becoming a theme. This time, Advocaat\xe2\x80\x99s charges struck twice, once in dubious circumstances, while barely recording an intentional shot on target. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything that could have gone against us in our box did,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Everton manager, Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez, who outlined his side\xe2\x80\x99s dominance in statistical terms. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had 22 attempts at goal, 15 corners and 75 percent of possession.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Advocaat did not attempt to sugar-coat victory. \xe2\x80\x9cEverton were the better side,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, excusing the \xe2\x80\x9cbrilliant\xe2\x80\x9d Lee Cattermole but accepting that Jordi G\xc3\xb3mez and Sebastian Larsson lost the midfield battle. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not a great game by our side but it was very effective and that is what counts. At some moments they outplayed us but our back five did really well, including the goalkeeper.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>At the end of an uneventful first half, Costel Pantilimon saved twice in succession when Everton scythed Sunderland open. When Leon Osman found Romelu Lukaku with a perceptive pass, Pantilimon came off his line to deny the Belgian. Ross Barkley set up a second opportunity for Osman seconds later but he repelled that, too. And when Phil Jagielka\xe2\x80\x99s header was bound for the top corner, Pantilimon clawed that away.</p> <p>Within five minutes, Sunderland led. G\xc3\xb3mez\xe2\x80\x99s long-range, wayward shot took a telling touch off the unwitting Graham\xe2\x80\x99s heel. His account was belatedly opened. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has been a frustrating couple of years at the football club,\xe2\x80\x9d said Graham, with masterly understatement. Industry had brought an unexpected reward.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe worked hard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Advocaat. There was method in the manager\xe2\x80\x99s apparent madness. While Graham\xe2\x80\x99s presence on the score sheet was unexpected, his status on the team sheet was more understandable. He acted as the selfless, isolated target while his 10 team-mates set up camp behind the ball.</p> <p>They even included Defoe, specialist predator reinvented as auxiliary right-back as he served as Billy Jones\xe2\x80\x99 unlikely shield. Yet once Everton trailed, Sunderland were afforded opportunities to counterattack. Four minutes after Graham scored, Patrick van Aanholt slalomed forward to almost add a second goal, with a skied shot following a searing burst. With five minutes to go, Defoe made the most of a rare foray into enemy territory.</p> <p>Graham\xe2\x80\x99s replacement Steven Fletcher embarked on a winding solo run, another substitute, Adam Johnson, shot and the ball bounced off Seamus Coleman to Defoe, who turned it in. \xe2\x80\x9cThe ball hits his arm before it goes in the net,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mart\xc3\xadnez who noted a second offence. \xe2\x80\x9cJohn Stones gets impeded by Fletcher,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cThe two goals are very unfortunate.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Everton manager\xe2\x80\x99s grievances with the referee, Lee Probert, included events in both boxes. \xe2\x80\x9cS\xc3\xa9amus Coleman is impeded by Defoe and it is clearly a penalty,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.</p> <p>The Spaniard\xe2\x80\x99s four-year spell at Wigan provided him with an MBA in escapology from relegation. He is aware the margins are narrow. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes the difference between staying up and not is the ball James McCarthy hits that hits the post,\xe2\x80\x9d Mart\xc3\xadnez said. The midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s 73rd-minute shot thudded back off the woodwork. Everton were denied an equaliser. Sunderland survived. It may prove a microcosm of the season.</p> <p>Instead, the goal came at the other end. Graham\xe2\x80\x99s replacement, Steven Fletcher, embarked on a winding solo run, another substitute, Adam Johnson, shot and the ball bounced off Coleman to Defoe, who turned it in. Perhaps he knew little about his finish either.</p>'
