b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini said it was vital to bounce back from Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s two consecutive defeats after the 2-0 win over West Ham United on Sunday, with further relief arriving when David Silva, carried off on a stretcher during the match, confirmed his injury was not serious.</p> <p>City\xe2\x80\x99s victory took the champions to 64 points and only one behind third-placed Manchester United, after Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s side\xe2\x80\x99s defeat at Chelsea on Saturday. The win also arrested a slump that has seen them fall from joint-top with Chelsea on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day to fourth position.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think it was very important for our team to win,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pellegrini. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was important to be a consistent team and we played especially well until the injury to David \xe2\x80\x93 that was a distraction. We are a consistent team. In other games we play minutes, today I think we played the whole game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Good news also came two hours after the game from Silva, who had been taken to hospital after a collision with Cheikhou Kouyat\xc3\xa9. \xe2\x80\x9cMany thanks to all the messages of support, all the tests have gone well and I\xe2\x80\x99m already home. The 3 points is what was important!, \xe2\x80\x9d he tweeted. The Spaniard had been carried off and needed an oxygen mask before going for x-rays.</p>'
