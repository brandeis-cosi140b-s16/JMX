b'Power rankings: Germans to the fore in 23-man Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or shortlist | Paul Doyle'


b'1 Cristiano Ronaldo <p>After years of going almost neck and neck with Lionel Messi, the Portuguese now stands head and mighty trapezius muscles above any other player in the world. He drove Real Madrid to the holy grail last season, leading the club\xe2\x80\x99s charge for their 10th European champions title, and he will probably have smashed the Champions League scoring records by the time the Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or is handed out, having already set historic scoring streaks in Spain this season. He has been relentlessly excellent. Injury hampered him at the World Cup but still his country\xe2\x80\x99s star</p> 2 Manuel Neuer <p>Not only does the 28-year-old excel at everything a goalkeeper is supposed to do well, he has redefined his position. Neuer\xe2\x80\x99s exceptional reading of the game and nimble feet enable him to act as an auxiliary sweeper and allow Bayern Munich and Germany to tighten their grip on opponents. Neuer conceded just 18 goals in 31 matches as Bayern won the Bundesliga in record time and dominated his country\xe2\x80\x99s rearguard as Germany won the World Cup for the first time in a generation</p> 3 Thomas M\xc3\xbcller <p>The Bayern Munich forward\xe2\x80\x99s shrewdness, strength and skill make him as hard to categorise as he is for defenders to contain. Able to influence matches from anywhere in midfield or across the front line, he has an uncanny ability to be in the right place at the right time and to make the right decisions. He scored eight goals in five matches as Bayern added the German Cup to their league title and won the silver boot at the World Cup</p> 4 Leo Messi <p>This was the year in which perhaps the best player of all time showed unprecedented signs of decline, meaning he was only brilliant. He was not helped by the fact that some of his Barcelona team-mates waned even more, which is why it was a year of relative underachievement for Messi even though he produced his finest World Cup performances (though he was subdued in the latter stages) and became the all-time leading scorer in El Cl\xc3\xa1sico thanks to a superb hat-trick against Real Madrid in March</p> 5 Philipp Lahm <p>The man that Pep Guardiola considers the cleverest player he has ever coached showed himself to be among the most influential midfielders on the planet while helping Bayern win the domestic double and confirmed his reputation as the best right-back around while captaining Germany to victory at the World Cup</p> 6 Neymar <p>At the age of 22 the Brazilian shouldered a burden of pressure that few players have ever endured at a World Cup and he did so with rare skill and infectious insouciance. He illuminated the tournament until he got injured, whereupon the hosts unravelled. After a difficult first season at Barcelona he evolved to become a worthy peer of Messi</p> 7 Thibault Courtois <p>The young Belgian demonstrated phenomenal talent and exceptional composure to help Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid to an unlikely Spanish title and to the final of the Champions League, withstanding unusual scrutiny to knock out his parent club, Chelsea, in the semi-final. Once his loan at Madrid expired, he returned to London, relegated the superb Petr Cech to the role of substitute and has helped give Chelsea renewed solidity</p> 8 Diego Costa <p>It was one of the biggest pities of the year that Diego Costa was not fully fit during the Champions League final or the World Cup. He had been outstanding before that, serving as a ferocious one-man forward line for Atl\xc3\xa9tico before moving to the Premier League and solving Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s striker problem</p> 9 Arjen Robben <p>The Dutchman may hit the floor faster than a juiced-up disco dancer but he also uplifts matches in a way few others can. In an era of football technocracy, he can shatter any system with his explosive dribbling and shooting. Bayern Munich would not be so dominant without him and Holland would not have made the semi-finals of the World Cup either</p> 10 Toni Kroos <p>The German has further embellished his reputation as the ultimate modern playmaker, combining huge dynamism with rare vision and almost flawless passing precision. Some questioned how he would fit in to Real Madrid following his move from Bayern Munich in the wake of his triumphant World Cup, but he has already made his new team more fluent</p> 11 Zlatan Ibrahimovic <p>One of the most sorely-missed absentees from the World Cup, the Swede was the second-highest scorer in last season\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League and struck 10 goals more than anyone else in Ligue 1 as Paris\xc2\xa0Saint-Germain romped to the title in France</p> 12 James Rodr\xc3\xadguez <p>The Colombian went to the World Cup on the back of a club season in which he finished as the leading assist-provider in Ligue 1. He continued to display wonderful creativity in Brazil and also finished moves, winning the Golden Boot at the tournament. That was enough to persuade Real Madrid to buy him for nearly twice the \xe2\x82\xac45m fee that Monaco had paid Porto for him the year before</p> 13 Bastian Schweinsteiger <p>Injury meant the midfielder was not always available but he still featured enough for Bayern and Germany to serve as the smooth engine in their midfields as both teams enjoyed great success</p> 14 Angel di Mar\xc3\xada <p>The waifish winger spent 2014 wreaking havoc on opposing defences. With his speed, trickery and exquisite crossing, he was the leading provider of assists in La Liga and the Champions League. He shone at the World Cup until injury cut him down in the quarter-final. That left Argentinians aghast and Real players and fans shared that feeling when the Spaniards sold him to Manchester United, where he has been the outstanding player of the season so far</p> 15 Gareth Bale <p>The Welshman wore the \xe2\x80\x98world\xe2\x80\x99s most expensive player\xe2\x80\x99 tag with casual elan. It was not just his carefully-honed physique that made him look tailor-made for Real Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League-winning team, but also his elegant explosiveness and game-breaking skill. His goal in the Champions League final was fitting reward for a fine first season at Real and he has helped ignite hope that Wales will soon earn a place in the international spotlight too</p> 16 Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 <p>Few players have ever dominated Premier League midfields the way that Tour\xc3\xa9 did in Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s triumphant 2013-14 campaign. With a unique blend of power and finesse he plundered 20 league goals as City held off a Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez-inspired Liverpool. The Ivorian would surely appear higher in the rankings if he had been able to help City go farther in the Champions League and if injury and bereavement had not complicated his World Cup</p> 17 Javier Mascherano <p>A diligent defender for Barcelona, the Argentinian was one of the outstanding performers at the World Cup, providing the solidity and drive that enabled his team\xe2\x80\x99s more glamorous players to thrive. He exemplified the extent to which he was the heart and brains of his team by tearing his anus while making a last-minute, goal-saving tackle on Arjen Robben</p> 18 Paul Pogba <p>Manchester United fans must have felt like those game-show losers who are shown \xe2\x80\x9cand here\xe2\x80\x99s what you could have won\xe2\x80\x9d, as the player whom Sir Alex Ferguson could not persuade to stay at Old Trafford drove Juventus to the Serie A title. Voted Fifa\xe2\x80\x99s best young player of the year for 2014, the Frenchman showed both for his club and country that he is among the most potent all-round midfielders on the planet</p> 19 Mario G\xc3\xb6tze <p>Following his acrimonious move from Borussia Dortmund to Bayern Munich the youngster did not quite find consistency but he did show flashes of refined skill and intelligence, most obviously when volleying the winning goal in the World Cup final</p> 20 Karim Benzema <p>After ending a mammoth barren streak for France, the striker finally began to convince his compatriots that he was not wasting his potential and he contributed to a decent World Cup showing by his country. For his club, he dovetailed swiftly and smartly with Ronaldo, Bale &amp; co</p> 21 Eden Hazard <p>After Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho demanded he be more focused and decisive, the Belgian showcased his magical dribbling and defence-busting passing with greater regularity than ever this year. If he could add more goals to his game, especially for his country, than he would surely elevate himself to the highest level</p> 22 Andr\xc3\xa9s Iniesta <p>A sub-par year by his standards, but Iniesta remained one of the most deftly dangerous midfielders on the planet. His control is such that the ball seems part of his anatomy. German technik may have overtaken tika-taka, but really only time could diminish Iniesta\xe2\x80\x99s influence</p> 23 Sergio Ramos <p>If red cards sometimes make him a liability his excellent defending usually makes up for it, and last season he added another skill to his repertoire, becoming a scorer of crucial goals. He netted twice in the Champions League semi-final win against Bayern Munich and a late equaliser to force the final to extra time. He played with a different central defensive partner in each of Spain\xe2\x80\x99s matches during their World Cup flop</p>'
