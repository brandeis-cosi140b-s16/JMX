b'Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s Gus Poyet: I almost took off matchwinner Adam Johnson'


b'<p>Gus Poyet admitted he was seconds away from substituting Adam Johnson during the second half of Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s Tyne-Wear derby at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park but underwent a last-ditch change of heart and watched the winger score the 90th-minute winner.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI have to be honest, I was going to take Adam off but, for some reason, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t and he went on to score the winning goal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s manager. His side\xe2\x80\x99s 1-0 victory was their fourth in a row against Newcastle and third in succession on Tyneside but the Uruguayan acknowledged it could have been very different had he followed his initial 81st-minute instinct. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had Adam\xe2\x80\x99s number ready on the board for it to go up,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I said to my bench: \xe2\x80\x98No, make it No10. Make it Connor [Wickham] instead.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent goal means the former England winger has scored in each of his team\xe2\x80\x99s victories at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park. \xe2\x80\x9cThree years in a row,\xe2\x80\x9d said Johnson. \xe2\x80\x9cThey must hate me here.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>On an afternoon notable for the sort of off-pitch peace and understanding which in recent seasons has been conspicuously absent from often violent north-east derbies both sets of supporters paid tribute to the Newcastle fans who died in July\xe2\x80\x99s flight MH17 tragedy over eastern Ukraine. Pardew praised the attitude of Sunderland supporters but was left \xe2\x80\x9churt\xe2\x80\x9d by becoming the first Newcastle manager to lose four successive derbies and also suffering his fifth defeat against Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s teams, with the first two being inflicted by Brighton in the FA Cup.</p> <p>Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s manager was more concerned about his successes with his new employers. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a special moment for us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s great. It will make a very special Christmas. I think we were better in terms of creating clear-cut chances.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He accepted that Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s decision to throw caution to the wind and opt for a late attacking onslaught played into his hands, prompting Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s winner on the counterattack. \xe2\x80\x9cAlan put on all his strikers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poyet, for whom this was only a third Premier League victory of the season. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a very, very brave move and it nearly paid off but in almost one action Costel Pantilimon saved in the top corner and then Adam scored.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>After this Pardew could probably do without a Boxing Day trip to Manchester United. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s painful,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter a first half in which we got wrapped up in emotion and gave too many fouls away we started to create chances and gave them problems. But then we over-committed.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Not that he was apologising for such attacking substitutions. \xe2\x80\x9cThis club wants to see goals,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m never going to be manager of Newcastle United and accept a home draw as a positive result, whoever the opposition is. I still expected my defenders to do their job but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to criticise anyone.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe tried to win the game. If we\xe2\x80\x99re ever going to lose, I want us to lose in this manner.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9c There were great performances from both teams, it was one of the better derbies. My players have given everything but sometimes you don\xe2\x80\x99t get your just rewards. To a great extent it was a really good performance but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t our day. To lose is very disappointing but we\xe2\x80\x99re still in a healthy place in the league and we have to build on it. It hurts but we have to lick our wounds and prepare for Manchester United.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>If Sir Bobby Robson was looking down on St James\xe2\x80\x99 from above, the former Newcastle manager will not have been surprised. Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s habit of scoring vital goals against the Tynesiders for both Chelsea and Tottenham prompted Robson to dub him \xe2\x80\x9cthe scourge of Newcastle\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Even Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s coach seems perplexed by this extraordinary effect. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t explain it. It\xe2\x80\x99s unexplainable.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
