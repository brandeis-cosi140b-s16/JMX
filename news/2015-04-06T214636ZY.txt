b'Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s screamer for Manchester City fails to mask inconsistency | James Riach'


b'<p>It was on this ground last season that Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 produced a majestic piece of quality. During a year of countless highs, the midfielder glided forward down the right wing, receiving the ball in the Crystal Palace penalty area having set off from the halfway line following a one-two, and proceeded to loop the ball calmly over Juli\xc3\xa1n Speroni.</p> <p>It proved to be a crucial effort on a pivotal day of the campaign. City\xe2\x80\x99s 2-0 victory here 12 months ago propelled them back into the ascendancy in the title race, on the same afternoon as Steven Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s untimely slip against Chelsea punctured the momentum for Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 side.</p> <p>In the end, it was a day that turned the tide in City\xe2\x80\x99s favour and they ended the season on top after a thrilling finish. Liverpool, who had appeared well set for a first title in 24 years, were hit with a sucker punch that day and Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s side \xe2\x80\x93 courtesy of Tour\xc3\xa9 and Edin Dzeko \xe2\x80\x93 took full advantage.</p> <p>The Ivorian returned to the team here on Monday night after missing the recent victory over West Bromwich Albion with an achilles injury, and produced another fine piece of magic. A year on from that game-changer last season, though, and it is all but over for City in the Premier League.</p> <p>When Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s strike came, it was too little too late for City. His left-footed effort in the 78th minute was not enough for Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s side, a piece of brilliance that came like a bolt from the blue with his team two goals down.</p> <p>Perhaps this year has demonstrated how much Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s side rely on their star midfielder to shine when the chips are down. Tour\xc3\xa9 was far from at his best here yet his strike soared past Speroni to set up a tense finish. How City could have done with more such moments this season.</p>           Manuel Pellegrini denies his job is on the line after losing to Crystal Palace.    <p>Tour\xc3\xa9 scored 20 Premier League goals \xe2\x80\x93 not to mention a wonderful effort in the Capital One Cup final \xe2\x80\x93 throughout the course of last season, a phenomenal record and one that dragged City out of difficult situations on numerous occasions. Yet he has certainly not hit his former heights this year, a campaign that will surely be remembered as one that never really got going.</p> <p>Much like Manchester City, there have been periods of dominance but the consistent level set previously has been absent. Usually the adage rings true that when Tour\xc3\xa9 plays well, City play well.</p> <p>The 31-year-old enjoyed a purple patch through November and December \xe2\x80\x93 scoring six goals in eight games \xe2\x80\x93 but the Africa Cup of Nations interrupted that fine run. He played an important role in Ivory Coast\xe2\x80\x99s success in Equatorial Guinea but, since his return, Tour\xc3\xa9 has not been able to inspire City to challenge Chelsea sufficiently at the summit of the Premier League.</p> <p>It is difficult to pinpoint why Tour\xc3\xa9 has not hit the level of last season. In many ways a repeat of 2013-14 was always unlikely, given the remarkable performances he made time and again, yet things have never seemed the same at City ever since the row over his birthday last May.</p> <p>Back then, Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s agent, Dimitri Seluk, claimed the player was \xe2\x80\x9cvery upset\xe2\x80\x9d at a lack of respect shown by City when he turned 31, words that prompted a bizarre few weeks amid claims and counter-claims that did not paint anyone involved in much glory.</p> <p>Whenever he was on the ball here, there remained the constant threat of danger, although there were a few wayward shots. In the fifth minute he was almost fed in one-on-one by David Silva were it not for a crucial, late interception, and he was denied on the line midway through the half.</p> <p>Tour\xc3\xa9 struck an effort high and wide shortly before half-time, as Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s men trudged off behind at the interval. Things soon went from bad to worse, with their title chances \xe2\x80\x93 and even their chances of a top-three finish \xe2\x80\x93 dealt a major blow when Jason Puncheon added to Glenn Murray\xe2\x80\x99s opener.</p> <p>Once Puncheon had put Palace 2-0 up, City increased the pressure. Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero drove down the right and had a low drive blocked, before the ball reached Jes\xc3\xbas Navas. The Spaniard laid it back for Tour\xc3\xa9 on the edge of the area but his first-time effort flew well over the crossbar to his obvious frustration.</p> <p>He came much close minutes later, curling a central free-kick onto the roof of the net from 25 yards out. Speroni was scrambling but, not for the only time during this game, Palace rode their luck. Tour\xc3\xa9 did eventually find a way past the goalkeeper but it ended up being a miserable evening for City.</p>'
