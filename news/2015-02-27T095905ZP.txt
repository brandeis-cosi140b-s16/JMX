b'Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend | Toby Moses and Nick Miller'


b'1) A Giroud awakening <p>Nobody has ever claimed Olivier Giroud was a world-class striker. His is not a name one would mention alongside Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero, Diego Costa or Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez. He is a rung below that \xe2\x80\x93 always has been, always will be \xe2\x80\x93 consistently scoring, but never likely to scorch his way through the division. And when you spend \xc2\xa313m on a striker it would be unfair to expect any more. The days of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger plucking a Thierry Henry from the doldrums and transforming him in to a world beater are long gone \xe2\x80\x93 and when he brought in Giroud to replace Robin van Persie in 2012 he acknowledged as much. The Frenchman did not arrive alone \xe2\x80\x93 Lukas Podolski also pitched up that summer, their combined fees about the same as the amount Manchester United paid for the Dutchman. Two strikers to replace one world-class departure. None of this is to excuse the series of woeful misses on Wednesday night which condemned Arsenal to one of their more humiliating Champions League defeats. Yes, the defence was poor, and the concession of the third goal having just clawed their way back into the tie was inexcusable, but had Giroud scored the hat-trick of chances presented to him then the match would have turned out rather differently. It was an unusual, and sad sight, to see the big striker lumber off after 60 mintues \xe2\x80\x93 it is not often Wenger replaces a player for a poor performance, even more unsual that early in a game. But what now? If Giroud does not lead the line against Everton on Sunday then who will? Podolski is out on loan (and how Arsenal could have done with someone with his finishing ability against Monaco), Joel Campbell and Yaya Sanogo likewise. Danny Welbeck has not convinced when leading the line, Theo Walcott looks short of confidence and fitness, and Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez seems knackered by the relentless season he has had. Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s form has undoubtedly improved since Giroud returned to the team \xe2\x80\x93 he provides a pivot around which the likes of Cazorla, \xc3\x96zil, S\xc3\xa1nchez, Welbeck and Walcott can rotate \xe2\x80\x93 someone to bounce balls off of and make runs. If they are to keep their campaign for third on track (so as to qualify for next season\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League and another last-16 exit) then Giroud will need to rediscover his confidence, and his scoring touch, very quickly indeed. Toby Moses</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Barney Ronay: Giroud turns into a wandering wardrobe</p> 2) Can Everton solve their Europa blues? <p>Everton\xe2\x80\x99s problems this season have been wide and varied, from a regression in their defensive solidity, to Romelu Lukaku\xe2\x80\x99s sometimes erratic form (perhaps brought about by him being worked into the ground), to Ross Barkley not progressing as many thought/hoped he might. However one simple and fairly identifiable issue has been their form in games immediately after Europa League ties \xe2\x80\x93 they have won just two of the seven games following their European excursions, and they against Burnley and Queens Park Rangers, hardly the sternest of tests the Premier League fixture list can throw up. Plenty of sides have struggled with the Thursday/Sunday combination but it has added to Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s already lengthy list of issues this season, and while Arsenal away is not exactly the most straightforward task on Sunday, the Gunners will be dealing with their own woes after their Champions League defeat on Wednesday. This could be a good chance for Everton to set this particular problem right. Nick Miller</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Sport Network: League Cup finals of the 1980s</p> 3) Robin van Persie\xe2\x80\x99s absence could be a benefit for Manchester United <p>This season has been a big improvement for Manchester United. Well, as long as you have not actually watched them play, of course. But still, they are three places and five points better off than they were at this stage last term, and that\xe2\x80\x99s worth \xc2\xa3150million, right? Of course, that is being facetious, because Louis van Gaal did not take over a team that had just won the league, rather one with confidence at, to say the least, something of a low ebb following David Moyes\xe2\x80\x99s tenure, but Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s time in charge has not exactly been flawless.</p> <p>One of the big strikes against the Dutchman has been that it has often looked like he has tried to shoehorn his countryman Robin van Persie into the team when his form has barely justified such an automatic selection, and while the alternatives (the disappointing/injured Radamel Falcao, the green James Wilson and the not-a-centre-forward Wayne Rooney) are not exactly hugely appealing, that does not mean Van Persie should be the first name on the teamsheet. Van Persie has scored twice in 2015 (in nine starts), one of which was against last-placed Leicester, the other a penalty against Burnley \xe2\x80\x93 not a return to get especially excited about. Thus, it could be a positive for United that Van Persie has been ruled out (possibly for a month) with an ankle problem, forcing Van Gaal to confront life without his favourite. One of United\xe2\x80\x99s big problems has been a lack of pace in attack (or anywhere, really), and the young Wilson at least has that, and while a goal or two against Sunderland on Saturday is perhaps unlikely to provide startling evidence for his continued inclusion, he could at least show the manager that there is life beyond Van Persie. Nick Miller</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Tyler Blackett signs two-year contract extension</p> 4) Southampton dreamers could face wake-up call from belligerent Baggies <p>After a disappointing defeat to Liverpool, Southampton need to prove that their season is not going to fade away in the manner many a pundit has predicted. With Arsenal and Liverpool both facing tough matches, Tottenham occupied by the League Cup final, and Manchester United consistently inconsistent a win on Saturday may lift them back in to the top four, and create some distance on those below them in the table. However, Tony Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s familiarly dogged West Brom are unlikely to be acquiescent hosts. Since taking over at the Hawthorns, Pulis has lost just one game \xe2\x80\x93a limp defeat to a Harry Kane-inspired Spurs \xe2\x80\x93 and has started to build a sturdy defence, comparable to that at previous clubs Crystal Palace and Stoke. How other relegation threatened sides \xe2\x80\x93 Aston Villa, perhaps? \xe2\x80\x93 must wish they had taken a punt on Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s brand of managerial rescue act. As it is the Baggies are on course to retain their top-flight status, and will provide a stern test to Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s European ambitions. Toby Moses</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Southampton steward body-slams Liverpool fan</p> 5) How will Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s defence cope with City\xe2\x80\x99s attack? <p>Statistics are weird, sometimes. For example, after not being breached by Southampton last weekend Simon Mignolet, the man who earlier in the season was deemed an inferior goalkeeper to Brad Jones, took the lead in the clean sheets charts. Weird. While it might seem cruel to remove some of the credit from the Belgian, Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s run of defensive frugality has neatly coincided with the Liverpool manager, Brendan Rodgers, introducing a new defensive system, the three-at-the-back approach apparently working quite nicely, even when one of those three has been a midfielder and another Dejan Lovren. Still, a good portion of those clean sheets have come against teams whose attacks one could charitably describe as \xe2\x80\x98less than potent\xe2\x80\x99 (Sunderland, Aston Villa etc), but it would be a struggle to level that charge against Manchester City. The attacking options Manuel Pellegrini now has available to him are enough to make any defence reach for a nerve-steadying stiff drink, not least with Wilfried Bony now in the mix. While Liverpool have come through some tricky encounters in the last couple of months, their new-look defence facing Ag\xc3\xbcero, Silva, Tour\xc3\xa9 et al on Sunday will be the toughest yet.

Villa are obviously in need of a reemphasis on attack after the turgid years under Paul Lambert \xe2\x80\x93 but Sherwood\xe2\x80\x99s gung-ho instincts may not work quite as well in the Midlands as they did at Tottenham \xe2\x80\x93 where he could draw upon a wealth of attacking talent and Premier League knowhow. A trip to St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park on Saturday is not an ideal followup to get his reign back on track either. Newcastle have lost just three at home in the league all season \xe2\x80\x93 to Sunderland, Manchester City and Southampton \xe2\x80\x93 but their form under John Carver has been woeful, a solitary win at Hull City. The Magpies may look safe in midtable \xe2\x80\x93 but with games against Manchester United, Everton and Arsenal in March, they need a result to ensure that a string of good results from the likes of Aston Villa, Burnley and QPR do not drag them into a dogfight. Sherwood will be under pressure until he can back up his evident passion with some cold, hard results, but Carver \xe2\x80\x93 a man nobody but the ever-frugal Mike Ashley seemed too keen on to succeed Alan Pardew \xe2\x80\x93 has as much to worry about this weekend. Toby Moses</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s Jon\xc3\xa1s Guti\xc3\xa9rrez returns to squad after testicular cancer</p> 7) England\xe2\x80\x99s Noble cause <p>It is rather strange that the team that lost to a North London side at home last weekend is probably feeling rather more positive about the result than the team that managed a draw against the other North London crew away. While Alan Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s Crystal Palace side, who visit Upton Park on Saturday, were hugely unlucky not to square it up at the death against Arsenal, West Ham capitulated horribly at White Hart Lane, with the withdrawal of Mark Noble after his lucky escape from a red card followed by two Spurs goals (one of which came from Alex Song\xe2\x80\x99s idiotic concession of a last-minute penalty). If ever evidence was needed of Noble\xe2\x80\x99s importance to Sam Allardyce\xe2\x80\x99s side this was it. A rare one-club man, Noble has signed another contract extension in East London, sure to delight the faithful, which will allow him to lead the rejuvenated Hammers into their new ground at the Olympic Stadium. In his prime at 27, Noble was capped at every youth level for England but is still yet to earn a full cap. The central midfield area is fairly well stocked, with Jack Wilshere, Jordan Henderson and Ross Barkley all fairly secure, but could the England manager, Roy Hodgson, not do with a bit of old-fashioned English drive at the base of the midfield to free up the more technically gifted colleagues to do their thing? In much the same way as Scott Parker managed to nail down a place in the national team when at West Ham, Noble has matured and seems ready for a challenge at a higher level that he is unlikely to experience with West Ham, unless they can recapture that early-season form. It would also give a much-needed hint to young English talent at less-glamorous clubs that they needn\xe2\x80\x99t depart for pastures new in order to fulfil international ambitions. Too many \xe2\x80\x93 Scott Sinclair, Jack Rodwell et al \xe2\x80\x93 have wasted important years on the bench at big clubs. Noble may walk a disciplinary tightrope at times \xe2\x80\x93 as witnessed last weekend \xe2\x80\x93 but his form over the past season is surely worthy of a try when England take on Lithuania and Italy at the end of March. Toby Moses</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Mark Noble signs new West Ham United deal to tie him to club until 2020</p> 8) Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s Cup exit was no capital gain for Nigel Pearson <p>When Nigel Pearson saw his Leicester side dumped out of the Capital One Cup in late August by Shrewsbury he was unlikely to have been too concerned. An unnecessary distraction to Premier League survival was swiftly dealt with, and it was followed by a reassuring draw against Arsenal, a victory at Stoke, and that result against Manchester United. Everything looked spiffy on the good ship Pearson. Spool forward six months and the League Cup looks like it may be Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s undoing in a most unexpected fashion. With Tottenham taking on Chelsea in the final on Sunday, Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s match this weekend has been postponed, and they face the prospect of Aston Villa and Burnley, both with winnable games, taking a seven-point lead over them. As encouraging as recent performances from Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s men have been, seven points at this point of the season is a lot \xe2\x80\x93 even with a game in hand. The squad, and their manager, will no doubt be enjoying a spot of R&amp;R as well as training this week, but come Saturday all eyes will be on Sky Sports, with the hope that results around the country still leave them with a chance of retaining their Premier League status. Toby Moses</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Nigel Pearson - The Gallery</p> 9) Swansea need to be consistently more consistent <p>It must be a challenge to be churlish as a Swansea fan, these days. All but the very youngest will remember a time when they were at the foot of the entire Football League, so a fourth season of comfortable top-flight presence is tough to complain about. And yet, and yet, and yet. Now they are an established Premier League side, so sights should be higher, expectations recalibrated etc, and therefore their inconsistency this season must be a frustration. Swansea started the season with three straight victories, but since then they have only managed two wins in a row (and that is in all competitions) once, and their longest unbeaten league run is three games. The thing is, with a bit of consistency they could make more of an impression on the table, instead of sitting in eighth or ninth, where they have been since the start of December. The Swans\xe2\x80\x99 players have talked about a different approach from Garry Monk, making them more solid defensively which at least in part helped them to their 2-1 win over Manchester United last weekend, but also suggests they could bring that consistency into their game. A win over Burnley on Saturday would be a decent first step towards that.

And on the early evidence, it is easy to see why, with N\xe2\x80\x99Doye scoring two goals already, one being the vital late winner against QPR last weekend. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had to work extremely hard to get him but he has now got two in two games, and that could just be the difference,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruce after the QPR game, and with the rest of Hull\xe2\x80\x99s forward line being fairly unreliable, in a number of respects, his words certainly ring true. Of course N\xe2\x80\x99Doye does not have to continue his current rate to help his team stay in the division, but a few well-placed goals in some well-placed games \xe2\x80\x93 like against Stoke on Saturday, for example \xe2\x80\x93 should provide enough points to keep them out of trouble. If so, it would be the signing of the season. Nick Miller</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Hull could face FFP sanctions</p>'
