b'<p>Vincent Kompany may not play again this season for Manchester City with Manuel Pellegrini unsure how long the captain will be ruled out for.</p> <p>Wilfried Bony, Ga\xc3\xabl Clichy, Stevan Jovetic and James Milner will also miss Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s visit of West Ham United.</p> <p>The captain and central defender suffered the injury during Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 4-2 derby defeat at Manchester United and was taken off at half-time.</p> <p>Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cHe has a muscle injury \xe2\x80\x93 we don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he will be fit before the end of the season.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of his other injured players, the manager said: \xe2\x80\x9cJovetic, Bony, Clichy, Milner and Kompany are not fit for Sunday. [Dedryck] Boyata is fit \xe2\x80\x93 he started working yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini also defended Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9, whose uneven form has drawn unwelcome attention. \xe2\x80\x9cYaya is a very important player for our team. All of you are waiting for me to criticise him but he will continue.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>City\xe2\x80\x99s form has slumped since New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, when they were joint top with Chelsea, to stand fourth. Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s more important than ever to have the fans, the players and the staff together as one. We are one club.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Asked if this was his most difficult spell since becoming manager, Pellegrini admitted it was his \xe2\x80\x9cworst\xe2\x80\x9d. He said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the worst period in results because we lost the last four games we play away in Premier League and 2015 has been a very bad year.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLast year was more pressure when I arrive to the PL and we were fighting for the title.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Asked if he was hurt to hear other managers linked with his job, the Chilean said: \xe2\x80\x9cEvery time you manage an important club, not just here in Manchester City, in every big club, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have the results the club deserves, everyone is talking to change the manager. Here, in Spain, in Italy, in other parts of the world so you must be used to the rumours but I trust a lot in the work I do.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOf course nobody is happy when you are out of the fight for the title. Maybe you cannot win the title every year but it is very easy to sack the manager. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is the correct diagnostic for every team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
