b'<p> Arsenal have opened talks with Theo Walcott in a bid to extend his stay at the Emirates beyond the end of next season.</p> <p>Walcott, who ruptured a cruciate ligament in the FA Cup tie against Tottenham Hotspur in January, returned to the Arsenal team as a substitute in Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s 3-0 success over Burnley and is expected to start on the bench once more against Anderlecht on Tuesday. His deal expires in the summer of 2016 and the club are keen to secure his services for the peak years of his career, acutely aware negotiations proved somewhat tortuous last time around.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe are starting to sit down with him,\xe2\x80\x9d Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger said of the player signed from Southampton in January 2006. \xe2\x80\x9cI think he has one and a half years to go in December. It is never an easy job with him. These should be his peak years because he is 25 now. He\xe2\x80\x99s into his best years, so hopefully we can profit from that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Arsenal are starting talks slightly early, despite the winger\xe2\x80\x99s injury problems, given that discussions over his present deal dragged on before he signed a three-and-a-half-year contract in January 2013 worth \xc2\xa3100,000 a week, including image rights and a \xc2\xa33m loyalty bonus. His previous deal had been worth nearer \xc2\xa355,000 a week and had entered its final six months. The player and his agent had been seeking terms to reflect his value on the pitch as well as in marketing, given his popularity \xe2\x80\x93 not least in east Asia, where the club are seeking to make commercial inroads.</p> <p>An offer approaching \xc2\xa380,000 a week had been rejected in August 2012, souring relations, and Wenger dropped him from the starting lineup for more than two months. Chelsea and Manchester City considered moves for his services at the time. He returned to the team with a forward\xe2\x80\x99s brief and his 14 goals in all competitions ultimately ensured his push for significantly improved terms was successful. Arsenal will hope the new negotiations are more straightforward.</p> <p>Wenger would encourage England to select the winger for this month\xe2\x80\x99s internationals against Slovenia and Scotland to ensure he continues to build up match sharpness after nine months out of the side. \xe2\x80\x9cTheo is a unique player,\xe2\x80\x9d the Arsenal captain, Mikel Arteta, said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a player who has been here for a long time, and someone who gives us something very different. He has been tremendous for us in the last few seasons, so to get a player like him back after such a long time can only be a positive for us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
