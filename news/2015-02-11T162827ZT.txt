b'<p>LET THEM EAT CAKE pt.II</p> <p>The Premier League: it\xe2\x80\x99s the best league in the world! Except it\xe2\x80\x99s not, is it. Let\xe2\x80\x99s set aside any debate over how good the (shivers, spits, dry heaves) product is, which wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be much of an argument anyway, seeing Chelsea are walking one of the most boring title races in history yet can\xe2\x80\x99t even cope with visits from Bradford City in the cup without touching ventilated climacool\xc2\xae cloth, or that the Scottish league, the Scottish league, is far less predictable right at this minute. No, The Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s disdain is mainly reserved for the abject manner in which things are run off the pitch. What a miserable business it is.</p> <p>Or, more to the point, what misers run the business. These people are far from financially inept: hats off to them for brokering a record \xc2\xa35,140,000,000 deal with Sky Television and the Post Office Telecommunications Channel for the rights to show more not-quite-as-good-as-the-third-division skill and sub-Caledonian drama until 2019! Well done, everyone! But oh, the humanity! When the chief executive of the Premier League, equality\xe2\x80\x99s Richard Scudamore, was today asked whether the deal made him uncomfortable, given players are paid millions while 19 of the 20 clubs refuse to pay the UK Living Wage to the kind of folk who cook Richard\xe2\x80\x99s dinner, serve Richard\xe2\x80\x99s gin and tonic, sweep away Richard\xe2\x80\x99s litter, and clean around the rim of the diamond-encrusted fittings in Richard\xe2\x80\x99s executive bathroom, he replied with a haughty sniff: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make me uncomfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Marie Antoinette of football administration explained his well-upholstered position with a brazen non-sequitur. \xe2\x80\x9cThe reality is,\xe2\x80\x9d he brayed, \xe2\x80\x9cjust like in the film industry, in the pop industry, the talent, the absolute talent, gets paid a disproportionately high amount.\xe2\x80\x9d A valid viewpoint, even though nobody\xe2\x80\x99s been asking for the tea lady to trouser the same salary as \xc3\x81ngel Di Mar\xc3\xada, just that she gets an extra \xc2\xa31.35 an hour and can thus hopefully avoid a life of Just Scraping By. Scudamore then trotted out another tired old trope of lazy entitlement: \xe2\x80\x9cAt the end of the day there\xe2\x80\x99s a thing called the Living Wage but there\xe2\x80\x99s also a Minimum Wage, and politicians do have the power to up that Minimum Wage. That\xe2\x80\x99s entirely for the politicians to do, that\xe2\x80\x99s not for us to do.\xe2\x80\x9d </p> <p>Another valid viewpoint, albeit one from a man who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had to rummage around for coins to buy a loaf of bread a couple of days before pay-day any time recently. It\xe2\x80\x99s also rather undermined by the fact that the one Premier League club to have happily agreed to meet the Living Wage is Chelsea. And they\xe2\x80\x99re easy with coughing up the additional London weighting of \xc2\xa31.30 an hour to boot! When you\xe2\x80\x99re outflanked on the left by renowned pinko liberal Roman Abramovich, as well as bolshie socialist Boris Johnson and communist institutions such as Barclays Bank and Nestl\xc3\xa9, perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s time to have a little rethink about the way you view the world.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Paul Doyle at 7.45pm GMT for MBM coverage of Chelsea 2-1 Everton, while Alan Smith will be on hand with a Premier League clockwatch and Scott Murray will be hot-seating his way through Barcelona 1-1 Villarreal in the Copa del Rey.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is an amazing amount of money. In one way it is positive for the teams, but I think it is pretty negative for the future of international football for England\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Lord Sugar, there, bemoaning the Sky/BT deal. That\xe2\x80\x99s the same Lord Sugar who, in 1991, bought Spurs at the behest of Rupert Murdoch, to ensure Robert Maxwell, a confidant of free-to-air ITV, didn\xe2\x80\x99t get his hands on the club. The same Lord Sugar who as the new Spurs chairman contacted Sky during the 1992 TV talks to inform them they\xe2\x80\x99d been outbid by free-to-air ITV, and that they\xe2\x80\x99d better get a revised bid in double-quick. And the same Lord Sugar who made a few pennies here and there by selling Amstrad dishes to Sky. Come on England! We\xe2\x80\x99re all right behind ya!</p>      PROBABLY THE LAST OF YOUR MUNDANE ENCOUNTERS WITH FAMOUS PEOPLE \xe2\x80\xa6 <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I first moved to New York some years ago I found myself working in a fancy designer clothing store. One day in walked leggy supermodel Linda Evangelista followed by a not-so-leggy Fabian Barthez. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t let on that I knew he was a famous goalie until she threw something at him and he dropped it. \xe2\x80\x98Manchester United,\xe2\x80\x99 I said.\xe2\x80\x98I know!\xe2\x80\x99 she said. \xe2\x80\x98And he can\xe2\x80\x99t even catch.\xe2\x80\x99 To be fair they were both a bit merry\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 D Lynch.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs a wee seven-year-old living in the shadows of Old Trafford, my dad had taken me fishing on the Bridgewater Canal. As usual, he was annoyed I was managing to fill the keep net at a considerably faster rate than he was, when the shout came to pull our equipment in due to an oncoming barge. This was nothing out of the ordinary, what with it being a busy waterway, but the individual and his menagerie of passengers was, given it was Eric Cantona and what I assumed was his family. I looked at him, he glared at me before I squeaked out an inaudible \xe2\x80\x98hello\xe2\x80\x99, to which Eric returned with a gruff \xe2\x80\x98bonjour\xe2\x80\x99. It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a better story than the time I neighboured Anderson in the urinals at a charity event at said stadium\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Scott Lloyd.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn 1976 I was on my sandwich year, working in the reception of Novotel Marseille Aeroport. In those days it was still the law, usually ignored, for every guest to complete a little form on arrival and these were handed over to the police on an irregular basis. Imagine my joy when Alf Ramsey came through the door one day, surrounded by a lot of football players. I knew they were football players because one of them was Peter Osgood. Relying on their ignorance of common practice, I made every single one of them complete the form, then stole them to give to my brother. I have always assumed, because of the aforementioned Messrs Ramsey and Osgood \xe2\x80\x93 the only two I recognised \xe2\x80\x93 that this was the England team; but on doing my homework 38 and a half years later, I find they must have been the Southampton team, on their way to losing to Marseille in the second leg of their European Cup Winners\xe2\x80\x99 Cup tie (Saints won 5-2 on aggregate and eventually lost to Anderlecht in the quarter-finals). I feel sure they were all very flattered to be mistaken for the England team, and I now understand why my brother, a lifelong West Ham supporter, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as impressed at my daring as I thought he should have been\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Phillipa Suarez.</p> FIVER LETTER <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn his data dossier delight (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver), Big Louis went a long way toward proving the revered tactician Sam van Allardijk wrong: Manchester United haven\xe2\x80\x99t gone backwards under Van Gaal, they\xe2\x80\x99ve just gone Sideways. Echoing your newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the 2005 film, the United manager\xe2\x80\x99s argument somehow feels \xe2\x80\x98bathed in a solvent of exquisite sadness\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Peter Oh.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
