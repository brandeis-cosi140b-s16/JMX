b'Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s Jamie Vardy scales new heights with England call-up'


b'<p>It was a little more than three weeks ago, on a night when Chelsea ended Leicester City\xe2\x80\x99s hopes of racking up five successive victories, that Jamie Vardy received wider acclaim for the style of play that has been his trademark ever since he was leading the line for Stocksbridge Park Steels. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you ever stop running?\xe2\x80\x9d Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho said as the Chelsea manager embraced the Leicester striker.</p> <p>Vardy, by his own admission, is a pest, the sort of striker who refuses to give defenders a minute\xe2\x80\x99s peace whether they are trying to play out from the back or chase him into the channels. Pacy, direct and full of aggressive running, the 28-year-old likes nothing more than a one-on-one duel. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no sitting off, I just go straight at them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>That simple but effective approach has taken Vardy on a remarkable route from the eighth tier of the football pyramid on \xc2\xa330-a-week wages to the England squad. Even allowing for the absence of the injured Daniel Sturridge and unavailability of Harry Kane, Saido Berahino and Danny Ings, all of whom have been named in Gareth Southgate\xe2\x80\x99s Under-21 squad, it is some story for Vardy to be called up by Roy Hodgson.</p> <p>The England manager first set eyes on Vardy when he was playing for Fleetwood Town at Kidderminster three years ago. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was getting a lot of good reviews and it was an ideal opportunity to watch him play,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hodgson, who was the West Bromwich Albion manager at the time. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a cold night, a difficult surface and, to be honest, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a lot of chances to show what he could do, and neither did anyone else for that matter. It was a very competitive Conference match but you could see then he had some ability.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>By that stage Vardy\xe2\x80\x99s career was on an upward path after a difficult beginning. Rejected by Sheffield Wednesday as a teenager for being too small, the centre-forward packed in playing for a year and ended up wearing an electronic tag after being charged with assault following a brawl outside a pub.</p> <p>Vardy went to college and worked in factories as he tried to get his life and career back on track. From Stocksbridge he joined Halifax, then came the \xc2\xa320,000 transfer to Fleetwood that was the making of him. After scoring 31 league goals for the Conference club, Leicester took the plunge and paid \xc2\xa31m.</p> <p>It was a huge sum of money for a club to hand over for a player who had never made a league appearance but Steve Walsh, Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s joint assistant manager and head of recruitment, had followed Vardy closely and was convinced he could make the step up.</p> <p>Vardy struggled to adapt \xe2\x80\x93 he scored only five goals in his first season \xe2\x80\x93 and was so concerned with his failure to make an impact that he contemplated giving up. Nigel Pearson, Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s manager, Walsh and Craig Shakespeare, the other joint assistant, told Vardy they believed in him and their faith was rewarded with 16 goals the following season as Leicester won the Championship.</p> <p>Life in the Premier League has been up and down for Vardy \xe2\x80\x93 he went 21 top-flight games without a goal \xe2\x80\x93 but the abiding image of his first season at that level will be of the September afternoon at the King Power Stadium when he tormented Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s defence to such an extent that Ryan Giggs, sat alongside Louis van Gaal in the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 dugout, covered his eyes at one point.</p> <p>In a 5-3 victory Vardy set up the first, won two penalties, scored the fourth and even had a hand in Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s other goal. Not surprisingly, he has described it as the best game of his career. Tyler Blackett, the United defender who was dismissed for a foul on Vardy, must have had nightmares about the match.</p> <p>Although Leicester have deployed Vardy out wide in a three-prong attack at times this season, his best position is through the middle, which is where he has finished the campaign and played such a crucial part in the club climbing clear of the bottom three.</p> <p>A creator of goals as well as a scorer, Vardy likes to play on the last defender\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder and stretch opponents. One tactic that has worked particularly well for Leicester is for Vardy to spin into the space between the centre-half and full-back and gamble on Esteban Cambiasso sweeping a first-time \xe2\x80\x9cblind\xe2\x80\x9d pass into that area.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat pace and desire to run in behind defenders are always interesting for coaches,\xe2\x80\x9d Hodgson said. \xe2\x80\x9cHis latter part of the season with Leicester through the \xe2\x80\x98great escape\xe2\x80\x99 has been really excellent. We think he has some interesting qualities and that this will be a chance to see them at close hand.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 This article was amended on 22 May 2015 to correct the piece/peace homophone.</p>'
