b'Burnley v Chelsea \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>Scott Arfield\xe2\x80\x99s excellent goal would perhaps have given Chelsea much greater cause for concern if they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t battled back so quickly, but in the event Diego Costa\xe2\x80\x99s quickfire rebound steadied things within three minutes and, for the rest of the first half, the visitors were superb. We saw glimpses \xe2\x80\x93 more than glimpses \xe2\x80\x93 of why Mourinho was so keen to get hold of Cesc Fabregas, whose appreciation of space and peerless imagination complemented the movement and pace around him perfectly. This Chelsea side is faster and more direct, when it needs to be, than most of the Arsenal teams he played in and it might just bring out the best in him.</p> <p>His assist for Schurrle\xe2\x80\x99s goal, which came at the end of a team move whose gear changed explosively, should be studied again and again even if you\xe2\x80\x99re a weepy Gooner. If we\xe2\x80\x99re in for much more of that this season, then it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a pretty luscious nine months. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect of Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s night was Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s third goal, a soft one for Branislav Ivanovic, and that effectively killed the home side off.</p> <p>Chelsea weren\xe2\x80\x99t interested in doing all that much after the break but Burnley didn\xe2\x80\x99t allow themselves to be bullied either, staying in their faces and creating a half-chance or two. They\xe2\x80\x99ll give teams a good game here this season \xe2\x80\x93 we\xe2\x80\x99ll soon see whether that is enough. Next up for them: Swansea away. Next up for Chelsea: Leicester at home. Next up for me: the bus. Thanks for your company and emails \xe2\x80\x93 have a good night, see you soon.</p>'
