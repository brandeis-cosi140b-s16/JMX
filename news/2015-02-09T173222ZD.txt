b'<p>Set on the western edge of the Black Forest, just a short drive from France and Switzerland, Freiburg is a fairly unassuming city to be sat at such a major junction in Europe. The geography, though, suited a pivotal occasion for Borussia Dortmund on Saturday. J\xc3\xbcrgen Klopp and his players couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have had more of a sense of being at a crossroads had they been playing Blazin\xe2\x80\x99 Squad on the stereo as the team bus rolled up to the Mage Solar Stadion.</p> <p>There have already been plenty of points in this bizarre campaign of theirs in which one has felt that this must be the moment that they would react, of course \xe2\x80\x93 the October defeat at K\xc3\xb6ln, where Roman Weidenfeller gifted Simon Zoller the winner with an eccentric attempt to kick clear a cross, being beaten at Hertha Berlin by non-scoring alumnus Julien Schieber\xe2\x80\x99s strike or the limp loss at Werder Bremen just before Christmas all seemed lost opportunities to do so, while completely defying belief.</p> <p>The visit to SC Freiburg was, though, perhaps the first time in this dizzying tailspin that you felt that Dortmund really dare not lose. Home defeat by the season\xe2\x80\x99s surprise package Augsburg on Wednesday had not just kept them rooted to the bottom of the table, but had taken the whole club to some sort of breaking point.</p> <p>The footage of Weidenfeller and Mats Hummels scaling the fence in front of die Gelbe Wand to placate angry fans that was beamed across the world was notable not just for footballers actually deigning to speak to supporters in this day and age, but for the fact that these patient followers had reached their limit. It was these fans, remember, that unfurled the banner reading \xe2\x80\x9cUnd wenn du f\xc3\xa4llst, bin ich bei dir\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when you fall, I\xe2\x80\x99m with you\xe2\x80\x9d) after another abject defeat, at Eintracht Frankfurt in November.</p> <p>The firmest of faiths had been shaken. That was the case on the pitch too, with the players\xe2\x80\x99 nerves jangling almost as loudly as that famous terrace sings, as Klopp acknowledged. Raul Bobadilla\xe2\x80\x99s winner for Augsburg, driven in after Dortmund snatched at numerous chances to clear their lines, with a visual dictionary definition of panic.</p> <p>Putting that right was always going to be easier said than done, like so much of die Schwarzgelben\xe2\x80\x99s calamitous season to date. Freiburg are struggling, as they were always expected to be, but have returned from the Winterpause looking lean and mean, beating Frankfurt with loanee Nils Petersen\xe2\x80\x99s debut hat-trick \xe2\x80\x93 as referenced in last week\xe2\x80\x99s Talking Points \xe2\x80\x93 before being unlucky and narrow losers at Borussia M\xc3\xb6nchengladbach during the week.</p> <p>After so many scarring experiences in recent months, Klopp and his men simply needed a game where everything went right \xe2\x80\x93 and that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what they got in Brieslau on Saturday. From the moment when Freiburg\xe2\x80\x99s Mike Frantz inexplicably played a blind pass into the path of the onrushing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (\xe2\x80\x9cworse than an own goal,\xe2\x80\x9d in the words of home boss Christian Streich), with the Gabon striker presenting Marco Reus with a tap-in for the ninth-minute opener, it was as smooth as in the good old days when there was hope of a title race. Aubameyang struck twice in the second half and Dortmund had just their fifth Bundesliga win of the season.</p> <p>Nuri Sahin, perhaps inadvertently, revealed just how much reassurance Dortmund had needed when he reflected after the game that \xe2\x80\x9cthe first two goals helped us, and then everything we did started coming off\xe2\x80\x9d, echoing Klopp\xe2\x80\x99s insistence that the team \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t need just to believe my words, but to believe in themselves\xe2\x80\x9d. You could also argue that the victory didn\xe2\x80\x99t really answer the biggest question hanging over Dortmund heads this season \xe2\x80\x93 how they can solve their difficulties in playing proactively when in possession (they have more of the ball than any other Bundesliga team outside Bayern), rather than reactively. Hummels had suggested after the Augsburg defeat that \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s missing is us taking the lead so that we can then sit back and play on the counter\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s win also unmasked the true extent of the club\xe2\x80\x99s strategy failures in recent times as much as it sparked hope of a better tomorrow. Klopp started without big signings Ciro Immobile, Adri\xc3\xa1n Ramos or Henrikh Mkhitaryan, underlining that the perception of the club haemorrhaging its top stars is not even half of the personnel problem \xe2\x80\x93 what has been worse is that a clutch of expensive signings have been real let-downs. Aubameyang, who few would describe as an instant hit and Dortmund would have considered selling last summer, is the exception rather than the rule, and a rare bright spot in the season.</p> <p>The link play between Reus, Shinji Kagawa and Aubameyang for the third goal \xe2\x80\x93 the most fluent piece of \xe2\x80\x98classic\xe2\x80\x99 Dortmund we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen for some weeks \xe2\x80\x93 hinted that maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s a new pecking order as Klopp tries to find the right attacking balance, and that neither of last summer\xe2\x80\x99s forward signings are in it.</p> <p>It was ultimately just the start of a mini-championship in which Dortmund can evade the worst in this wreck of a season (and which has relegated a mouthwatering Champions League clash with Juventus to a mere sideshow). Next up are Mainz on Friday at the Signal Iduna Park (Dortmund would go level on points with Kasper Hjulmand\xe2\x80\x99s side by beating them), with a trip to current wooden-spooners Stuttgart to follow. Then \xe2\x80\x93 after the small matter of the visit to Juve \xe2\x80\x93 there\xe2\x80\x99s the Revierderby with Schalke and meetings with other strugglers in Hamburg and K\xc3\xb6ln before the Westfalen return against the Serie A champions.</p> <p>This was, at least, \xe2\x80\x9ca victory for the mind,\xe2\x80\x9d as Weidenfeller put it. Hummels, his fellow spokesman from Wednesday night, later tweeted a photo of himself with travelling supporters to show that the squad have their eye on what is important. This was the first step towards forgiveness.</p> Talking points <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Schalke moved up to third by beating fellow Champions League challengers Gladbach in the Friday night fixture, which promised much but delivered little in the way of excitement. It was simply very un-Schalke-like; disciplined and dogged, and wearing all the hallmarks of Roberto Di Matteo\xe2\x80\x99s influence, who has dragged the team up from 11th since arriving to succeed Jens Keller. This thrill-free template is not universally popular but the Italian coach could win more hearts and minds if it proves to be the blueprint to avoid another European roasting from Real Madrid in a few weeks\xe2\x80\x99 time.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 A second successive win for Hamburg means Joe Zinnbauer and company are up to the dizzy heights of 12th. Their 2-1 win over Hannover also took them up to a total of 14 Bundesliga goals for the season, with the new hero not recently-returned striker Ivica Olic, but Hannover\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate defender Marcelo \xe2\x80\x93 now der Dinosurier\xe2\x80\x99s joint-second top scorer after putting through his own net twice at the Imtech Arena on Saturday evening. His goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler declared himself \xe2\x80\x9clost for words,\xe2\x80\x9d calling his Brazilian team-mate \xe2\x80\x9ca good boy, but just horribly unlucky today\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 The Bundesliga has a new set-piece king. Zlatko Junuzovic scored his fourth direct free-kick in his last seven games against Bayer Leverkusen to give another back-from-the-dead giant, Werder Bremen, their eighth win in 12 Bundesliga matches since Viktor \xe2\x80\x98Victory\xe2\x80\x99 Skripnik took over from Robin Dutt in October. The Bosnian \xe2\x80\x93 who has also set up six goals with his corners this season \xe2\x80\x93 is usurping Hakan \xc3\x87alhanoglu, who gave Leverkusen hope with a goal at the other end. It was just a header, mind you.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 The completion of Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x82\xac32m (\xc2\xa324m, before add-ons) move to Wolfsburg this week saw Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s mastery of the post-FFP transfer market again widely celebrated. Yet as time goes on, it seems more apparent that the Lower Saxony club short-changed them in paying only \xe2\x82\xac25m for Kevin De Bruyne. The 23-year-old may have been surplus in SW6 but it is arguably the Bundesliga\xe2\x80\x99s best player at the moment \xe2\x80\x93 his two goals against Hoffenheim took him to eight for the season for Dieter Hecking\xe2\x80\x99s high-fliers, added to 11 assists \xe2\x80\x93 and Wolfsburg could probably sell him for double what they paid in the summer if they chose to.</p> <p>Results: Augsburg 2-2 Eintracht Frankfurt, Werder Bremen 2-1 Leverkusen, Hamburg 2-1 Hannover, K\xc3\xb6ln 0-0 Paderborn, Mainz 0-2 Hertha Berlin, Freiburg 0-3 Dortmund, Stuttgart 0-2 Bayern, Wolfsburg 3-0 Hoffenheim, Schalke 1-0 M\xc3\xb6nchengladbach.</p>'
