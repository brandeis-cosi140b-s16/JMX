b'Said & Done: Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s brand; Dinamo Minsk; and Satan\xe2\x80\x99s nun'


b'More than a club of the week <p>Barcelona \xe2\x80\x93 ready to drop Qatar as its shirt sponsor due to the reputational brand damage \xe2\x80\x93 but not to bring back Unicef instead. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Utopian for Unicef to be on the jersey again. We have to be competitive.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Explaining the rethink over 2010\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa3125m shirt deal \xe2\x80\x93 signed three months after 90 Nepalese workers were jailed in Qatar for striking over \xc2\xa327-a-week wages \xe2\x80\x93 Bar\xc3\xa7a president Josep Maria Bartomeu: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are sensitive to the current situation in Qatar, which has changed since four years ago. There are now social and political aspects which were not there when we signed.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Election news  <p>The Week One highlights from Fifa\xe2\x80\x99s presidential race:</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Fastest out of the blocks: Sepp, in Australia for the Asian Cup, talking up Australia\xe2\x80\x99s right to host a future World Cup \xe2\x80\x93 seven days after Fifa confirmed a ban on candidates mixing campaigning with official duties. Sepp: \xe2\x80\x9cVery few countries boast such a rich sporting culture.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Most supportive: Ghana\xe2\x80\x99s FA president Kwesi Nyantakyi on why Sepp deserves respect for giving money to African FAs. \xe2\x80\x9cYou will find he is very popular on the continent. Europeans don\xe2\x80\x99t understand that. They say it\xe2\x80\x99s not his own money but Fifa\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x93 but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the point.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Quote of the week: David Ginola, pulling out as a candidate after spending 14 days campaigning in return for a \xc2\xa3250,000 fee. \xe2\x80\x9cToday I have mixed emotions.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Plus best attitude: Sepp on what he has learned from 16 years in the job. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, it is impossible to make everybody happy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Sir Alex Ferguson the ambassador is laughing all the way to the bank | Daniel Taylor </p>   Meanwhile <p>Also last week from the football family:</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Sharpest reflexes: Spain\xe2\x80\x99s Fifa vice-president \xc3\x81ngel Mar\xc3\xada Villar \xe2\x80\x93 reacting to a government attempt to have his federation\xe2\x80\x99s accounts audited by threatening to suspend all football in Spain. Villar said the \xe2\x80\x9cstate intrusion\xe2\x80\x9d was unacceptable. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go on strike.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Most relaxed: Trinidad\xe2\x80\x99s Jack Warner, unmoved by news of a new government tribunal into his finances prompted by multiple fraud allegations, \xe2\x80\x9cpursuant to section 15 of the Integrity in Public Life Act\xe2\x80\x9d. Jack denies wrongdoing. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not in the least bit worried or concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Other news: busy week for\xe2\x80\xa6 <p>Manchester United \xe2\x80\x93 suspending season tickets unless fans pay \xc2\xa350 for a midweek cup replay seat, and unveiling a new Global Forex &amp; Online Financial Trading Partner. United say the firm was chosen for its \xe2\x80\x9cshared values of transparency and trust\xe2\x80\x9d, and for offering customers \xe2\x80\x9cthe ability to take their finances into their own hands\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Also giving fans a lift: a plan for more partners to follow Official Global Noodles Partner Nissin and the Official Responsible Drinking Partner Smirnoff. MD Richard Arnold: \xe2\x80\x9cOf the top 25 sponsorship categories, we were only active in 15. I think there\xe2\x80\x99s huge potential still for this club.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Most cautious <p>The PFA\xe2\x80\x99s Gordon Taylor: refusing to comment on news that several ex-players face bankruptcy after using alleged tax avoidance schemes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe rationale and motive for any investment is simply not known to us and we are mindful of making general comments which may be misconstrued.\xe2\x80\x9d Such as: Jan 2011 \xe2\x80\x93 Taylor on players using alleged tax avoidance schemes. \xe2\x80\x9cAny good financial adviser will tell players to make the best use of their money \xe2\x80\xa6 Every labourer is worth his hire.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Denial of the week <p>Belarus: Dinamo Minsk denying they barred a local radio host from applying to be their head of marketing after fans found his profile on a gay dating site. Dinamo blocked him as a candidate, citing \xe2\x80\x9cunprofessional conduct which damaged the image of this club\xe2\x80\x9d - but denied being pressured by the fans\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cNo Gays in Belarus\xe2\x80\x9d campaign against \xe2\x80\x9cthe employment of fags\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an internal matter.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Transfer news     Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho: not having it. Photograph: Action Images    <p>23 Jan, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho on Juan Cuadrado: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a player at Fiorentina. You speak about Cuadrado, you can speak about 10, 20 or 30 players and you ask me if I know them. If I don\xe2\x80\x99t know them I am in trouble because my son knows them, so I have to know them \xe2\x80\xa6 it\xe2\x80\x99s my job to know them. You can come at me with another name and I would have to say I know him. I know them all. But Cuadrado fits well in Fiorentina squad and Colombia squad, not in Chelsea squad.\xe2\x80\x9d 26 Jan: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t change the squad.\xe2\x80\x9d 31 Jan: Changes the squad.</p>  <p> Related: Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho facing Premier League punishment after press blackout </p>   Most misunderstood <p>China: Fluminense\xe2\x80\x99s Dar\xc3\xado Conca, signing a two-year \xc2\xa315m contract at Sven Goran Eriksson\xe2\x80\x99s Shanghai SIPG for football reasons. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not just money, no, there were issues at Fluminense. They had no vision. This move seemed like the best way forward.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Politics news: one to watch <p>Mexico: Puebla striker Cuauht\xc3\xa9moc Blanco, 42, running for mayor of Cuernavaca on a social respect agenda, two years after being fined \xc2\xa31,500 for mocking a referee\xe2\x80\x99s prominent jaw with \xe2\x80\x9csustained gurning gestures\xe2\x80\x9d. Local media: \xe2\x80\x9cThis was low behaviour.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Best attempt to avoid a fine <p>Iran\xe2\x80\x99s coach Carlos Queiroz, unhappy after their Asian Cup defeat. \xe2\x80\x9cWill the referee sleep tonight? It\xe2\x80\x99s just a question. If necessary I will kneel on the ground to show my respect and humble attitude to ask him. I emphasise one, two, three, four times, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a question. You decide. I\xe2\x80\x99m going home.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Most got at    <p>Cristiano: bal\xc3\xb3n o pu\xc3\xb1o de oro?</p>&mdash; Sor Luc\xc3\xada Caram (@sorluciacaram) January 25, 2015    <p>Argentinian nun Sister Luc\xc3\xada Caram, dealing with tough Twitter feedback after she responded to Cristiano Ronaldo\xe2\x80\x99s red card with the tweet: \xe2\x80\x9cCristiano: golden ball or fist?\xe2\x80\x9d Caram said replies from Real fans, including \xe2\x80\x9cnun or bitch?\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cSatan worshiper\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cnun witch\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cthe nun of Lucifer\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGod doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist\xe2\x80\x9d, were \xe2\x80\x9cthin-skinned\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cI like good football and fair play, for what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Plus: love news <p>Brazil: Model N\xc3\xbabia \xc3\x93liiver on what she learned from a life dating players in the 1990s. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery woman should sample a footballer, but they\xe2\x80\x99re quite hard to like. I see them as tampons: use once, then discard. Are there exceptions? Of course there are. About one in a million.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
