b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho: \xe2\x80\x98Chelsea did everything that champions need to do\xe2\x80\x99'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho celebrated his first league title since returning to Chelsea by making clear he wants to stay at Stamford Bridge for many years and using an old Portuguese saying to explain why he would not be swayed by \xe2\x80\x9cthe dogs\xe2\x80\x9d who criticise his team\xe2\x80\x99s style.</p> <p>Mourinho said he would remain in his job \xe2\x80\x9cfor as long as Mr Abramovich wants me\xe2\x80\x9d after Eden Hazard\xe2\x80\x99s goal gave his team a 1-0 win against Crystal Palace to confirm the title, before mounting a robust defence to the suggestion that Chelsea have not played with enough adventure since the turn of the year.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve shown everything since day one,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything football demands from a team we have had.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe had fantastic attacking football, fantastic domination, high percentages of ball possession, low percentages when we let the opposition have the ball strategically and times when we have defended amazingly well.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe did everything the team needs to do. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re champions. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we deserve it. Everybody knows that. The people who have a big face to say we don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve it are the ones who, in my country, we have a saying for: the dogs bark and the caravan goes by.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho must feel this is a special achievement even by his standards | Barney Ronay </p>   <p>That saying \xe2\x80\x93 os c\xc3\xa3es ladram mas a caravana passa \xe2\x80\x93 comes after what Mourinho perceives as undue criticism about his team\xe2\x80\x99s style of play. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s easy to be a pundit,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a pundit you win every game. You don\xe2\x80\x99t lose matches \xe2\x80\x93 fantastic job really. Maybe in 10 years\xe2\x80\x99 time, it\xe2\x80\x99s my job. Then I win every game.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNow, as a manager, I lose sometimes and it\xe2\x80\x99s a much more difficult job. But that the players are feeling now is fantastic. They deserve it.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been convinced about it for a long time. My experience, my maturity, was always present in the control of the emotions and the situation and during the season we had some crucial moments that we coped with in a fantastic way.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOn 1 January we were equal points with Man City after a heavy defeat against Tottenham and instead of that being a turning point that was actually our last defeat.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFrom that moment not one single defeat. So, I repeat, I think everybody knows that we deserve it. It\xe2\x80\x99s just that some don\xe2\x80\x99t say it. But they know.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s 2014-15 Premier League title-winning squad: how they rate | Dominic Fifield </p>   <p>Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s first reaction at the final whistle was to find his family in the stand and the manager admitted it has been a difficult week for him with his father falling ill and being taken to hospital in Portugal. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the game finished at Leicester I immediately got a private plane to go to Portugal and I was there with him at the most difficult moment, which was the surgery. After that everything is under control. He\xe2\x80\x99s strong, getting better and better. I\xe2\x80\x99m much more relaxed.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho paid tribute to Abramovich \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cHe is the man who won every title at Chelsea; if he has replicas, he needs a big house\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 and, true to form, he also praised his own work. \xe2\x80\x9cFor me it\xe2\x80\x99s a special feeling because I\xe2\x80\x99m maybe not the smartest guy when it comes to choosing countries and clubs. I could have chosen another club in another country where it\xe2\x80\x99s easier to be champions but I chose the most difficult league in Europe and club where I was happy before. In my country they say not to go back somewhere you were happy before because you risk that. So I took that risk. I\xe2\x80\x99m so happy to win another Premier League title.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
