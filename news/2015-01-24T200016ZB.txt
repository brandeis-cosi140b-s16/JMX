b'Bristol City\xe2\x80\x99s Joe Bryan ready to leap at FA Cup chance against West Ham'


b'<p>Sitting in the canteen at Bristol City\xe2\x80\x99s training ground, Joe Bryan is talking about pressure. Not the sort of pressure that comes with being a professional footballer and trying to win promotion from League One, or performing in front of a capacity crowd against West Ham United in the FA Cup on Sunday, but the huge responsibility that his father carries with him every day at work.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a heart surgeon,\xe2\x80\x9d Bryan says. \xe2\x80\x9cHe works at the BRI [Bristol Royal Infirmary] and he does a little bit of private practice. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen what it is like to work hard. He\xe2\x80\x99s out from seven in the morning until half past eight at night most days. People talk about footballers being under pressure but that\xe2\x80\x99s real pressure, life and death, saving people\xe2\x80\x99s lives every day. He probably has one of the most pressurised jobs you could have: people put their life into his hands. He enjoys it but it takes its toll on him, physically and mentally.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Bryan is an intelligent young man and speaks with great maturity. He was privately educated at Queen Elizabeth\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital school in Bristol, where he picked up three A*s, five As and a B at GCSE. But going to medical school and following in his father\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps was never on the agenda. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not very good with blood, which is probably the biggest problem,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, smiling.</p> <p>Pursing a career in professional football proved a wise choice. After joining his hometown club at the age of eight and coming through their academy, Bryan has earned rave reviews with his displays at left wing-back as part of a resurgent City side who are promising to make 2014-15 a season to remember. Joint top of League One on points and only 90 minutes from reaching Wembley in the Johnstone\xe2\x80\x99s Paint Trophy, City welcome West Ham to the building site that is Ashton Gate \xe2\x80\x93 the stadium is being redeveloped at a cost of \xc2\xa340m \xe2\x80\x93 in buoyant mood.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPeople always say that it\xe2\x80\x99s a sleeping giant. I think you can see the interest here, people realise we\xe2\x80\x99re winning games,\xe2\x80\x9d Bryan says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe thing is, I think the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re redeveloping the stadium this season is a bit of a hindrance. If all the stands were still there, I think they would be full every week because we\xe2\x80\x99re winning. But it will be nice when the ground is done. It\xe2\x80\x99s good to see development on and off the pitch. It\xe2\x80\x99s a positive time.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>At 1.7 metres (5ft 7in), there is not much of Bryan. Some of his old teachers questioned whether he would be physically strong enough to make it as a footballer and at one point City contacted his school to ask if he could stop playing rugby because he was \xe2\x80\x9cgetting battered and coming to training with dead legs and sore shoulders\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Bryan, however, is not short of ability. He is technically strong, quick, two-footed \xe2\x80\x93 all three of his goals for City this season have come via his right boot \xe2\x80\x93 and has an incredible leap, which led to him being nicknamed \xe2\x80\x9cSpringbok\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI never used to be so good [in the air],\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I broke my leg at the end of my first year as a scholar at the academy and they offered me a two-year pro contract the week after, so they were saying: \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99re putting our faith in you, get fit\xe2\x80\x99. So in that six months out I thought to myself: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m still quite small, I need to do some gym work\xe2\x80\x99. By the time I was fit, I was in the gym doing squats and cleans with weights. So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether that meant I could suddenly jump or it was always there and I just needed to do a little bit of gym work to release it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It turns out that he is not the only Bryan with a spring in their step and an involvement in professional sport. \xe2\x80\x9cMy sister [Lucy] is a pole-vaulter, I think she\xe2\x80\x99s No2 in Great Britain at the moment. She\xe2\x80\x99s been injured for the last six months with a stress fracture in her spine. But she\xe2\x80\x99s getting back and hopefully looking towards the Olympics in Rio. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got two older brothers as well. Tom plays local rugby and he\xe2\x80\x99s a primary school teacher. Will has just finished a masters in ecology and resource management.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As the only Bristolian playing regularly under Steve Cotterill, Bryan believes he gets cut a bit more slack by the club\xe2\x80\x99s supporters. That his first senior goal for the club came against Bristol Rovers, their bitter rivals, early last season in the Johnstone\xe2\x80\x99s Paint Trophy, also helps. \xe2\x80\x9cFans do go on about that goal when I bump into them,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s strange now because I can\xe2\x80\x99t really remember it, it\xe2\x80\x99s like a blur. At the time it didn\xe2\x80\x99t really register that it was on Sky and that the derby was so big because there hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been one for almost seven years.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Cotterill, who has turned City\xe2\x80\x99s fortunes around since replacing Sean O\xe2\x80\x99Driscoll 13 months ago, would like Bryan to weigh in with a few more goals like the one against Rovers. \xe2\x80\x9cI think last season when he came in, I had a bit of a tough time, I picked up some injuries and where we were in the league didn\xe2\x80\x99t help \xe2\x80\x93 it was almost a case of \xe2\x80\x98he\xe2\x80\x99s a young player, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to expose him to the pressure\xe2\x80\x99.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut I think I put in a good pre-season, did well, and I think he recognised that and gave me the chance to prove myself in the league. He\xe2\x80\x99s always challenging me, saying: \xe2\x80\x98You need to be scoring more, you need to be getting on the back post, you can\xe2\x80\x99t get beaten one-on-one\xe2\x80\x99. But he\xe2\x80\x99s been nothing but positive with me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>One area where there is no room for improvement for Bryan is in relation to the club quiz. Every player in the squad has taken part in a general knowledge competition to find Bristol City\xe2\x80\x99s brainiest footballer, and Bryan scored 10 out of 10 in his second round head-to-head against Karleigh Osborne.</p> <p>While keen to play down his intelligence \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cI got lucky with the questions\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Bryan points out with a smile that stereotyping footballers can be unfair. \xe2\x80\x9cMatt Smith is well educated, Wade [Elliott] is intelligent \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s not full of thick idiots in the dressing room like people think.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>There is certainly no shortage of football talent, as Bryan and his City team-mates hope to demonstrate in their clash with West Ham. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the lads are looking forward to pitting themselves against some of the best players in England,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cWest Ham are right up there and where they are in the Premier League for a reason. But it will be good to test ourselves, and we want to win any game we play in.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
