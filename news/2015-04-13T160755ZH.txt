b'Head-butts, lost teeth and a dressing room fight: Bundesliga kicks off | Raphael Honigstein'


b'<p>Germans, other Germans sometimes joke, love cars and dogs more than children. It\xe2\x80\x99s an old, cliched line and readers of this column will be relieved to learn that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x93 at all \xe2\x80\x93 apply to Bundesliga players. They tend not to have dogs.</p> <p>Still, coming between a professional fu\xc3\x9fballer and his drive is rarely advisable, as many unhappy stories indicate. Who can forget the heartfelt bromance between Stefan \xe2\x80\x9cmiddle finger\xe2\x80\x9d Effenberg and Brian Laudrup at Fiorentina, so cruelly getting cut short when the German took the Dane\xe2\x80\x99s new Mercedes SL for an illicit ride after Euro 1992? The extra 100km on the clock constituted a breach of trust from which there simply was no comeback. Effenberg, in hindsight, might have also done better placating his angry Viola team-mate. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want? It\xe2\x80\x99s not as if I stuck it to your wife\xe2\x80\x9d was lacking a bit in contrition as a reply.</p> <p>Bayer Leverkusen\xe2\x80\x99s press officer Dirk Mesch had a much better excuse handling Emir Spahic\xe2\x80\x99s car behind his back: the Bosnian defender had parked it in the wrong spot. Instead of thanking Mesch for his discreet valet service, however, Spahic went mad and throttled Mesch in the changing room, as Express revealed in September 2013. Leverkusen buried the matter. \xe2\x80\x9cJust one of those football misunderstandings between men,\xe2\x80\x9d they laughed it off.</p> <p>Until midnight on Wednesday, after Leverkusen\xe2\x80\x99s DFB Cup quarter-final defeat on penalties by Bayern Munich. This time, no one had touched the centre-back\xe2\x80\x99s car. However, a couple of Leverkusen stewards interfered with another, almost as important, status symbol in the modern footballer\xe2\x80\x99s world \xe2\x80\x93 access to the VIP stadium lounge for his entourage. The BayArena exclusive hospitality area is not quite the stuff that hip-hop videos are made of, eyewitness accounts suggest, but the irate Spahic nevertheless deemed that his loss of face was best punishable by the stewards suffering the same fate. The 34-year-old head-butted one of them. The victim lost four teeth. A mobile phone video captured the fracas in all its grubbiness.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEmir: one of us,\xe2\x80\x9d a deliberately provocative 04 banner in the away end in Mainz proclaimed on Saturday but the team and the board saw things very differently. The captain, Simon Rolfes, dedicated the 3-2 win to the injured employee \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9che is part of the Bayer family, we wish him all the best\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 others spoke of their shock at seeing the injured defender\xe2\x80\x99s violent outburst. At first, the club had wanted to wait for the police to conduct their own investigation but the appearance of the mobile footage had \xe2\x80\x9cleft no other choice,\xe2\x80\x9d as CEO Michael Schade put it on Sunday. The player\xe2\x80\x99s contract, valid until 2016, was rescinded \xe2\x80\x9cby mutual agreement\xe2\x80\x9d. The fact that a faster, technically better upgrade on the Bosnian was one of coach Roger Schmidt\xe2\x80\x99s priorities for the summer transfer window might have helped the club to arrive at their decision more easily but one hopes that it was made on principle. If you tolerate this, interns shot with airguns will be next.</p> <p>Sadly, that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only unsightly bout of manic street fighting in Germany\xe2\x80\x99s top flight this week. Bild revealed that Hamburg\xe2\x80\x99s Johan Djourou and Valon Behrami went head to head in the dressing room at half-time versus Wolfsburg, first in French, then mano a mano, rolling around on the floor on top of each other between studded boots and making so much noise that their opponents were disturbed in the adjoining dressing room. No cars were involved, by all accounts, only frustration about yet another disastrous showing from the relegation-threatened Northerners.</p> <p>In the second half, the performance of interim coach Peter Kn\xc3\xa4bel\xe2\x80\x99s men reached a new nadir; 2-0 for the second-placed Wolves flattered the home team in the end. You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even spin the fisticuffs as \xe2\x80\x9ca show of passion\xe2\x80\x9d as Djourou managed to get himself sent off for dissent with two brainless bookings in the space of four minutes. The CEO, Dietmar Beiersdorfer, threatened disciplinary measures but ruled out installing the third \xe2\x80\x93 no, fourth \xe2\x80\x93 coach of the season in place of Kn\xc3\xa4bel, whose grand record reads: L2, (goals) F0, A 6. Felix Magath, like a latter-day Lothar Matth\xc3\xa4us, has naturally announced his willingness to help in whatever capacity.</p> <p>Now that Paderborn \xe2\x80\x93 2-1 winners against Augsburg \xe2\x80\x93 and even VfB Stuttgart \xe2\x80\x93 3-2 over Bremen \xe2\x80\x93 are showing signs of life, even Hamburg\xe2\x80\x99s biggest strength of recent years \xe2\x80\x93 getting lucky with relegation rivals who are even worse \xe2\x80\x93 seems to have dissipated. They\xe2\x80\x99ve hit rock bottom, in the table and otherwise. Increasingly, all that\xe2\x80\x99s left is hope of redemption in the afterlife. The fear of passing on to second division hell was briefly replaced by the heavenly vision of a lean, haggard figure with a side parting digging the fossilised dinosaur out of the ground and turning him into a heavyweight predator once again. However, Thomas Tuchel, the designated next manager in either league, as Sky Sport News Germany revealed on Friday morning, denied having a \xe2\x82\xac3m-a-year agreement in place a couple of hours later. The 41-year-old will surely think long and hard whether his \xe2\x80\x9crule-breaker\xe2\x80\x9d schtick should go as far as trying his hand at the toughest task in German football, bar TSV 1860 Munich. No one could accuse him of shirking a challenge but most coaches and players of his calibre would much rather increase their chances of success by working with the best in the business. Beiersdorfer, you might recall, was of course in charge at Hamburg when Mainz\xe2\x80\x99s J\xc3\xbcrgen Klopp was regarded as an unsuitable appointment because of his penchant for distressed jeans and his stubble. Losing another one of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s most in-demand coaches before he\xe2\x80\x99s even had his first game on the bench would be no mean feat.</p> Talking Points <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 The aforementioned Klopp, by the way, experienced a week of extremely mixed emotions. On Tuesday, veteran Sebastian Kehl\xe2\x80\x99s extra-time thunderbolt helped BVB to an emotional 3-2 quarter-final win over Hoffenheim. The Dortmund coach had a feeling that his team would have to play Bayern in the next round again, for the fourth time in a row, so he \xe2\x80\x9cwatched Law and Order instead of the draw\xe2\x80\x9d, he said \xe2\x80\x93 and that\xe2\x80\x99s how it came to pass. Bayern will host the Black and Yellows in two weeks, when Dortmund\xe2\x80\x99s last chance to rescue the season could well come and go.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 In the league, the 3-1 defeat at Borussia M\xc3\xb6nchengladbach has left them in 10th spot, not beyond the possibility of squeezing into the Europa League places but bereft of any positive momentum. For the third time this season they conceded a goal within the opening minute \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cworld record,\xe2\x80\x9d sneered the sporting director, Michael Zorc, and once again the team looked physically well short of their best. Leverkusen, who had also gone 120 minutes in the cup and had 24 hours fewer to recover, appeared much fresher, by contrast. Perhaps it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a coincidence that Oliver Bartlett, BVB\xe2\x80\x99s former fitness guru, now works at 04.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Gladbach, who played one of their typically efficient games against a \xe2\x80\x9cbigger\xe2\x80\x9d team, will finish the season ahead of the other Borussia for the first time since 1991. More importantly, they only need six points from their last five games to finish in the top four. Schalke 04 are all but resigned to the Europa League after the second 0-0 \xe2\x80\x93 this time against Freiburg \xe2\x80\x93 in a row. It\xe2\x80\x99s an extraordinary achievement for the Foals, secured without much money but plenty of smart work by the manager, Lucien Favre, and the sporting director, Max Eberl.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 A Bayern team with only three substitutes beat Eintracht Frankfurt 3-0, mostly thanks to Robert Lewandowski, who\xe2\x80\x99s the \xe2\x80\x9cbest Lewandowski possible\xe2\x80\x9d at the moment, according to Pep Guardiola. Two goals from the Polish striker took his tally to 16 and it\xe2\x80\x99s not hyperbole to call him the most important player \xe2\x80\x93 along with Thiago \xe2\x80\x93 before Bayern\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Porto in the Champions League on Wednesday. Bayern are a more direct, centrist team without the injured wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Rib\xc3\xa9ry. The current set-up is beneficial for his game.</p> <p>Results Hannover 1-1 Hertha, Bayern 3-0 Eintracht, Schalke 04 0-0 Freiburg, Gladbach 3-1 Dortmund, Mainz 2-3 Leverkusen, Paderborn 2-1 Augsburg, HSV 0-2 Wolfsburg, Stuttgart 3-2 Bremen, K\xc3\xb6ln 3-2 Hoffenheim.</p>'
