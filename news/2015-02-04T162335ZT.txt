b"The Fiver | A blue-collared armless garment hanging off a peg with Tim Sherwood's name on it"


b'<p>TIM\xe2\x80\x99S IN! (NEARLY)</p> <p>Tim Sherwood. There he was, last season, on the touchline, managing Tottenham Hotspur, in his body warmer, hectically waving his non-insulated arms about. Put a paddle in each hand, and you\xe2\x80\x99d have been able to pick out a message in semaphore. W-H-Y-D-O-A-L-L-Y-O-U-C-L-O-W-N-S-I-N-T-H-E-P-R-E-S-S-B-O-X-K-E-E-P-R-E-F-E-R-R-I-N-G-T-O-M-Y-B-O-D-Y-W-A-R-M-E-R-A-S-A-G-I-L-E-T-I-T-S-A-B-O-D-Y-W-A-R-M-E-R-I-F-Y-O-U-R-E-F-E-R-R-E-D-T-O-Y-O-U-R-B-O-D-Y-W-A-R-M-E-R-A-S-A-G-I-L-E-T-I-N-T-H-E-D-R-I-N-K-E-R-R-O-U-N-D-M-Y-W-A-Y-Y-O-U-D-G-E-T-Y-O-U-R-E-A-R-S-W-A-R-M-E-D-A-N-D-A-W-E-L-L-A-I-M-E-D-A-N-D-W-E-L-L-D-E-S-E-R-V-E-D-B-O-O-T-U-P-T-H-E-A-R-S-E.</p> <p>But it was gilet this, gilet that, and gilet the other. The hack-yakking was so loud that you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear Sherwood quietly pointing out how, during his brief reign, he\xe2\x80\x99d won at Old Trafford, introduced Harry Kane and Nabil Bentaleb to the team, been the first man since 2008 to get a tune out of Emmanuel Adebayor, and achieved the highest winning percentage of any manager in Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s history. That\xe2\x80\x99s a whopping six per cent! (We\xe2\x80\x99re working from memory, but that sounds about right.) So there could be good times ahead for fans of Queens Park Rangers, because the talented but out-of-work Sherwood tops a three-man shortlist for the vacant managerial position at Loftus Road. He tops it because the other two people on the list, Derby manager Steve McClaren and Real Madrid No2 Paul Clement, are thought to be almost certainly not interested. But he does top it.</p> <p>McClaren spent a little time at Loftus Road as a coach under \xe2\x80\x98Arry Redknapp, teaching the old boy some innovative training methods, and in return learning the basics of how to balance a clutch while mouthing platitudes into a microphone on live television for up to 17 fact-free minutes at a time. Meanwhile Clement, whose late father Dave nearly won the league at QPR as a defender in 1976, has built up quite the CV working as Carlo Ancelotti\xe2\x80\x99s right-hand man at Chelsea, PSG and Real Madrid. Whether either man will be tempted to cash in a promotion bid or Big Cup chase for guaranteed relegation and the task of trying to entice Shaun Wright-Phillips out of a box filled with cotton wool in the storage room under the stairs \xe2\x80\x93 he\xe2\x80\x99s not coming out, it\xe2\x80\x99s warm in there \xe2\x80\x93 remains to be seen. Except it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really remain to be seen, does it. \xe2\x80\x9cI would say three interviews will be done,\xe2\x80\x9d insists owner Tony Fernandes, though let\xe2\x80\x99s face it, in the Loftus Road home dressing room, there\xe2\x80\x99s already a blue-collared armless garment hanging off a peg with Sherwood\xe2\x80\x99s name on it.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Scott Murray from 7.45pm GMT for MBM coverage of Bolton 0-2 Liverpool, while Paul Doyle will already be in the house at 7pm for the DR Congo 0-1 Ivory Coast Africa Cup of Nations semi.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe were inspired by the Emirates Stadium in London\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Milan announce fanciful grand plans for a new stadium. No need for noise warnings then, ho ho, ha ha, etc and so on.</p>      MORE OF YOUR MUNDANE ENCOUNTERS WITH FAMOUS PEOPLE \xe2\x80\xa6 <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn the late-80s/early-90s Neil Webb was doing lengths in Wilmslow public swimming pool during the half-term holiday. He was a pretty big deal at the time, having bust his achilles playing for England and costing Manchester United over \xc2\xa31m (a lot in pre-Premier League currency). We were a little amazed there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a pool at the United training ground he could have used. We did our best to avoid him when trying to bomb out of the gaze of the bored lifeguard. Later on we bumped into him in Sainsbury\xe2\x80\x99s car park. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t take his trolley back and just pushed it towards the trolley rank from his car. You have to pay \xc2\xa31 to use trolleys these days\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Dan Ashley.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI once saw Hatem Ben Arfa shopping with his mum in Ponteland Waitrose. He was being a very dutiful son, fetching miscellaneous items of shopping from other aisles while she examined the vegetables. And at no time did he get lost in a mazy run around the ready meals or go over clutching his ankle after an encounter with a trolley. He will be sorely missed in the more high-toned supermarkets of the north east\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Paul Steeples.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBack in the early-90s, I spotted the then-Oldham Athletic midfield dynamo Neil Redfearn (now Nasty Leeds gaffer) in front of me at the cash machine in Rochdale town centre. As he turned around, the best I could come up with was \xe2\x80\x98I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ve left some money in there for me Neil\xe2\x80\x99, to which he replied: \xe2\x80\x98Yes, of course\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Carl Bamford.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a Southampton fan, who had just moved to Sydney, and was disembarking from one of those quaint green-and-yellow harbour ferries close to my new flat when I bumped into Gordon Strachan competing to get on the one-at-a-time gangplank to the wharf. With a nod of acknowledgement, which I hope conveyed both my disappointment at his recent resignation but also my gratitude for that run to the FA Cup final, I stood back to allow him and his wife off first\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Stuart Holden.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was a boy, then-Aberdeen and Scotland defender Brian Irvine (no relation) used to use the same bank that my parents used. I met him pretty regularly there and got his autograph every time. I remember getting him to sign a scrap of the Argos catalogue once. (Un)interestingly enough, I now sit opposite his son\xe2\x80\x99s brother-in-law at work. Star-crossed, I tell thee. How\xe2\x80\x99s that for mundane?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Iain Irvine. </p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cGranted the football connection is tangential but, as a wee slip of a lad around seven or eight years of age, I was at the local village fete (on the local football field) back in the day when it was possible to get a reasonably priced ex-Miss World to turn up and open said extravaganza. Anyway, after carving my name on a local\xe2\x80\x99s fence-post with a shard of glass, I felt the need to go running off at a speed of knots and decided to launch myself over a wooden bench, just as ex-Miss World was returning to the pavilion for the free pork pie buffet and unwanted attention of local dignitaries. I tripped over the bench and bent my arm at an unnatural angle, and upon hearing of my plight, the lady at the centre of this story knelt down and placed my head in her lap until the arrival of the St John\xe2\x80\x99s Ambulance. So although many have [Snip \xe2\x80\x93 Fiver Lawyers], I can say I have had my head in a Miss World\xe2\x80\x99s lap\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Chris Steele.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a slight shift in direction. At a bar in the ski hills of Colorado a few years back, I noticed Steve Sanders, who you all remember fondly was played by Ian Ziering on the original Beverly Hills 90210. Me: \xe2\x80\x98Hello Ian, how was your day on the slopes?\xe2\x80\x99; Steve Sanders: [ignores me, drags his large minder between us]. I have since gone from strength to strength working as a lawyer and Steve, according to 90210 Wiki, remains unhappily working at the Peach Pit. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it funny how things work out?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Chris Blane [ahem \xe2\x80\x93 Fiver Ed].</p> \xe2\x80\xa6 AND THE REST OF THE FIVER LETTER <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rise to it \xe2\x80\xa6 I really shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t but, clutch biting point in \xe2\x80\x98Arry\xe2\x80\x99s Range Rovers (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver)?
