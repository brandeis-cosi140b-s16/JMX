b'Liverpool display leaves Brendan Rodgers confident of reaching final'


b'<p>Brendan Rodgers said Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Capital One Cup semi-final display left him in no doubt they can win the second leg at Chelsea next week, when Daniel Sturridge may make his long-awaited return from injury.</p> <p>The Liverpool manager was aggrieved at the 1-1 scoreline and the referee Martin Atkinson\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to award his team a penalty when Diego Costa handled. Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s outstanding goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois, also escaped sanction for handling outside his area as he gathered from Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s goalscorer, Raheem Sterling.</p> <p>Otherwise, and in contrast to Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho, who lamented Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s carelessness in possession, Rodgers was emboldened by a Liverpool performance he claimed had set a benchmark for the remainder of the season.</p> <p>Eden Hazard gave Chelsea the lead from the penalty spot having been up-ended by Emre Can but Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side were restricted to only two shots all game. Their average in the Premier League this season is 16 and their previous lowest tally was five.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI thought we were outstanding,\xe2\x80\x9d Rodgers said. \xe2\x80\x9cChelsea will probably be happy with the draw because we definitely deserved to win. It was a big performance from us. It is always difficult against Chelsea because they sit in a low block, the spaces are closed and, especially if you go behind, they know how to defend. They will be happier in terms of the scoreline but I am happy our performance levels are improving all of the time.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was confident we could win at Stamford Bridge and that has reinforced it even more. You see how good we were defensively, we were aggressive and compact and they have got top-class players. I thought the performance was a benchmark. There is no doubt we can go to the second leg and get the performance and the result we need.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>           Brendan Rodgers: Chelsea were lucky to draw against Liverpool.    <p>Mourinho was satisfied with the outcome, given that his side will enjoy home advantage in next Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s second leg, but not with the performance from his Premier League leaders.</p> <p>The Chelsea manager said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a two-legged semi-final and now it becomes a one leg semi-final at Stamford Bridge. We have to win and Liverpool have to win a one legged semi-final at Stamford Bridge. Obviously Liverpool didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to lose but I got frustrated because we had lots of situations where we recovered the ball in a low block.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe recovered the ball so many times, we faced three defenders in a tactical system, with lots of space to counterattack and Eden, Willian and Diego in great positions, but we lose so many passes. Recover the ball, lose the ball. It was exactly the opposite of what happened [in the 5-0 win] against Swansea. That frustrated me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Rodgers bemoaned Atkinson\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to award Liverpool a first-half penalty or to dismiss Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s goalkeeper for carrying the ball outside his box. He said: \xe2\x80\x9cI was so disappointed we never got at least one penalty. It is a clear handball by Costa so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get that. Their goalkeeper, who had to be outstanding, also handballed it outside the area.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Liverpool manager suggested Sturridge, who has been absent since August with calf and thigh injuries, could be involved against his former club at Stamford Bridge. \xe2\x80\x9cDaniel has really kicked on in his rehab,\xe2\x80\x9d Rodgers said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has done really well in training today so we will see how he does between now and then.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho would not be drawn on whether Chelsea are favourites to reach Wembley and claimed \xe2\x80\x9cit is too difficult\xe2\x80\x9d to win a clean sweep of domestic trophies in one season. He also insisted there was no difficulty in dropping Petr Cech back to the bench despite the goalkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s impressive recent form during Courtois\xe2\x80\x99 absence through injury.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe Premier League is full of top goalkeepers but we have the two best so for me it is so easy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTo have both playing so well and giving so much confidence to the team that the players don\xe2\x80\x99t care who is playing, that is fantastic. I decide who is playing according to the profile of the game we are expecting. I think the best three keepers in the world are Petr, Courtois and [Manuel] Neuer, and Courtois is 22 years old.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
