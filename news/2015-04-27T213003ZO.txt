b'Olivier Giroud sees Arsenal progress and shrugs off Thierry Henry barb'


b'<p>Olivier Giroud is proud of the progress he and his Arsenal team-mates have made this season, despite drawing stinging criticism from Thierry Henry over the weekend, and believes he can be an integral part of a side who challenge for the title.</p> <p>The former Montpellier forward has scored 17 goals in all competitions, recently scoring in six successive Premier League games as Arsenal mustered an eight-match winning streak. Yet Henry clearly remains unconvinced as to his compatriot\xe2\x80\x99s ability and, in his capacity as a pundit on Sky at Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s goalless draw with Chelsea, suggested Giroud \xe2\x80\x9cdoes a job but you can\xe2\x80\x99t win the league [with him]\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cTo get second in the league and win the FA Cup would be a great season,\xe2\x80\x9d Giroud said. \xe2\x80\x9cI know we can still improve ourselves and that is what we have been doing since I signed for Arsenal. I am proud of what I\xe2\x80\x99ve done and I\xe2\x80\x99m pleased with that. I just want to carry on like that and I know if we keep our best players and this determination with the team spirit, I am sure we are going to join this championship race next season.</p>  <p> Related: Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wengerfrustrated as Arsenal fail to break down Chelsea | Dominic Fifield </p>   <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt has been a few years since we finished second and, if we can do it, we can see an improvement, which is great. Next year, hopefully, we will have fewer injuries, will keep the same group and, with maybe one or two new players, we will have a great season I am sure.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs for myself, in sport you have to question yourself every week and be ready in your head and you have to be at 100% of determination if you want to keep going and win games; you cannot afford to be at 80% or 90%. You have to have faith in your own qualities, that is part of being a footballer: being strong in your head. That is more than half of the quality you need to be a football player.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The France international conceded that this season\xe2\x80\x99s race was over as Arsenal have failed to eat into Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s 10-point advantage at the top. Giroud admitted grudging respect for the manner in which the leaders secured their point at the Emirates Stadium, to a chorus of \xe2\x80\x9cboring, boring Chelsea\xe2\x80\x9d from the home support, with their consistency having left them on the verge of a first title in five years.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBoring? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know but there is the table which speaks for them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is true maybe they are not [playing] the same game as us but we are not going to change our game and I think they are not going to change their game. I think they are pleased with that and if they are champions, what can you say?\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
