b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho hints at inconsistency as Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger row rumbles on'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has suggested he would have been heavily sanctioned by the game\xe2\x80\x99s authorities had he shoved a rival coach, as Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger pushed him at Stamford Bridge two weeks ago, with the Chelsea manager also sarcastically claiming he has \xe2\x80\x9ca lot to learn about how to behave\xe2\x80\x9d from Paul Lambert and Roy Keane after their recent criticisms.</p> <p>While the Aston Villa staff\xe2\x80\x99s frustrations had been born of Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to shake their hands before the final whistle as the London club prevailed 3-0 last month, the incident with Wenger drew the focus during the first half of the derby win over Arsenal just before the international window. Wenger had been enraged by Gary Cahill\xe2\x80\x99s foul on Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez in front of the home dugout and walked down the touchline, apparently to check on his player, only for Mourinho to bar entry into the Chelsea technical area.</p> <p>The Frenchman pushed the Portuguese in the chest, and raised his hands again in the confusion which followed, before the referee Martin Atkinson and the fourth official Jonathan Moss restored order. The incident had been observed at the time by the officials, who deemed no further sanction necessary and therefore, effectively, ensured the Football Association would not impose retrospective action.</p> <p>The Chelsea manager was fined three times last season by the FA \xe2\x80\x93 for his manner on the touchline against Cardiff and Aston Villa, and for his sarcastic appraisal of the officials following a loss to Sunderland \xe2\x80\x93 with his assistant, Rui Faria, receiving a six-match stadium ban for his furious reaction on the sidelines during the defeat to the Wearsiders. Yet he hinted at double standards when it came to dealing with the incident with Wenger. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised (Wenger was not charged), not surprised,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho, who was then asked if he would expect to have been charged had he committed the same offence. \xe2\x80\x9cCharged?\xe2\x80\x9d he replied. \xe2\x80\x9cCharged? For me [it would have been] a stadium ban.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Keane and Lambert were more unimpressed with his eagerness to shake their hands early, branding the action \xe2\x80\x9cdisgraceful\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdisrespectful\xe2\x80\x9d. The Villa assistant manager subsequently suggested Mourinho \xe2\x80\x9cwould get knocked out\xe2\x80\x9d if he attempted such an action during a Sunday League fixture. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if (Keane) really feels it, or if he wants to sell books and needs my help for that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I know my nature, I know my intentions. From people like him and his boss, I think I have a lot to learn about how to behave and I appreciate the comment. They are both two great examples of polite and very well educated people, and because I\xe2\x80\x99m a humble guy who tries to learn every day and with every experience, I appreciate the comments.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe moment I consider fundamental is to shake hands before the match and, before the match in my house [home stadium], it\xe2\x80\x99s my responsibility. So I always go to the opponents\xe2\x80\x99 dugout, or in the tunnel before the game. I\xe2\x80\x99m not doing the handshake for the pictures, but as a courtesy. That I always do. After the game, it depends on you, on the others. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a problem for me. But I repeat: I listen to the comments and I try to learn.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The 51-year-old has made a habit of shaking hands early, having previously done so with Sir Alex Ferguson when winning at Manchester United and with Louis van Gaal in the 2010 Champions League final. He did so with Jens Keller during the draw with Schalke earlier this season, and indicated he will continue to offer his hand early, perhaps starting at Selhurst Park on Saturday. Chelsea lost to Crystal Palace there last season and go into this fixture with Diego Costa\xe2\x80\x99s involvement still in doubt, the Spain forward having spent the week undergoing treatment on his thigh having played 172 minutes for his country against Slovakia and Luxembourg over the international window.</p> <p>Costa remains in need of a prolonged period of rest, with Chelsea considering when best to impose that given the midweek Champions League game against Maribor and next Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Old Trafford. Didier Drogba is still struggling with an ankle injury, leaving Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my as the only fully-fit forward in the squad.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI gave my Spain players two days off, Monday and Tuesday, and told them to report to training on Wednesday at 3pm,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Diego was here on Monday at 9am. So you can imagine how strong he was to be here at that time.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
