b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s TV conspiracy: six of the Chelsea manager\xe2\x80\x99s best complaints'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho attacked Sky\xe2\x80\x99s coverage of Diego Costa\xe2\x80\x99s two \xe2\x80\x9caccidents\xe2\x80\x9d against Liverpool as another symptom of the football community campaign to bring him down \xe2\x80\x93 including quiet fans, time-wasting ball-boys and fat referees. But it is the media\xe2\x80\x99s role in the conspiracy that Mourinho has been trying to expose for a decade.</p> On idle scoundrel parasites \xe2\x80\x93 2005 <p>Asked how he rated the role of professional TV pundits, Mourinho told the Sunday Express: \xe2\x80\x9cThe best job in the world is to be a sacked coach. You get up at 10.30am, take breakfast, go for a jog followed by a sauna and a calm surf of sporting sites on the net.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLunch with friends, a siesta, a walk, a meeting with your adviser to see how the markets are doing, a visit to the bank to weigh up the interest rates, or to see if the salary the club is still paying you has cleared the account. Return home, have a great meal with the family. That still leaves you time to criticise people you don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere are so many coaches in this world who want to work but can\xe2\x80\x99t and there are those dashing blades who, through their quality and prestige, could work but don\xe2\x80\x99t want to, because life as a parasite fulfils them professionally and economically. Get to work you idle scoundrel! And if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to, let others work in peace.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Concerted, organised intellectual manipulation \xe2\x80\x93 2009 <p>Four years later, the pundit problem had become more sophisticated, involving current and former coaches using the media to undermine his Internazionale side. \xe2\x80\x9cThere has been the greatest amount of intellectual manipulation. There was a concerted, organised effort to manipulate public opinion.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was fantastic work but it is unrelated to my world \xe2\x80\x93 I work in football. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like intellectual prostitution, I like honesty.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOver the last few days nobody has mentioned that Roma have great players but will end the season without a title. Nobody has mentioned that Milan have 11 fewer points than us and will end the season without a title. Nobody has spoken about Juventus, who have won so many points thanks to refereeing mistakes. We have only won one game thanks to a mistake and that was the Siena match \xe2\x80\xa6</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEvery time I turn on the TV I see Luciano Spalletti, who is everyone\xe2\x80\x99s friend, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t like prime-time television. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether these people pay to be interviewed. I know that they offer me money for interviews and I refuse because I don\xe2\x80\x99t manipulate reality.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> The English disease \xe2\x80\x93 2013 <p>Back at Chelsea, it was getting personal. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are lots of people on TV, but nobody is a Chelsea man. Carragher, Liverpool. Thompson, Liverpool. Redknapp, Liverpool. Neville, Manchester United. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have one. When I retire, 75 years old, I go as a pundit to defend Chelsea on television.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Redknapp\xe2\x80\x99s in charge \xe2\x80\x93 April 2014 <p>Sky\xe2\x80\x99s Geoff Shreeves asks Mourinho to weigh up Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s win over Liverpool at Anfield, and to talk viewers through his tactical plan. \xe2\x80\x9cYou speak with Jamie Redknapp and he tells you everything about it. You have your pundits like Jamie Redknapp, who is a brilliant football brain they can explain you everything.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Joining the dots \xe2\x80\x93 Dec 2014 <p>After identifying a refereeing conspiracy against Chelsea this season, Mourinho identified what was driving it: a media conspiracy. \xe2\x80\x9cThe media, commentators, other managers are all doing it [putting pressure on referees]. There is a campaign against Chelsea. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why there is this campaign and I do not care.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Diego Costa\xe2\x80\x99s accidents \xe2\x80\x93 Jan 2015 <p>But deep down, he does. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you understand by a stamp,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho told the print media after Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s Capital One Cup win. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe you are already influenced by the campaign on the television with the certain pundits saying that Costa has crimes \xe2\x80\x93 they must be nuts the guy who says that. I saw the incident and about the penalty I didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak. If I comment about that I will be in trouble.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSky calls it a crime, I have to say that it was absolutely accidental. He goes to the ball, he chases it, the opponent goes to the floor and he puts his foot there when he is looking at the ball.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a great campaign, we know how much that pundit loves Chelsea and particularly loves me. When you are there and you are paid, and you are very well paid, much more than some managers that have to put their ass for 90 minutes every week on the bench. You have a very good seat, very good money, no pressure.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey are always right, they never lose, they always win and they have to be fair and they have to be honest.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
