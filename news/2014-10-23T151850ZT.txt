b'The Fiver | A convenient scapegoat'


b'TEXTBOOK STUFF <p>When the Fiver turns up for work and asks a colleague \xe2\x80\x93 nay, a friend \xe2\x80\x93 to swap shirts midway through its shift, it does not tend to go well. A quick look at the Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s string vest is all it takes to spot that it is covered in crumbs and stains and dandruff, while a quick sniff reveals a pungent combination of stale tears and disappointment. \xe2\x80\x9cNo thanks, Fiver,\xe2\x80\x9d comes the general reply. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd don\xe2\x80\x99t think telling me that it\xe2\x80\x99s not your fault your washing machine has been broken since 1997 is going to help!\xe2\x80\x9d All of which has the knock-on effect of making the Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s bottom lip tremble and its eyes well up once more as it slopes sadly back to its desk. Sure enough, the tears soak the vest, they stay there for a few days, the cycle continues, it never ends. Repeated rejection is hard to take.</p> <p>You see even more shirt-swapping in football. Traditionally it is done after the final whistle and that\xe2\x80\x99s fine. But some renegades like to mix it up, throw the rulebook out of the window, shouting a few obscenities at it as it flies through the air, and swap shirts with the opposition at half-time. And then all hell breaks loose. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will deal with it,\xe2\x80\x9d said a seething Brendan Rodgers, his back up after hearing that Mario Balotelli had expended enough effort to swap shirts with Pepe at the end of a first half in which Liverpool had made Real Madrid look like QPR with better finishing and no own-goal machines in defence. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had an incident with a player last year and we did it internally. It is not something I stand for. If you want to do that, you do it at the end of the game. It is something I will deal with tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It was textbook stuff from Rodgers, the way he used the ultimately irrelevant Balotelli controversy as a way of deflecting the blame for Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s 3-0 defeat; instead of focusing on his team\xe2\x80\x99s inability to deal with high crosses or the failure of his big-money summer signings to make an impact yet, it was all on Balotelli, rather than the hero who signed him. For let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget that Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s defeat, and indeed their indifferent start to the season, is not down to Balotelli alone. He is a convenient scapegoat but the way that Dejan Lovren and Martin Skrtel keep running into each other in defence and Simon Mignolet keeps donning the clown costume before going in goal might also have something to do with it. Much more of this and Uefa will have to start questioning what the likes of BATE Borisov, Maribor and Liverpool are adding to Big Cup.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Jacob Steinberg from 6pm BST for MBM coverage of Lille 2-1 Everton, followed at 8.05pm by Tottenham 2-1 Asteras Tripoli, with Ian McCourt.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI really believe from a footballing perspective all the experiences that we have had \xe2\x80\xa6 what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 the Fiver wants to know more about John Barnes\xe2\x80\x99s previous football experiences after this pop at the sensationalist nature of recent book releases.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel.

We were watching Barcelona v Ajax and I informed him that I saw Nottingham Forest beat both of those clubs in competitive European fixtures in 1980. After only a slight pause his response was \xe2\x80\x98so what happened next?\xe2\x80\x99. I wistfully thought of Malmo and Anderlecht also playing in Big Cup this week and said \xe2\x80\x98I really don\xe2\x80\x99t have the time to go through it all\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Brendan Mackinney.</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
