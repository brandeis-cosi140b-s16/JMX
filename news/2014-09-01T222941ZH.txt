b'Harry Redknapp reunited with Sandro and Niko Kranjcar at QPR'


b'<p>Queens Park Rangers\xe2\x80\x99 frantic attempts to add to their options ahead of the deadline yielded the Brazil international Sandro from Tottenham Hotspur and a return to Loftus Road for Niko Kranjcar, though efforts to secure a replacement for Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my were frustrated.</p> <p>Sandro joined in a deal that could end up costing Rangers \xc2\xa310m having seen his opportunities limited at White Hart Lane. Harry Redknapp had secured the midfielder for Spurs from Internacional four years ago and he had gone on to start 60 Premier League games for the north London club, though he has not featured since Mauricio Pochettino took up the reins at Tottenham earlier this summer.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSandro\xe2\x80\x99s a proper footballer and a top-class professional, he\xe2\x80\x99s an absolutely fantastic signing for us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Redknapp. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more pleased. He\xe2\x80\x99s been a massive target of mine all summer and I honestly didn\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99d be able to pull it off. It\xe2\x80\x99s a real statement from the club, from the owners, to bring in a player of his undoubted ability. He brings energy, aggression, power and quality. They call him the Beast. He\xe2\x80\x99s not only a top-quality footballer, but a fantastic boy as well. He\xe2\x80\x99ll lead by example for us. Tottenham fans loved him and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure the QPR fans will too.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Kranjcar, who spent last season on loan at Loftus Road, has joined on another year\xe2\x80\x99s loan from Dynamo Kiev having taken a wage cut of 66%, according to Redknapp, to return to English football, where he has previously featured for Spurs and Portsmouth. Yet there was frustration for Rangers to endure on other mooted deals. An attempt to secure the former Arsenal, Chelsea and Portsmouth midfielder Lassana Diarra from Lokomotiv Moscow fell through due to a dispute between the 29-year-old and the Russian club.</p> <p>An attempt to get Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Francis Coquelin on a season-long loan also failed, while a potential \xc2\xa310m move for Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Fabio Borini was scuppered by the Italian\xe2\x80\x99s personal terms despite lengthy talks with the player\xe2\x80\x99s representatives. It is understood the forward was seeking in the region of \xc2\xa390,000 a week to move to London, an amount which was considered prohibitive at Loftus Road. Redknapp had explored the possibility of securing Norwich City\xe2\x80\x99s Gary Hooper, who was priced out of a move back to the Premier League, after Toronto resisted attempts to lure Jermain Defoe back to England from Major League Soccer.</p> <p>The Canadian club made it clear the striker would not be available until January at the earliest. \xe2\x80\x9cWe did try for him and we came close,\xe2\x80\x9d said the QPR owner, Tony Fernandes. \xe2\x80\x9cWe agreed terms with the player, but his club in MLS didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to let him go. We\xe2\x80\x99ll probably come back to that in January because Jermain is happy to come here. But, for now, Harry is confident we have enough up front.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
