b'Brendan Rodgers backed by FSG to walk through Liverpool storm'


b'<p>Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 job as Liverpool manager is not under threat, with the club having no plans to review his position despite their dismal end to the season that featured only one victory in the last seven matches.</p> <p>On Sunday Rodgers oversaw a humiliating 6-1 defeat at Stoke City, Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s worst result since 1963. Yet despite that, and a growing clamour from supporters to see the Northern Irishman replaced, Fenway Sports Group, the owner, is not assessing whether he should continue as manager for next season.</p> <p>There will, however, be a review of Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s disappointing campaign. This will be led by Mike Gordon, the FSG president who is a member of the club board, plus Rodgers and Ian Ayre, the chief executive.</p>  <p> Related: Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 Liverpool signings show a flaw that cannot be ignored | Barney Ronay </p>   <p>While communication goes on between Rodgers and FSG, based in Boston, there is no immediate rush to hold the review and it appears unlikely to be this week.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the Stoke defeat Rodgers apologised to fans and appeared to throw his future into doubt by saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve always said if the owners want me to go, I go. It\xe2\x80\x99s as simple as that. I still feel I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot to offer here. A lot has happened this year that has made the job difficult and we\xe2\x80\x99ve kept fighting right to the very end but I totally understand that [question].\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>When the review is held an explanation will be required for some of the more damning statistics returned by Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 team this year.</p> <p>The defeat by Stoke meant the team finished in sixth place, compared with last season\xe2\x80\x99s second, and the 62 points won were 22 fewer than in 2013-14.</p> <p>There have been 52 league goals compared with the 101 Liverpool managed 12 months ago and the 12 league defeats were twice as many as in the previous campaign. Against the clubs that finished in the top four \xe2\x80\x93 Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal and Manchester United \xe2\x80\x93 Liverpool scored only one victory, over City, and managed a total of five points from the 24 available.</p> <p>Rodgers also spent \xc2\xa3115m last summer following the sale of Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez to Barcelona for \xc2\xa375m. Adam Lallana, Emre Can, Dejan Lovren, Mario Balotelli, Lazar Markovic, Alberto Moreno, Rickie Lambert and Divock Origi were signed. There is a case to be made that all, apart from Can, have been a failure.</p> <p>However, there is an acceptance that, having lost Su\xc3\xa1rez, who has been an integral part of Bar\xc3\xa7a\xe2\x80\x99s La Liga-winning success and their progress to next month\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League final, Rodgers was bound to struggle to replace such a talent.</p>  <p> Related: Fan view: Brendan Rodgers \xe2\x80\x93 should Liverpool give him more time? </p>   <p>The manager has also been without Daniel Sturridge, his main remaining striker, for most of the season due to the 25-year-old suffering injuries and the hip problem that ended his campaign will also rule him out of the start of next term.</p> <p>In addition the controversy regarding Raheem Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s public efforts to leave the club have been a distraction for Rodgers and his players, as has the farewell to Steven Gerrard that began when he announced in early January he would leave the club.</p> <p>Yet despite these mitigating factors Rodgers understands the dismay from fans and, more importantly, FSG, and knows that he must recruit well this summer as he will be under scrutiny when next season starts.</p> <p>Rodgers hopes to add City\xe2\x80\x99s James Milner and Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s impressive striker Danny Ings with Origi also arriving from Lille, having been loaned back to the French club last season after joining Liverpool last summer.</p>'
