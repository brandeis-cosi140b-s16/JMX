b'<p>A crowd gathered in the corner of the Calder\xc3\xb3n. Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid fans poured down crumbling concrete stairs looking over the Manzanares river through grubby windows, crossed the concourse inside the main stand and headed back towards the pitch where the exits in the south-west corner lead out of the stadium. There, they stopped. The flow ground to a halt and cameras were pulled out; something was happening just ahead. Eventually, shuffling slowly through, pushing past the bottleneck to the stairs, they realised what it was. And then they too took pictures.</p> <p>Just above them, positioned over the exit, was the scoreboard and the scoreboard said Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid 4, Real Madrid 0 It was almost 6pm on Saturday and they had been enjoying this for almost two hours now, finding themselves in the unthinkable position of knowing that they were going to win, mocking Real Madrid. \xe2\x80\x9cPlayers, players, show those Vikings who rules the capital,\xe2\x80\x9d they had sung; a Mexican wave had raced round the stands; and there had been ol\xc3\xa9s too. They\xe2\x80\x99d known, but now they took pictures hurriedly, as if the score would change if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t, as if confirmation were needed.</p> <p>Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid 4, Real Madrid 0.</p> <p>The following morning, Marca\xe2\x80\x99s cover led on 4tl\xc3\xa9tico 0. Others followed suit. This was historic, barely believable, and yet there was something logical about it too. Diego Simeone had done it again. Think about it for a moment: Has there ever been an achievement like this? Has there ever been a manager who has revolutionised a club like he has revolutionised Atl\xc3\xa9tico, changing their history, their identity? Brian Clough perhaps. The man who took over a club in crisis won the Europa League in his first season, the Copa del Rey in his second , and an impossible league title in his third . He took Atl\xc3\xa9tico to within a minute of the European Cup, of course \xe2\x80\x93 the one concession to the legend of El Pupas, the jinxed one.</p> <p>He even brought back the idol Fernando Torres and resuscitated him, their favourite son returning to a home that has, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cchanged completely\xe2\x80\x9d. Torres had never beaten Real Madrid as an Atl\xc3\xa9tico player. On his debut he did. Eight days later, he scored twice at the Bernab\xc3\xa9u, his first ever goals there, to knock Real out of the Copa del Rey. On Saturday afternoon he provided the assist for the fourth \xe2\x80\x93 check the scoreboard \xe2\x80\x93 fourth in the league derby against Real Madrid. Just when you think it can\xe2\x80\x99t get any better, it gets better.</p> <p>If ever there was a team against which Atl\xc3\xa9tico were measured, it is Real. When Atl\xc3\xa9tico won the Copa del Rey it was the first time they had beaten their rivals in fourteen 14 years and 25 games; they woke up every derby morning at the Cherry Street Bed and Breakfast in Punxsutawney. One banner at the Bernab\xc3\xa9u declared that they wanted a \xe2\x80\x9cdecent opponent for a worthy derby\xe2\x80\x9d. Another mocked up the TV listings for a programme on the paranormal: \xe2\x80\x9cThe incredible story of the Atl\xc3\xa9tico fan who swears he saw his team win once.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Once? This was the sixth time that Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid had played Real Madrid this season and they have not lost any of them, winning four and drawing two.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe used to be beaten before the game even started,\xe2\x80\x9d the legendary forward Jos\xc3\xa9 Eulogio G\xc3\xa1rate, who played for Atl\xc3\xa9tico for 11 years, said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow it\xe2\x80\x99s Real Madrid who get nervous.\xe2\x80\x9d The balance of power has shifted, all right. On Saturday afternoon, Real Madrid have finished a game goalless just three times this season and all three were at the Calder\xc3\xb3n. Lisbon will always hurt but Atl\xc3\xa9tico took the Spanish Super Cup off Madrid, knocked them out of the Copa del Rey and now they have done the double over them in the league \xe2\x80\x93 for the first time in 64 years.</p> <p>Nine minutes into the sixth derby of the season, a derby in which Atl\xc3\xa9tico knew that defeat would leave them out of the title race, leaving them 10 points behind their neighbours, they had a player down at both ends of the pitch. Koke had torn a muscle; Diego God\xc3\xadn had broken his nose. It did not matter. Four minutes later, Atl\xc3\xa9tico had the lead. Five minutes after that, it was two. The man who scored it was a substitute, Sa\xc3\xbal N\xc3\xadguez. Twenty-two of Atl\xc3\xa9tico\xe2\x80\x99s 24 squad members have played against Real this season, only Cerci and Cani missing out. But the result is the same. Another derby, another win.</p> <p>None, though, have been quite like this. This was the first time that Atl\xc3\xa9tico had won a league game against Real at the Calder\xc3\xb3n in almost 17 years. It was the joint second biggest victory ever achieved against their neighbours. Only once before had they won by more, and that was in 1947, and they had not scored four in a derby in 28 years, 38 at home.</p> <p>Real Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s form since the turn of the year has been frankly pretty poor, and they have lost three of their last nine, proving rather fortunate to have done that well, but this was worse. Iker Casillas let the first goal slip past him, the defence let Atl\xc3\xa9tico slip past them again and again; and in the middle, Toni Kroos could not cover the space alone, unassisted by Isco, Sami Khedira or the three men in front. As for the \xe2\x80\x9cBBC\xe2\x80\x9d, Bale, Benzema and Cristiano weren\xe2\x80\x99t even the Shopping channel. When Ronaldo\xe2\x80\x99s shot went wide on 62 minutes, it was his first and his last.</p> <p>The absentees might have made a difference: losing Sergio Ramos, Luka Modric, James Rodr\xc3\xadguez, Marcelo and Pepe did not help. But Madrid have been beaten by Atl\xc3\xa9tico with them too and their failings ran deeper. It was startling just how gutless Madrid were, like they had been beaten before the game began. Maybe fighting so hard to overturn a ban for Marcelo, as if they would somehow be sunk without him, a left-back, was not such a good idea? Maybe it exposed their own complex, their own weakness? Most of all it exposed the left side of their defence. But they were exposed everywhere.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything today; we had nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d Carlo Ancelotti admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were better than us in everything. We have to change our attitude and make sure that something like this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen again, because the lack of attitude and desire is not normal. We weren\xe2\x80\x99t in the game. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a player who played well. This was very, very bad, the worst game that Real Madrid have played since I have been on the bench.\xe2\x80\x9d The adjectives rolled in on the pages of the papers: \xe2\x80\x9cShameful\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cridiculed,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cembarrassed\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cshipwrecked\xe2\x80\x9d. Afterwards, fans offered up the now familiar analysis of what went wrong, shouting \xe2\x80\x9cput your balls into it,\xe2\x80\x9d as Real\xe2\x80\x99s players departed.</p> <p>Not that it was just about them, even if the next few days will be all about them. This was about Atl\xc3\xa9tico too. If it was Real\xe2\x80\x99s worst performance under Ancelotti, it may have been Atl\xc3\xa9tico\xe2\x80\x99s best under Simeone, along with that win at Stamford Bridge last season. Atl\xc3\xa9tico could not have beaten Real more comprehensively if they had set about them with a breeze-block-encrusted cricket bat, which is pretty much what they had been accused of in the buildup to this game. Talk had turned to Atl\xc3\xa9tico being dirty. Instead, the emptiness of that discourse was laid bare here. \xe2\x80\x9cViolent! Violent!\xe2\x80\x9d mocked the fans as their team played the ball round and those Madrid players who bothered chasing ran after it, for nothing.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cToday what we needed was football,\xe2\x80\x9d Simeone said afterwards so there was football, lots of football \xe2\x80\x93 and it was all Atl\xc3\xa9tico\xe2\x80\x99s. They were, Marca said, Ginger Rodgers and Fred Astaire dancing their way past Madrid. Afterwards Simeone explained his approach: he did not talk about effort or endeavour, about sacrifice or sweat, but about tactics. \xe2\x80\x9cIt happened exactly as he said it would,\xe2\x80\x9d Tiago noted. Atl\xc3\xa9tico hammered up the wings, the right particularly; the full-backs, Juanfran and Guilherme Siqueira, sprinted the length of the pitch, delivering cross after cross. Antoine Griezmann raced beyond the centre backs; Mario Mandzukic dominated an entire defence; Tiago seemed to ease his way through the game, completely in control alongside Gabi. Arda Turan\xe2\x80\x99s touch was sublime.</p> <p>By the end, the shots on target count read: 10-1. Real Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s one had come when it was too late. The scoreboard said 4-0 and it could have been more. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were phenomenal,\xe2\x80\x9d Iker Casillas admitted. Simeone rightly called them \xe2\x80\x9cbrilliant\xe2\x80\x9d. The papers called it a \xe2\x80\x9cbath\xe2\x80\x9d. A bath? This was Jes\xc3\xbas Gil in the Jacuzzi. The captain Gabi said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe were far better than them. Whenever you beat Madrid it\xe2\x80\x99s lovely, but beating them like this is even better.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Unique too. For all the wins against Madrid, none have been quite like this. For the first time for years, the fans knew they were going to win, able to enjoy the afternoon like never before. At the final whistle there was a standing ovation and 10 minutes after that there was another one, Atl\xc3\xa9tico back by popular demand. The supporters were not going yet; they were enjoying this too much. \xe2\x80\x9cCholo, bring them out again,\xe2\x80\x9d they chanted, so the players left the dressing room and out they came, wearing flip-flops and huge grins. Another ovation and then the fans headed down the stairs and past the scoreboard, where they paused to take a photo. A memento of a historic moment, confirmation that it really did happen.</p> <p>A few minutes later, Diego Simeone appeared in the press room with a message for the players. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you for the day you gave us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> Talking points <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\x9cLeo Messi is perfection playing football,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Athletic Bilbao manager Ernesto Valverde after his side were defeated 5-2 by Barcelona at San Mam\xc3\xa9s. It was a brilliant game, open and end-to-end, Santi Gim\xc3\xa9nez writing in AS: \xe2\x80\x9cLuis Enrique has turned a baroque choir into the Ramones ... they\xe2\x80\x99ve swapped violins for electric guitars, their hair has been let down and it\xe2\x80\x99s fun.\xe2\x80\x9d As for Messi, he was ludicrously good, vital in all five goals. Since the turn of the year he has now been directly involved, either by scoring or assisting, in 14 league goals \xe2\x80\x93 twice as many as any other player in Spain. And the stats don\xe2\x80\x99t tell the whole story either: officially he neither scored nor assisted the fifth but it was still all about him.</p> <p>There was more good news for Barcelona, with Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez scoring an excellent second and Neymar getting one too. Barcelona have now won nine in a row since that defeat against Real Sociedad, scoring 34 goals, and stand just one point behind Real Madrid at the top. \xe2\x80\x9cA little hand and one point,\xe2\x80\x9d cheered Sport. Game on.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 David Barral might just be the funniest man in Spanish football, famous for cracking jokes on Twitter \xe2\x80\x93 one in particular became famous this summer but is far, far too rude to be reproduced here. Anyway, this weekend, he scored the first hat-trick of his career as Levante, thanks to two penalties and one free kick. Oh, and some diving. It was a huge win too; \xe2\x80\x9cWe were under pressure and we could see ourselves at the bottom of the table,\xe2\x80\x9d Barral said. Disappointingly, the best he could come up with this time was a picture of him holding the ball and a single word: \xe2\x80\x9cthanks\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2Real Sociedad did it again. 1-0 up with five minutes to go against Celta, they dropped two points when Nolito scored the equaliser. It was not quite as painful as the two points dropped at Levante, but it keeps up a worrying run that is only made worse by their failure in the transfer window and the absence through injury of Carlos Vela, the player they most rely on. They are 12th and should be safe but the four teams below them are within a point and they\xe2\x80\x99re only five off the relegation zone. They\xe2\x80\x99ve won just twice in nine, three in 11 under David Moyes.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2Maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s hope at Getafe, after all. They\xe2\x80\x99ve now won two of the last three under Quique Sanchez Flores, having previously gone nine without a win. No wonder Quique was going mad at the whistle. The second goal in a 2-1 win over Sevilla was scored by Pedro Le\xc3\xb3n. It\xe2\x80\x99s more than a year since he last scored. Since then, he\xe2\x80\x99s been ditched by his club and the league, threatened by his president and kicked out the squad. Through no fault of his own. At last he\xe2\x80\x99s back in the team \xe2\x80\x93 and his contribution could yet prove colossal.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 The weekend\xe2\x80\x99s best goals might just have been in C\xc3\xb3rdoba, where Almer\xc3\xada won 1-0, their fifth win of the season, four of which have been away.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2And Villarreal scored again. Of course.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2In case you are wondering what on earth Marca were going on about, an explanation: On Saturday morning, it led with a slightly bizarre picture of eggs and salt and the headline \xe2\x80\x9cSal con huevos,\xe2\x80\x9d which means \xe2\x80\x9csalt with eggs\xe2\x80\x9d and also, handily, \xe2\x80\x9cgo out there and show you have balls.\xe2\x80\x9d Eggs, you see, is also slang for testicles.</p> <p>It all started with \xc3\x81lvaro Arbeloa saying that Diego Simeone was fortunate to have the press on side (unlike, erm, Real Madrid). \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about,\xe2\x80\x9d Simeone replied. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we\xe2\x80\x99re neighbours so next time I see him out walking the dogs I\xe2\x80\x99ll ask ...\xe2\x80\x9d To which Arbeloa this week noted: \xe2\x80\x9cHis dogs are quite a bit bigger than mine and we haven\xe2\x80\x99t crossed paths yet this week, but thankfully I have no problems with him. If he needs eggs and salt, he knows where my house is ...\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Results Deportivo 2-0 Eibar, Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid 4-0 Real Madrid, Villarreal 2-0 Granada, Levante 4-1 M\xc3\xa1laga, Real Sociedad 1-1 Celta, C\xc3\xb3rdoba 1-2 Almer\xc3\xada, Getafe 2-1 Sevilla, Espanyol 1-2 Valencia, Athletic Bilbao 2-5 Barcelona.</p> <p>Tonight Elche v Rayo</p>'
