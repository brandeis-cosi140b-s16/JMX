b'<p>Samir Nasri believes Manchester City have the mental strength to defend the Premier League title after the champions were accused of complacency by their manager Manuel Pellegrini for letting a two-goal lead slip against Burnley.</p> <p>City were held to a 2-2 draw at the Etihad on Sunday, failing to capitalise on Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s draw at Southampton, and were therefore unable to close the gap at the top to one point, with Pellegrini suggesting his players \xe2\x80\x9cthought the game was over\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Nasri also admitted his frustration at the failure to close out a what would have been a club-record 10th consecutive victory but the midfielder insists that after finishing top last May, City are far better equipped to keep pace with Chelsea this term. The season after their title in 2012 they ended up 11 points behind the winners, Manchester United.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone is stronger. We get older, we get more mature and stronger mentally. You learn to deal with different situations,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nasri. \xe2\x80\x9cAt this club we\xe2\x80\x99ve been through all the different situations. We know how to deal with the pressure. We know that we are good at being second and chasing someone. We\xe2\x80\x99ve done it before. We know how to deal with every situation and we are ready for it.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe all know what happened [in the 2012-13 season] and it\xe2\x80\x99s an example for us. We know what we need to do, what not to do as well. We learn from our mistakes. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many points we were behind United at this stage \xe2\x80\x93 we finished 11 or 12 behind them. I know this will not happen. All we want is to win the league again \xe2\x80\x93 and we\xe2\x80\x99ll do everything possible to do it again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>City will now regroup in preparation for New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day\xe2\x80\x99s game with Sunderland at the Etihad \xe2\x80\x93 a fourth match in 13 days \xe2\x80\x93 but while Nasri admitted tiredness might have played a part in letting Burnley back into the match, he refused to use it as an excuse.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe were winning 2-0 at home against a team who are playing for survival. But you have to say they played really good football \xe2\x80\x93 they were dangerous during the whole game and I have so much respect for managers who come here and try to play the game.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t play the game we needed to. Look at their team, they [Burnley] played exactly the same XI as played against Liverpool. Both teams didn\xe2\x80\x99t have many changes. Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s like this and you have to accept it. They played well \xe2\x80\x93 a draw was fair.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Edin Dzeko, meanwhile, is targeting a return from a calf problem for the trip to Everton on 10 January, a week earlier than had been anticipated.</p> <p>Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s team again started with no recognised centre-forward against Burnley due to the absence of Dzeko and Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero, who has a knee injury, with Stevan Jovetic only fit enough again to feature as a substitute following a muscle complaint.</p> <p>Dzeko last played on 10 December in the 2-0 win at Roma in what was only a second appearance following a previous calf injury that ruled him out for a month.</p> <p>With Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 due to leave City around the time of the Everton game to join up with the Ivory Coast for the Africa Cup of Nations, there is an even greater need for Pellegrini to again have Dzeko available.</p>'
