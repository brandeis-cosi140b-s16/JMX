b'Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend action'


b'1) Coutinho shows his worth to expose City\xe2\x80\x99s weakness in the market <p>Brendan Rodgers made a telling point after Liverpool inflicted a damaging defeat on Manchester City courtesy of a Philippe Coutinho winner for the second season in succession. \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa38.5m he cost us,\xe2\x80\x9d the Liverpool manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be frightening to think what he is worth in the market now.\xe2\x80\x9d Probably a sum that only a few clubs in the world can afford, the reigning Premier League champions included, but Coutinho\xe2\x80\x99s mesmerising display at Anfield invited as many questions about City\xe2\x80\x99s dealings in the transfer market as Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s forensically examined \xe2\x80\x9ctransfer committee\xe2\x80\x9d. Whereas Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s summer signings have started to vindicate the club\xe2\x80\x99s faith during the late push for Champions League qualification, City look a weaker proposition for their acquisition of \xc2\xa340m defender Eliaquim Mangala, Fernando and Bacary Sagna. Wilfried Bony, the \xc2\xa328m January signing from Swansea City, is another departure from the elite level transfers that City were making when David Silva, Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero and Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 signed up to their long-term vision.

Things could have been different early on if a moment where he was surprised by Romelu Lukaku had ended up in an Everton goal. Likewise, there was a sharp intake of breath later on when a casual sidefoot gave the ball to Aaron Lennon and prompted a dangerous Everton break. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce or twice he was surprised by the intensity of the challenges,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger. The speed of the game and his communication problems (he speaks hardly any English and not much Spanish, the squad\xe2\x80\x99s second language) are the downsides. But the upsides are encouraging. Gabriel is fast, determined, and \xe2\x80\x93 as he showed on a couple of occasions \xe2\x80\x93 he possesses the capacity for a shrewdly-timed, clean challenge in emergency situations. He enjoyed some excellent moments. A rest for Per Mertesacker has been overdue. The big German, after being given the opening game of this post-World Cup campaign off, has played 90 minutes of every Premier League game since. Weariness shows. Gabriel has a lot of different characteristics, and there may well be a clanger or two on the way as he continues adjusting to a new league, but he is ready, and hungry, to push for a regular starting position.

Yet Gus Poyet had a point when he said he prefers football the way it is and referees just need to do their jobs better. Just because American football can now stop and review almost everything does not mean association football should go down the same path. The game at Old Trafford was actually stopped for two full minutes between the penalty award and Wayne Rooney taking the spot-kick, as Roger East first waved away John O\xe2\x80\x99Shea\xe2\x80\x99s protests of Brown\xe2\x80\x99s innocence and then made contact with the fourth official without appearing to gain any practical assistance. That could only have been because Martin Atkinson had not yet seen a replay. Had the fourth official been able to avail himself of that facility \xe2\x80\x93 a simple enough matter when you have two minutes to spare \xe2\x80\x93 the issue could have been sorted out to everyone\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction.

Although Puncheon has spent most of his career as a winger, Alan Pardew spotted his potential to play as a No10 for Crystal Palace in the absence of Marouane Chamakh. Puncheon, now 28, has done well and it goes to show that it is never too late for a player to reinvent himself. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has got quality and he has that experience now and quality to stay on the ball that second longer and manoeuvre it and create something else,\xe2\x80\x9d Pardew said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been very impressed with Punch. He has improved significantly. It is very important in the Premier League to have an intelligent player with the final pass and I have evolved him into that. \xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean he is going to play there for all 12 games but it is a nice weapon for us now. The competition for wide areas here is really fierce. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t even get Dwight Gayle on the pitch today, so Dwight Gayle, Zaha, Punch, Bolasie \xe2\x80\xa6 it\xe2\x80\x99s a real lovely pool. It does give you the option to manoeuvre the team and we might even try Bolasie through the middle at some stage. You never know, you can be nicely surprised.\xe2\x80\x9d Jacob Steinberg</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: West Ham 1-3 Crystal Palace\xe2\x80\xa2 Dylan Tombides\xe2\x80\x99s heart-rending life story receives fitting tribute\xe2\x80\xa2 West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s marriage of convenience threatened by struggle for power</p>  5) Has Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s bubble finally burst? <p>We have been here before with Southampton and not very long ago. When Southampton lost five successive games between the end of November and start of December it was easy to applaud them for making such a superb start to the season and write them off in the same breath. On that occasion Southampton responded superbly, taking 16 points from the next possible 18 to prove that there was real substance to their top-four challenge. But now questions are being asked of them again after another wobble. The 1-0 defeat against West Bromwich Albion left Saints with only one goal and four points from their last five matches. Ronald Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s three-man central defence never worked \xe2\x80\x93 credit to him for accepting that was the case and discarding the system after 25 minutes \xe2\x80\x93 there was a lack of creativity and penetration to their play, and the absence of a goal threat up front \xe2\x80\x93 tied in with the form of Graziano Pell\xc3\xa8 \xe2\x80\x93 has become a genuine concern. The Italian has failed to score in his last 10 league games and the two chances that went begging at The Hawthorns \xe2\x80\x93 in particular the moment when Ryan Bertrand\xe2\x80\x99s cross slipped under his foot \xe2\x80\x93 smacked of a player woefully short of confidence, even if Koeman did his best afterwards to attribute Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s problems to the team and not an individual. Either way, Saints badly need a win against an in-form Crystal Palace side on Tuesday night to regain some momentum and prevent what has been an exceptional season so far from fading away.

R. Parker/Sportsphoto Photograph: R. Parker/Sportsphoto/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar    <p>What a diabolical week for Tottenham Hotspur. Knocked out of the Europa League at Fiorentina on Thursday, beaten in the final of the Capital One Cup on Sunday, the weekend also saw their chances of a Champions League return weaken considerably. They sat in seventh before the weekend\xe2\x80\x99s league action and remain there with a game in hand, but instead of residing three points off fourth, they are now six. Wins for Arsenal, Manchester United and, most impressively, Liverpool added salt to their gaping wound. Without a win in five in all competitions, a tired-looking team needs to rediscover a winning touch at home to Swansea on Wednesday to arrest a decline which could quickly become worrying.

Excelling against Manchester United is a different matter altogether. In the space of successive Saturdays, Jonjo Shelvey has done both. As Swansea won at Burnley, he revealed a passing range few central midfielders, other than his former Liverpool team-mate Steven Gerrard, possess. Outshining United\xe2\x80\x99s expensive talents had proved how much ability Shelvey has. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a great talent,\xe2\x80\x9d said his manager Garry Monk. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can deliver great quality. He can go as far as he wants to go. It is as simple as that.\xe2\x80\x9d The key, given Shelvey\xe2\x80\x99s chequered past, lies in consistency, in eliminating needless errors and silly suspensions. But he has flourished since he returned from a ban for elbowing Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Emre Can. Monk said Shelvey\xe2\x80\x99s attitude has been impressive. He also pointed out that he only turned 23 on Friday. He still has plenty of time to realise his huge potential.

Which is slightly worrying. The Holland right-back has created more goals than any other Newcastle player this season, largely because he is by far the best crosser of the ball at the club. While John Carver\xe2\x80\x99s reversion to 4-4-2 in the 1-0 win against Aston Villa proved broadly welcome, the system was undermined by consistently poor crossing from the two wingers, Gabriel Obertan and Sammy Ameobi. Happily Janmaat was on hand to provide the cross for Papiss Ciss\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s winner while also defending in the sort of impressive manner which explains why Mathieu Debuchy has not been missed at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park this season. Recruited from Feyenoord last summer, the arrival of Janmaat as replacement for the Arsenal-bound full-back could not have proved more seamless. The only fear now is whether the 25-year-old will start to think he can do better than settle for mid-table mediocrity on Tyneside.

The picture which emerged of his lacerated calf on Sunday morning, blood dripping down his leg, would have made even the most hardened witness of injuries wince. \xe2\x80\x9cThe tackle on Stevie Ireland could have finished his career,\xe2\x80\x9d his manager Mark Hughes said. That may be a slight overreaction but the manager was right to be furious. Former players and pundits were almost unanimous in their verdict that Maynor Figueroa had left his boot in. Whether he did or not, it once more lends credence to calls for retrospective action, or at least an investigation, can take place regardless of the referee\xe2\x80\x99s report.

Being dragged into the so-called battle for fourth is not outside the realms of possibility. They are only four points ahead of third-placed Arsenal and seven points off Liverpool in fifth. They do have a favourable couple of league games to come \xe2\x80\x93 Leicester at home and Burnley away \xe2\x80\x93 before hosting an increasingly resilient West Brom and taking a trip to Crystal Palace prior to a Manchester derby on 12 April that could go some way to deciding the destiny of both sides\xe2\x80\x99 seasons. Anything less than 10 points from the next four will see the title challenge end and could throw them into a very different fight.
