b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho wants Uefa to deduct points for FFP breaches'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has suggested clubs, Manchester City principal among them, will be wary of flouting Uefa\xe2\x80\x99s financial fair play regulations only if the governing body imposes points deductions rather than fines and restrictions on squad size for breaches of its new rules.</p> <p>City were fined around \xc2\xa350m by Uefa this year for FFP breaches \xe2\x80\x93 they will have to pay only around \xc2\xa320m if they comply with the break-even rules in future seasons \xe2\x80\x93 and had their Champions League squad capped at 21 players this season.</p> <p>Chelsea, in contrast, have actively sought to operate within the new boundaries, with their chief executive, Ron Gourlay, admitting last week that the club have to \xe2\x80\x9cchase the penny and work much harder across the business\xe2\x80\x9d rather than merely relying upon Roman Abramovich\xe2\x80\x99s funding.</p> <p>Yet Mourinho has been critical of Uefa\xe2\x80\x99s decision to impose fines on the three offenders, City, Paris Saint-Germain and Zenit St Petersburg, arguing the sanction does not act as a proper deterrent.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody knows there are fines and, if these fines exist, control exists,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Chelsea manager in an interview with Maisfutebol. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, anyway, are the fines fair? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. In my opinion the first thing to do would be to remove points and remove titles. If you have important capital which allows you to overcome financial fair play, if you win titles and then you are fined economically, you keep doing the same thing.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey will take from you one or two players from the Champions League list [shrugs]. Then, instead of 24, you go with 22. But if you\xe2\x80\x99re stating that you\xe2\x80\x99ll start the next Champions League with six points fewer, or you won\xe2\x80\x99t play in the next edition of the Champions League and will go into the Europa League instead, it is more serious.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea travel to City on Sunday seeking to extend their lead over the champions to eight points, and with a reunion with their former stalwart Frank Lampard to come. Mourinho has insisted the 36-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s chances of returning to Stamford Bridge in some capacity in the future have not been jeopardised by the midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s decision to play for City before a move to Major League Soccer next year. Lampard had departed over the summer as the London club\xe2\x80\x99s leading scorer, with 211 goals over a 13-year career, to sign for New York City only to opt to spend the next six months at the new American franchise\xe2\x80\x99s parent club.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think he has [harmed his relationship with Chelsea],\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has not with me, that\xe2\x80\x99s for sure. I still believe that what this club proposed to him, to come back when he wants and to do what he wants \xe2\x80\x93 these were the words from Mr Abramovich \xe2\x80\x93 is not in any danger.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis is just a period of his career. We thought he was going to play for New York. He decided to play for City. I was not expecting him to play for City but it was just an option and he had that right to do that. His place in Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s history is untouchable. I think, in the future, nothing has been lost. He will be back one day, I think so.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
