b'<p>David Silva wants Manchester City to avoid Barcelona and both Real and Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid in Monday\xe2\x80\x99s draw in Nyon for the Champions League last 16, though the midfielder believes that whoever they play his team can win the competition for the first time.</p> <p>City\xe2\x80\x99s 2-0 win over Roma at the Stadio Olimpico and CSKA Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s defeat at Bayern Munich took Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s side through to the knockout stage for a second consecutive season. Silva, who came on in the 67th minute against Roma following a six-week absence due to a knee injury, admitted he would like to avoid the three representatives of his homeland.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWell, I prefer anyone else. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want any one of them. The later you play a Spanish team, the better, no?\xe2\x80\x9d said Silva, whose side were knocked out of last season\xe2\x80\x99s competition by Barcelona in the round of 16. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re all that good that, if you get one, you may as well get one of the others. It\xe2\x80\x99d be a difficult draw. Every team that gets through now, they\xe2\x80\x99re difficult. No matter who we get, we have to be 100%, and have to get a little luck too.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Asked if City can claim the European Cup for a first time in the club\xe2\x80\x99s history, Silva said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we have to keep getting better. We\xe2\x80\x99ve come through a very difficult group, a very difficult game and I believe the team. The last few weeks, after the win over Bayern, I think that match gave us a lot of life. The team got a lot better, got a lot of confidence and we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to keep getting better. Any team left can win the Champions League. That\xe2\x80\x99s why they\xe2\x80\x99re here. It\xe2\x80\x99s a long and difficult road.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>City have now won their past six matches. \xe2\x80\x9cWe got a lot of confidence from that,\xe2\x80\x9d added the 28-year-old of the 3-2 home victory against Bayern. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve kept getting better. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got very good players and that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s important, that the players have confidence and give\xc2\xa0100%.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of the game against Roma, won courtesy of second-half goals from Samir Nasri and Pablo Zabaleta, Silva added: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was very difficult, but we\xe2\x80\x99re happy and we got through because we started to play again. The truth is it was a great feat in the cycle of this team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Nasri\xe2\x80\x99s 60th-minute strike wrested the contest the English champions\xe2\x80\x99 way and despite the side\xe2\x80\x99s struggles in Group E \xe2\x80\x93 and at the start of the domestic campaign \xe2\x80\x93 the Frenchman believes City are one of the best teams in the world.</p> <p>Nasri was initially reluctant to be drawn on the potential of the team, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll let you judge it.\xe2\x80\x9d But he added: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be biased. For me, we have one of the best teams in the world. We just have to show it. I think, when you go through, with all the difficulties we had, it\xe2\x80\x99s a miracle, with two points after four games, and you still have a chance to qualify. But we did it and I think we can go as far as possible. But we have to be lucky in the draw.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Despite his side\xe2\x80\x99s rising confidence and the manner of the victory, Nasri understands that when the competition resumes next year certain variables could affect City\xe2\x80\x99s chances. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too early to talk about it. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many injuries we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have in February or if everyone will be at their best,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLast year we had the same number of points as Bayern Munich after the group stage, and everyone was confident because Barcelona were not at their best.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>City have not always played at their peak but are in the last 16 and only three points behind Chelsea as they attempt to defend their Premier League title. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xc2\xa0just think you want too much from us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nasri. \xe2\x80\x9cA week ago everyone was comparing them [Chelsea] to the Invincibles from Arsenal, everyone saying they were unbeatable and stuff like that, then it means we are not that bad.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe thing is last season we were smashing every team 6-1, 6-0, 5-0, but everyone has studied all the teams, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the same any more. And you have a couple of injured players and a couple of key players who are not at their best, so, you know, we just show that as a team we can perform.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>City are likely to be boosted imminently by confirmation of new contracts for Joe Hart and James Milner. Hart said: \xe2\x80\x9cAs far as I am aware it is pretty much sorted. I leave it to the legal side to sort but I am very happy at this club and hopefully in the near future I will be signing that contract.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Milner, whose current terms end in the summer and who had been considering leaving in search of more game time, said: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s talks going on so hopefully it will be sorted soon.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
