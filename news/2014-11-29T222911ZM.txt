b'Manuel Pellegrini wants Frank Lampard to stay at Manchester City'


b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini has dropped the strongest hint yet that Manchester City would like Frank Lampard to extend his loan beyond December. The former Chelsea midfielder is due to join New York City next month but has been unexpectedly influential at the Etihad \xe2\x80\x93 he was outstanding against Bayern Munich in midweek when Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero\xe2\x80\x99s hat-trick stole the headlines \xe2\x80\x93 and City might now be reluctant to let him go.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to talk to all the parties and make a decision in December,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf all parties agree then maybe we can keep him, but it could be that we want to keep him and Frank wants to go.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>That seems unlikely, at least as long as City are still in the Champions League. If their European campaign ends with a group stage exit in Rome on 10 December Lampard might decide to take up his new challenge in America, but if City qualify for the knockout stages he is thought to be receptive to staying on.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI thought my Champions League days were over but I really enjoyed playing against a top-class team,\xe2\x80\x9d Lampard said after the victory over Bayern Munich. \xe2\x80\x9cRome will be another tough game but if we can get through the group then you can recharge in the new year and it\xe2\x80\x99s always a bit different then.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Lampard has a good chance of playing in Rome because Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 will still be suspended, but though Pellegrini refuses to look any further ahead, it seems clear he will be exploring the possibility of extending the loan. \xe2\x80\x9cI speak to Frank every day and I have the impression that he is playing better every day,\xe2\x80\x9d the City manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am certainly very happy with the loan so far.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>City could move into second place behind Chelsea with a win at Southampton on Sunday, though Ronald Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s team are above them and Pellegrini is aware that any sort of slip will only add to the view that Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s team cannot be caught. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why there is such a perception,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI agree that if Chelsea continue as they have started and keep it up until the end of the season, they will win the title, but who knows whether that will happen? I know there is a gap to make up, but this time last year we were six points behind Arsenal and no one was talking about us.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone was saying Arsenal were going to win the league and in the end they finished fourth. That might not happen to Chelsea, if they only drop four points from their next four games they will most likely be champions, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t predict the future and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how anyone else can.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As with Lampard, Pellegrini is also pleased with Ag\xc3\xbcero, a player he revealed he once tried to bring from Argentina to Villarreal, and a striker who will soon be attracting the interest of the game\xe2\x80\x99s biggest spenders if he continues the sort of form that turned the game around against Bayern. \xe2\x80\x9cSergio is happy here and he has five or six more years on his contract,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is still young [26] and he has at least five more years left where he is at his top level of performance.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cCity is not a club that sells its best players. At this moment Sergio doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go and we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to sell him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In 2003, Ag\xc3\xbcero broke a record set by Diego Maradona when he made his first appearance in Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s Primera Division, playing for Independiente aged 15 years and 35 days. Pellegrini was managing River Plate at the time and remembered him when he moved to Spain to following year. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone could see he would be a very good player because it was not normal to see someone so young playing so well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI tried to buy him for Villarreal but I can\xe2\x80\x99t say we ever got close. Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid were in before us and they had more money.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
