b'Sydney FC 0-1 Tottenham Hotspur: post-season friendly \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>Well it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really a thriller, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the goal-fest I expected either, but it was a decent enough game and the man of the moment hit the winning goal, which is what Spurs fans wanted to see. You can\xe2\x80\x99t really ask for much more from a friendly.</p> <p>As for Sydney, as I said in the report, they can hold their heads up after matching Spurs for large chunks of the game. OK, Tottenham weren\xe2\x80\x99t exactly going full throttle, but Sydney still had to raise their game to keep pace with the visitors, which suggests there\xe2\x80\x99s more to come from Graham Arnold\xe2\x80\x99s men next season.</p> <p>Anyway, that\xe2\x80\x99s me done for the night. Catch you on Tuesday for the Chelsea match.</p>'
