b'Football transfer rumours: Liverpool to rival Arsenal for Luiz Adriano?'


b'<p>Juventus have sensationally opened the door to another four months of interminable Paul Pogba-based rumourmongering by revealing the French midfielder, despite signing a four-year contract with the Turin-based giants but a matter of weeks ago, could leave this summer if he really wants to. \xe2\x80\x9cPogba is still master of his own destiny,\xe2\x80\x9d their director Giuseppe Marotta said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he chooses to leave then it will be hard to keep him.\xe2\x80\x9d So far so good, though Marotta also insists that \xe2\x80\x9che\xe2\x80\x99s given no sign that he wants to go away\xe2\x80\x9d. But since when has that stopped us, eh?</p> <p>If Pogba remains in Italy, he could well be joined at Joventus by Edin Dzeko, who according to the Mirror are \xe2\x80\x9cincreasingly confident\xe2\x80\x9d they can pip Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid to seal a \xc2\xa315m summer deal for the Manchester City striker. Talking of Atleti, Manchester United have agreed terms with Valencia\xe2\x80\x99s Nicol\xc3\xa1s Otamendi, according to the Metro \xe2\x80\x93 although their source is apparently an article in a Spanish newspaper that is largely about how Atl\xc3\xa9tico want to sign the Valencia defender, and insists that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Otamendi saga has only just begun\xe2\x80\x9d. And if there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing the Mill likes better than a juicy bit of transfer gossip, it\xe2\x80\x99s a juicy bit of transfer gossip that it will be able to repeat with minor tweaks and variations for several wonderful months.</p> <p>Chelsea are going to sign Valencia\xe2\x80\x99s Andr\xc3\xa9 Gomes, and have already tabled a \xc2\xa325.7m bid for the Portuguese midfielder. He may get to Stamford Bridge too late to meet Petr Cech, who has been told he can go wherever he likes if he ends up leaving this summer, even if he picks one of the club\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League rivals. Liverpool and Arsenal are both among the bench-bound shot-stopper\xe2\x80\x99s admirers, and could meet his club\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa310m asking price, though the 32-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on a three-year contract could rule out the notoriously ageist Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger.</p> <p>The battle for Cech is but one of (at least) three that will pit Arsenal against Liverpool this summer, with the clubs set to duel for the Shakhtar Donetsk striker Luiz Adriano, whose contract runs until December whereupon, he admits, \xe2\x80\x9cit will be difficult to stay in Ukraine\xe2\x80\x9d, while the Telegraph reveals that Liverpool have joined the Gunners in the chase for Internazionale\xe2\x80\x99s Croatian whizzkid Mateo Kovacic.</p> <p>Manchester United could also be in the market for a new goalkeeper, should David de Gea be stolen away from Old Trafford by Real Madrid, and have decided that Stoke\xe2\x80\x99s Asmir Begovic would fit the bill rather nicely. In further goalkeeping news, Hull fancy having another go at signing Malmo\xe2\x80\x99s Robin Olsen, who they failed to tempt to England in the January transfer window but who has since become even more attractive, being as he is on the verge of Bosman-free-transfer-qualification. And in absolutely final goalkeeping news, in their big transfer exclusive of the day the Express reveal Dundee United\xe2\x80\x99s Radoslaw Cierzniak has emerged as a big summer target for Limassol, the seventh-best side in Cyprus.</p> <p>Everton will sign on-loan Tottenham wingman Aaron Lennon on a permanent deal in the summer if he keeps on playing well, with Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez admitting having him around \xe2\x80\x9cpleases me a lot\xe2\x80\x9d, and considering spending \xc2\xa36m to keep him for good. Doing a less good job of impressing during a loan spell is Alex Song, with West Ham deciding not to complete a long-term deal for their borrowed Barcelona midfielder on the grounds that he isn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly good (though cynics will say that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped them in the past).</p> <p>Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s Neil Taylor is a popular young man, being chased as he is by three Premier League clubs in the shape of Newcastle, Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion after he put off discussions over a new contract until the end of the season. Southampton want \xc2\xa35m-rated Feyenoord midfielder Tonny Vilhena, who popped over for \xe2\x80\x9csecret talks\xe2\x80\x9d earlier this month. In other news that didn\xe2\x80\x99t really go anywhere else so we suppose might as well go here, Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s Anthony Knockaert is in discussions with Standard Li\xc3\xa8ge over a summer freebie switch, and Charlie Adam says he\xe2\x80\x99s definitely not going to Real Sociedad.</p> <p>Finally, the Sun exclusively reveal that when such as Dennis Wise and Jody Morris wanted to use the Chelsea training-ground toilet back in their playing days, they would make John Terry sit on it first so the seat was nice and warm for their sensitive derri\xc3\xa8res. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d do anything for them \xe2\x80\x93 make their tea and coffee, even silly things like sit on the toilet to make the seat warm for them in the cold winter days at the training ground,\xe2\x80\x9d the current Chelsea captain admits. \xe2\x80\x9cI had players like Wisey, Kevin Hitchcock and Michael Duberry to look up to and they looked after me. It meant a lot. These players enabled me to be me.\xe2\x80\x9d Now, of course, the club have bred their own colony of extra-warm toilet-dwarves to do the job instead.</p>'
