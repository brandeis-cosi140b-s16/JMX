b'Football transfer rumours: Manchester United to beat Arsenal to Gabriel?'


b'<p>Hello. How are you? Feeling good? Chipper? Full of beans? Jumping around the place like a giddy little puppy? Waving your hands in the air like you just don\xe2\x80\x99t care? Good \xe2\x80\x93 and rightly so, because \xe2\x80\x99tis the season for unbridled joy, the time when us football fans walk with a little skip in our step and a glint in our eye. It\xe2\x80\x99s the transfer window, and boy are we excited.</p> <p>How could you not be thrilled each and every morning when the Rumour Mill plops on to your electronic doormat, bringing you news that David de Gea\xe2\x80\x99s agent, the venerable Jorge Mendes, has refused \xe2\x80\x93 point blank, straight up, no apologies refused \xe2\x80\x93 to rule out a move for his man to Real Madrid? What larks!</p> <p>And how about tell that Gabriel Paulista, who actually should probably just be referred to as Gabriel but you absolutely know that people are going to call him Paulista anyway, could be the subject of a tug o\xe2\x80\x99 war/mud-wrestle between Arsenal and Manchester United, the latter apparently impishly trying to gazump the former\xe2\x80\x99s move for the defender they so desperately needed. Scenes!</p> <p>Get this \xe2\x80\x93 QPR have been offered Alexandre Pato, who you\xe2\x80\x99ll remember as the lad once thought to be the saviour of our souls/be quite good at football. The world\xe2\x80\x99s first duck/boy hybrid has been kicking it in Brazil since leaving Milan a couple of years back, first at Corinthians and now with S\xc3\xa3o Paulo, but is now being offered around town like a knock-off DVD in a pub, and if anyone is going to take up an offer like that, it\xe2\x80\x99s Harry. Gadzooks!</p> <p>Speaking of Brazilian flairsters of whom much was thought but hasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite turned into a world-beater, Chelsea are apparently sniffing around Douglas Costa, currently doing his thing for Shakhtar Donetsk but whose thing Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho thinks would fit right in down Stamford Bridge. One man he won\xe2\x80\x99t be playing with is Mohamed Salah, whose move to Chelsea has been a roaring success in the same way that Roman Abramovich is a garrulous raconteur, joyously recounting tale after tale to anyone who\xe2\x80\x99ll listen and keeping everyone up way past their bedtimes with his stories. Anyway, Salah is off to Roma, who are trying to persuade Chelsea to basically give him away.</p> <p>Salah might be filed in the same \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, that winger Chelsea bought and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t really work out for them\xe2\x80\x9d box as Kevin De Bruyne, but apparently the Dutchman, who now plays for Wolfsburg, misses life in England and wants to come back \xe2\x80\x93 Arsenal and Manchester United are keen, so the runes say.</p> <p>And on the winger tip, it says in these tip-top transfer tales that Aaron Lennon will be doing one from Spurs shortly, with Hull keener than most to take him off their hands, while Manchester City have signed up to Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s Jay Rodriguez newsletter, so that they can be kept abreast of all developments from the currently broken forward/winger. Presumably because they want to buy him, but maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s just that they\xe2\x80\x99re such nice guys they just want to make sure he\xe2\x80\x99s OK.</p> <p>Javier Hern\xc3\xa1ndez is on loan at Real Madrid but the word around the campfire is that he won\xe2\x80\x99t be making that a more permanent arrangement, deciding that life on the bench in Spain isn\xe2\x80\x99t significantly better than life on the bench in England.</p> <p>And finally, spoilsport Brendan Rodgers has clearly misunderstood the point of the transfer window, which is to get players moving, moving, moving, as he expects Raheem Sterling to sign a new contract at Liverpool shortly. Bah, Brendan \xe2\x80\x93 bah. Stop trying to harsh our buzz.</p>'
