b'The Fiver: The Round of Arsenal and The Stadium of 16 | Scott Murray'


b'BIG CUP, REPETITIVE? NO! NO NO NO. NO NO NO NO NO. <p>The old European Cup, as was, would have gotten stale had the clever folk at Uefa not been the sort of creative, innovative, admirable go-getters who keep things moving forward all the time. All those clubs, big and small, building teams to win a national championship before embarking on a parlous campaign that hangs on a gossamer thread, in grave peril of ending at any given moment as a result of just one tiny mistake, players always working on the assumption that they only have one shot at glory (given the high barriers to entry and percentage chance of winning another league to qualify again) yet delivering under extreme pressure nonetheless? Well, all that had to go! Now, thanks to new improved Big Cup, the same clubs reach the same knockout stages year after year after year after year after year, achieving pretty much exactly the same thing, which in the majority of cases is sweet fanny all, though it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter as they\xe2\x80\x99ll be back again next time for another half-arsed pop and their cheque. Well done, Uefa! A radical and much-needed overhaul.</p> <p>But Uefa isn\xe2\x80\x99t so smug and self-satisfied that it\xe2\x80\x99ll not continue to make tweaks and improvements whenever it can. Always thinking, you see. And so next year another big change might be in order. This is because they\xe2\x80\x99ve never quite got round to thinking of a snappy title for the first knockout round. First it was called Second Round, then it was First Knockout Round, and for the past four years it\xe2\x80\x99s been known as The Round of Arsenal. But that monicker could suddenly be made to look very out of date very soon, with the Gunners hot favourites to advance to the quarter finals for once. This is because they\xe2\x80\x99ve drawn Monaco, who they face tonight at the Stadium of 16. Monaco will be tough to break down, having conceded only one goal in their six Big Cup matches so far, and a mere three in their past 17 games. But Arsenal should have plenty of time and opportunity to work out how to pick the lock, with the serenity of a pensioner mulling over an extreme sudoku puzzle, because the French side have only scored four times in Big Cup this season, and 25 in their last 26. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got Dimitar Berbatov doing the pressing, see.</p> <p>Monaco - the actual grubby tax bolthole - is of course a principality. But Monaco - the football club - can make no similar claim to royalty. Arsenal will be pleased about this, having drawn Barcelona (four Big Cup wins), Milan (seven), Bayern Munich (five) and Bayern Munich (five, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t in fairness count those again) at this stage in the past four years. Monaco by comparison have only reached one final, and failed to win that. Which admittedly is also Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s record, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve made it this far 15 years in a row now, while Monaco haven\xe2\x80\x99t been here for a decade, and that\xe2\x80\x99s surely got to count for something. So even though Jack Wilshere is not available tonight, presumably because he\xe2\x80\x99s got a fag on, the Gunners should find themselves after this leg within touching distance of the quarters. Which will in turn necessitate Uefa renaming the Round of 16, presumably after a certain club in powder-blue shirts from the north-west.</p> LIVE BIG CUP ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT! <p>Follow Arsenal 1-1 Monaco with Scott Murray and Bayer Leverkusen 1-3 Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid with Ian McCourt from 7.45pm GMT.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY I <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was just playing with him. He began to curse me and I ended up mocking him. What he told me? I can not repeat it, no. My mother gave me an education. What his mother did not tell him, my mother taught me\xe2\x80\x9d - Neymar suggests he had a better upbringing than the Wildean Manchester City fan who taunted him in the wake of Leo Messi\xe2\x80\x99s penalty miss at the Etihad.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: Swansea dealing with director John van Zweden \xe2\x80\x98internally and appropriately\xe2\x80\x99 for calling Louis van Gaal an \xe2\x80\x98arrogant b@stard\xe2\x80\x99 on Dutch TV (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Bits and Bobs). I assume this means they will congratulate him for his observation skills and his ability to state the blindingly obvious while asking him to refrain from demonstrating them on TV in future. That would seem to be an appropriate response to me.\xe2\x80\x9d - Brendan Mackinney.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAfter being alerted to the existence of Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s Ben Mee throughout this season and again this weekend due to his prevalence on Match of the Day, I did a little digging and discovered that he was brought up in a rather diverse and international household alongside his foreign, adopted brother and sister, Shape Mee and Annie-Weiyu-Wan Mee. Reports of a sibling named Aslongasyouneed Mee are currently unconfirmed. If there is an award for most convoluted pun ever forwarded to the Fiver, then this stands a good chance\xe2\x80\x9d - Adam Jackson.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs a long-time appreciator of the Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s keen sense of patriotism I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but wonder why, in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s article \xe2\x80\x98No Ho Ho\xe2\x80\x99, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t pointed out that the biggest beneficiary of Sepp Blatter\xe2\x80\x99s Winter World Cup\xe2\x84\xa2 will be Team England. By putting the tournament halfway through the season, Sepp has inadvertently given a huge boost to those players who have historically underperformed at the World Cup (read: England players) because they have spent an entire season giving 110% on wet and windy Tuesday nights in Stoke without so much as a Christmas Day off. Now that the tournament begins in November, we\xe2\x80\x99re finally on an even keel with the winter-breakers! I\xe2\x80\x99ll contact David and Frank so they can get updating the Three Lions lyrics in preparation\xe2\x80\x9d - Matt Smith.</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@guardian.co.uk.
