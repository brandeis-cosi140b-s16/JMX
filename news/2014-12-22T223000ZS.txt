b'Steven Taylor: Newcastle can make up for derby loss at Manchester United'


b'<p>Steven Taylor has appealed to Newcastle United\xe2\x80\x99s disgruntled supporters, asking them to keep faith with Alan Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s team in the wake of a fourth straight Tyne-Wear derby defeat against Sunderland.</p> <p>Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 1-0 reverse at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park means Pardew has become the first Newcastle manager to concede four consecutive north-east derbies but Taylor and his team-mates are desperate to compensate at Manchester United on Boxing Day.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPlease stick with us,\xe2\x80\x9d said the centre-half as he contemplated the fallout from Adam Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s 90th-minute winner. \xe2\x80\x9cThis has hurt \xe2\x80\x93 and we are going to try to make up for it at Old Trafford. It was a horrible feeling coming off the pitch. We were devastated. The lads are hurting, the fans are hurting but we can\xe2\x80\x99t dwell on it \xe2\x80\x93 we have to put it right at Manchester United.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s side have already beaten Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool this season and they won at Old Trafford last year, but Taylor knows repeating that feat will not be straightforward.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to be difficult with the players they have like Rooney, Van Persie and Di Mar\xc3\xada,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have top-class players all over the pitch but we will give it our best. We will need everyone putting their bodies on the line and hopefully redeem the derby.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe can recover. It will be touch-and-go at Manchester United but we\xe2\x80\x99ve proved we can do it against the big boys. Hopefully it will be a turning point for us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Taylor arguably exceeded the call of duty when an attempted headed clearance resulted in his colliding with a post and requiring stitches near an eye. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite a hard post,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it definitely won. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a bit of a headache but I\xe2\x80\x99m more devastated about losing to Sunderland. It hurts.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a disappointing result but we weren\xe2\x80\x99t clinical. I think we probably deserved a draw but we ended up getting done on the counterattack from our own set piece.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t get many chances but in the first half we played straight into their hands, giving, I think, seven free-kicks away. If there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing you can\xe2\x80\x99t do against a Sunderland side with a back four all over 6ft 2in, it\xe2\x80\x99s that, because it just makes defending difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pardew had warned his players they would be particularly vulnerable if Sunderland broke from a set play only to watch in horror as Gus Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s team counterattacked following a late home corner and Johnson scored.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d looked at it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Taylor. \xe2\x80\x9cWe knew they would be a risk from our own set pieces and that is exactly what happened. We have to address that situation because it can\xe2\x80\x99t happen again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Despite a result which in previous years could well have provoked ugly post-match scenes, Northumbria police were delighted a truce between rival fans held, while their new, more mature \xe2\x80\x9csoftly, softly\xe2\x80\x9d approach to crowd control proved a success. Only 17 arrests were made on an overwhelmingly good-natured afternoon which passed without major incident or significant disruption. Chief superintendent Steve Neill, the match commander, subsequently thanked both sets of supporters for their \xe2\x80\x9cpatience and cooperation\xe2\x80\x9d.</p>'
