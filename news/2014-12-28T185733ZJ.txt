b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho calls F\xc3\xa0bregas\xe2\x80\x99s card for dive at Southampton \xe2\x80\x98a scandal\xe2\x80\x99'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho could face a charge for misconduct from the Football Association after he was unable to contain his fury about Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas\xe2\x80\x99s booking for diving in Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s 1-1 draw at Southampton, labelling Anthony Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s failure to award his side a penalty a scandal and saying the referee should be ashamed about his decision.</p> <p>Mourinho, whose mood was likely to have been improved by Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s failure to close the gap at the top of the table to a point after they drew 2-2 at home with Burnley, went on to add that his team are being unfairly targeted because a campaign is being waged against them after F\xc3\xa0bregas became the fifth Chelsea player in the past month to become embroiled in a diving controversy. F\xc3\xa0bregas appeared to be caught by Matt Targett in the Southampton area in the second half but the referee decided otherwise.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn other countries where I worked, tomorrow in the sports papers it would be front-page scandal because it is a scandal,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it is a scandal because it is not a small penalty \xe2\x80\x93 it is a penalty like Big Ben. In this country \xe2\x80\x93 and I am happy with that, more than happy with that \xe2\x80\x93 we will just say that it was a big mistake with a big influence in the result. I will go to the referee and wish him a good year and tell him he will be ashamed.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho believes that his players are suffering the consequences of criticism from outside the club, pointing to Diego Costa\xe2\x80\x99s booking for a dive against Burnley in August. Steve Bruce accused Gary Cahill of diving in Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s win over Hull City a fortnight ago, a game in which Costa and Willian were booked for simulation, while Sam Allardyce was equally critical of Branislav Ivanovic after his tumble against West Ham United on Boxing Day.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think it is clearly the result of something that looks like a campaign,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the first match, Diego got a yellow card when it should have been a penalty and a red card at Burnley. A few months later, we lose two points in a match where the penalty is there and F\xc3\xa0bregas gets a yellow card.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAgainst West Ham, [Enner] Valencia made a very bad dive at the end of the game and Sam is talking about Ivanovic. What is this? What? Why? Which intention? And today you come here, crucial decision. One of these matches between two good teams, difficult match, crucial decisions and the ref makes a wrong decision.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho said that he does not know who was responsible for the apparent campaign but questioned why there is not\xc2\xa0as much scrutiny when his players are on the end of bad tackles or when their rivals receive favourable decisions.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not against me because I am not on the pitch, but against Chelsea,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the last couple of weeks, do you want me to tell you the two most important things that happened in my matches? Filipe Lu\xc3\xads and Eden Hazard could have broken legs.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey could be in hospital now with broken legs and you are speaking now about Gary Cahill against Hull City when the result was 2-0 and you are speaking about West Ham when the result was 2-0 and should be 5-0.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut you also forget other things. Man City v Crystal Palace, a goal is not offside, you don\xe2\x80\x99t speak a lot about it. Man United v Newcastle, 0-0, penalty and a red card for Mata \xe2\x80\x93 no penalty. So you don\xe2\x80\x99t speak about other things.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho added that it should be possible for yellow cards for diving to be eradicated if the referee accepts he has made a mistake, while F\xc3\xa0bregas was also damning of Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s decision. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was definitely contact,\xe2\x80\x9d the Spaniard said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe referee didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the best game of his life and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he will sleep that well tonight. He had an awful game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The consolation for Chelsea, who hope to have Oscar back from illness when they visit Tottenham Hotspur on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, is that they remain three points ahead of City.</p> <p>Southampton ended the game with 10 men after Morgan Schneiderlin\xe2\x80\x99s late red card for two bookings but the draw kept them in fourth place. They took the lead through Sadio Man\xc3\xa9 in the first half, only for Eden Hazard to equalise on the stroke of half-time.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOne point against Chelsea may be three points against another opponent,\xe2\x80\x9d the Southampton manager, Ronald Koeman, said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe learn from the mistakes in the past. If we keep going like this, we can fight for a high position.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
