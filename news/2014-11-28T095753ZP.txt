b'Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend'


b'1) The beginning of the end of Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s run <p>Scoring a hat-trick against Bayern Munich is all well and good, but how will Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero fare upon being confronted by the tightest defence in the Premier League? Aston Villa found a way through on Monday night, so you\xe2\x80\x99d fancy the Argentinian to emulate them in what promises to be an entertaining and revealing game.</p> <p>Having shipped just six goals in their opening 12 matches, the pre-season relegation favourites embark on a fascinating run of matches that pits them against Manchester City (home), Arsenal (away) and Manchester United (home). The results ought to leave us in very little doubt about Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s status as genuine top four contenders and reveal plenty more about just how far some of the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s mighty have fallen.

Those five players have been key to West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s fine start to the season and their line-up had a rather more workmanlike feel to it without them. Sam Allardyce played five at the back, Kevin Nolan was handed his first start since October in midfield and Andy Carroll, starting for the first time this season after his return from an ankle injury, was partnered by Carlton Cole in attack. Yet despite those misgivings, West Ham were surprisingly adventurous, especially after the introduction of Mauro Z\xc3\xa1rate and Matt Jarvis in the second half, and were unfortunate not to pick up at least a draw. Allardyce was disappointed that they were caught on the break when Leon Osman scored Everton\xe2\x80\x99s late winner but at least his squad players did not disgrace themselves; it was a solid performance.</p>     Andy Carroll could feature for West Ham against former club Newcastle this weekend. Photograph: Matthew Lewis/Getty Images    <p>However the depth of West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s squad will be tested again against Newcastle United, who have risen above Allardyce\xe2\x80\x99s side and into fifth place after a run of form that few people saw coming when the knives were out for Alan Pardew at the start of the season. \xe2\x80\x9cWith the form and momentum they have I think they\xe2\x80\x99re the hardest to team to face right now, aside from Chelsea,\xe2\x80\x9d Allardyce said and he will shudder when he recalls how Newcastle outclassed West Ham at Upton Park last season. Allardyce expects Downing and Kouyat\xc3\xa9 to return but he is less certain about Sakho, Song and Valencia, while Mark Noble is also a doubt, which will increase the pressure on some of the lesser lights in West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s squad. Come to think of it, the visit of Newcastle would be a good time for Carroll to remind us of the qualities that convinced West Ham to spend \xc2\xa315m on him last summer.

It was a season-defining result for both teams, but only Chelsea seem to have learned much from it and it seems inconceivable that their apparently relentless march to the title will be interrupted at the Stadium of Light this weekend.</p> <p>Having lost to Sunderland in two out of three matches last season, Chelsea will be anxious to put this match to bed as early as possible and all available evidence suggests that their hosts will be able to do very little to stop them. Having now failed to score against all three promoted sides, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to see them troubling the second meanest defence in the league. Steven Fletcher has shown signs of life with four goals scored in two matches a month apart, while Connor Wickham has followed up his heroics towards the end of last season with a return of just one goal in 12 and Jozy Altidore is ... well, a player clearly in need of a fresh start elsewhere. By all accounts, the American is a tremendously nice bloke but mystery continues to surround his role at Sunderland. If he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t score, can\xe2\x80\x99t run particularly fast and isn\xe2\x80\x99t great at holding up the ball and linking play, then what is the American actually for?</p>           Chelsea is Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s biggest challenge, says Gus Poyet    <p>Chelsea conceded just shy of one goal per game on average, so statistics suggest there\xe2\x80\x99s a fair chance Seb Larsson might find his range or at some point the ball could take a lucky deflection and ricochet past Thibaut Courtois off John Terry\xe2\x80\x99s backside. But with Chelsea playing so well, Diego Costa in such imperious form and the memory of that 8-0 humiliation at the hands of Southampton still fresh in their memories, Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s players must be genuinely fearful of the horrors that could unfold. The fixture generator has decreed that these sides will meet again at Stamford Bridge on the final day of the season. On a May afternoon that\xe2\x80\x99s currently odds on to end in the coronation as champions of the hosts, unless their strikers stop firing blanks there\xe2\x80\x99s a fair chance Sunderland will end it mired in the depths of relegation despair.

Delve deeper and you\xe2\x80\x99ll find more. There was that time Stoke City decided to make \xe2\x80\x9can official complaint\xe2\x80\x9d about him. There was the occasion Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers \xe2\x80\x9crounded\xe2\x80\x9d on him. And who will forget the recent evening he got \xe2\x80\x9ccaught up in shocking violence\xe2\x80\x9d while simply trying to do his job on a politically charged night in Belgrade?</p>     Is Martin Atkinson paid enough when you consider the abuse he and other referees endure every week? Photograph: Matt Bunn/BPI/REX    <p>A similar search may make for even more unpleasant reading after Atkinson travels to the Liberty Stadium and refs the match between Swansea City and Crystal Palace, clubs managed by two of the moaniest official-baiters in the Premier League. While among the worst, they are by no means the only offenders and just last weekend we were treated to the comical sight of Hull City manager Steve Bruce complaining about a refereeing decision made by Craig Pawson despite acknowledging it was correct.</p> <p>Like all Premier League referees, Martin Atkinson gets paid a \xc2\xa340,000 per annum retainer and \xc2\xa31,200 per match. Over a season, that amounts to around \xc2\xa385,000 per man, of which each takes home about \xc2\xa356,000 after tax. With so many Britons suffering financial hardship, only a Tory front-bencher would lightly dismiss such a sum as modest, but for all the abuse to which referees are subjected it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem very much. Perhaps players, managers and supporters should be more understanding of the fallibility of match officials, before they arrive at the conclusion there are easier and less stressful ways of making far more money. BG</p> 5) Will faith in Van Persie waver? <p>The speed of Robin van Persie\xe2\x80\x99s decline since he led Manchester United to the title two seasons ago has been a sight to behold. Where once the mere presence of Van Persie would be enough to convince opponents that United were starting matches with a one-goal lead, he has become so ineffective now that there are matches when you have to remind yourself that he is on the pitch and it is becoming a problem for Louis van Gaal, although the truth is that the striker was starting to slow noticeably towards the end of his first year at Old Trafford. Van Persie scored 23 goals in his first 31 games for United but only seven in his next 17 \xe2\x80\x93 and two of those were penalties and one should have been ruled out for offside. A pattern was forming. Van Persie struggled with injuries last season before tailing off after a good start to the World Cup and now he simply looks too slow. He can still finish, as he has shown from time to time this season, but he contributed little during an invisible performance in last weekend\xe2\x80\x99s victory over Arsenal. Van Persie\xe2\x80\x99s class is not in doubt and his movement is sharp and efficient when he is at the best but United are carrying him at the moment. How long before Van Gaal gives James Wilson a chance?

Or is it a case that the repeated mistakes being made by the gaffe prone defenders in front of him are down to a lack of confidence on their part in the goalkeeper behind them? Of course, these scenarios need not be mutually exclusive and Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s many defensive shortcomings could well be rooted in a combination of both. Now manager Brendan Rodgers could go some way towards finding out by giving his reserve keeper Brad Jones a run in the side. Having cost his team yet another goal with yet another rick on Wednesday night, Simon Mignolet wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be human if his confidence was unaffected. He might be glad of the break and his absence could prove revealing.

Photograph: Matthew Ashton/AMA/Corbis    <p>Mauricio Pochettino has suggested that teams in the Europa League should be given an extra day\xe2\x80\x99s rest and play their Premier League matches on Monday instead of Sunday. It is not hard to see why the Tottenham Hotspur manager thinks that given that his team have lost four of their six league matches after playing in the Europa League, despite playing each of them at home. Tottenham were stuffed by Liverpool in August and dozed through subsequent defeats against Newcastle, Stoke and West Brom; Southampton and Queens Park Rangers have been their only victims after they have filled a slot for ITV4 on a Thursday night. Yet it could be different this when Tottenham host Everton on Sunday. Everton played Wolfsburg away on Thursday night and their record is not much better than Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s: Roberto Martinez\xe2\x80\x99s side have won once, drawn once and lost twice after playing in Europe. Something has to give. JS</p>  <li>Europa League match report: Tottenham 1-0 Partizan</li> <li>Spurs face inquiry after pitch invaders force players off</li> <li>Europa League match report: Wolfsburg 0-2 Everton</li> <li>Mart\xc3\xadnez defends Barkley against diving claims</li> <li>Everton and West Ham charged over Goodison Park melee</li>  8) Can Leicester stop the rot? <p>Oh, Leicester! What were you thinking of when you humbled Manchester United in September? They have had a miserable time since then. They have not won, losing five of their past seven matches and scoring only twice during that run, and Nigel Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s side have slipped into the bottom three as a result of their dreadful run. The curious thing is that nothing about the way Leicester started the season suggested that this was coming. In their first five matches, they drew with Arsenal and Everton, beat United 5-3 at home, won at Stoke and frustrated Chelsea for long periods before succumbing in the second half. Yet the goals have dried up. Leandro Ulloa has stopped scoring and they were bereft of inspiration against Sunderland last weekend. Leicester will be desperate to get back on track against Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road but Harry Redknapp\xe2\x80\x99s side will fancy themselves if Charlie Austin is in the mood. JS</p>  <li>Rio Ferdinand: My family values</li>  9) Is Giroud ready? <p>Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s victory over Borussia Dortmund came at a price, with Mikel Arteta and Yaya Sanogo becoming the latest players to join their ever-bulging injury list. It was rotten luck for Sanogo to damage a hamstring on the night when he scored his first Arsenal goal and it could mean that Olivier Giroud, who could not play against Dortmund because he was not registered for the Champions League, will start at West Bromwich Albion if Danny Welbeck is still nursing a knee problem. Giroud scored a stunner when he came off the bench against Manchester United but after a long spell on the sidelines, Wenger may be concerned about his ability to last the match if he starts at the Hawthorns.

Two wins on the bounce have altered the perception of Sean Dyche\xe2\x80\x99s side from game but doomed sightseers to awkward underdogs who suddenly do not look as out of their depth as we thought they were a month ago. Beating Hull at home has given them a new lease of life and last week they stunned Stoke at the Britannia Stadium thanks to two early goals from Danny Ings, who has scored three times in his past four matches. If Ings keeps scoring, then Burnley have a chance and the signs are that he is starting to find his feet in the Premier League. Aston Villa, winless in their past eight matches and without the suspended Christian Benteke, will be wary visitors to Turf Moor.
