b'Arsenal v Chelsea: match preview'


b'<p>Arsenal have their opportunity to nibble at Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s lead, with Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger seeking a first victory over a Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho side at the 13th try, and to postpone the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 coronation for another week at least. The focus will be drawn towards Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas on his first return to the Emirates as a Chelsea player with Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s sales pitch having lured him from Barcelona last summer. \xe2\x80\x9cI promised him he\xe2\x80\x99d be an important player in our project,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Portuguese. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that, normally, good projects end with titles.\xe2\x80\x9d The home support will be pained that their former favourite is close to achieving that aim.
