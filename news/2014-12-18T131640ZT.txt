b'The Fiver Christmas Awards 2014'


b'<p>Welcome to the 15th Fiver Christmas Awards. Or is it the 16th? Oh, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know. We\xe2\x80\x99ve disingenuously pretended to forget how many times we\xe2\x80\x99ve held these awards at least a dozen times, so there\xe2\x80\x99s a starting point for anyone who cares enough to tot it up. Furthermore, it\xe2\x80\x99s now more than a decade since we awarded Bayer Leverkusen an unprecedented Fiver Christmas Awards quadruple, and in honour of their legendary coach Klaus Toppm\xc3\xb6ller (kids, ask your grandparents) we declare that now is a time for cigarettes and booze. And curly hair, with locks springy enough to hold a lit cigarette, just in case you have a can of Purple Tin and a quadruple gin on the go at the same time. But as well as it being time for cigarettes and booze, and hairstyles specifically designed to assist in the consumption of cigarettes and booze, it\xe2\x80\x99s also time to dole out a few awards. Mainly because we sense you\xe2\x80\x99re losing interest already, and if we don\xe2\x80\x99t start soon, the Fiver will be in your bin folder quicker than we can say \xe2\x80\x9cGah!\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cWah!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cOh reader! How could you!?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> THE BANKSY AWARD FOR WRITING ON THE WALL <p>The Guardian\xe2\x80\x99s monkeys-and-typewriters MBM operation concluded their 2010 World Cup final report thus: \xe2\x80\x9cCongratulations to Spain!!! Next stop Brazil 2014! Which is a meltdown for the hosts waiting to happen. See you all then for that one!\xe2\x80\x9d Well done to us, then, though to be honest it didn\xe2\x80\x99t take the love child of Nostradamus and Russell Grant to work out that Brazil were destined to be crushed under the ludicrous weight of expectation at their own World Cup. Look what happened to them in 1950, for example, and they had a good side back then. Sure enough, Germany duly scored seven times past music-hall tumbling act David Luiz and 10 living statues the CBF had shipped in from Covent Garden. The match, which would have ended 10-0 were it not for the efforts of brave Brazilian hero Mesut \xc3\x96zil, ensured this World Cup would be remembered as one of the more eventful ones, because after a dismal set of knockout ties it had been heading right down the swanny beforehand. In this sense, Brazil saved their own World Cup, so well done to them for that. Treble caipirinhas all round!</p>      THE ADRYAN AWARD FOR PREPOSTEROUS OVER-REACTION <p>Yes, this business about the 2014 World Cup flirting with the swanny. Anyone who gave the 2002, 2006 and 2010 World Cups, plus Euro 2004, 2008 and 2012, more than a cursory glance will be aware that \xe2\x80\x93 while they were good fun in the moment, as major championships invariably are \xe2\x80\x93 they weren\xe2\x80\x99t actually much cop. Point this out at the time, however, and one risked being chased into the sea by a pompous mob wielding pointed sticks and cast-iron statuettes of Valeriy Lobanovskyi, a shower desperate to convince themselves they were living through a golden age of football, as opposed to being members of a generation who unfortunately missed it by five decades. Ah well, bad luck, that was the Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s fate too. Oddly enough, these very same people then started using that middling-at-best stretch of tournaments to illustrate, by way of juxtaposition, the BEST EVER nature of the 2014 World Cup, which was the BEST EVER. They\xe2\x80\x99re probably BEST NEVER listened to, these folk. The over-heated brouhaha began pretty much from the get-go, what with Brazil being bobbins, Robin van Persie doing a good goal, and Japan and Greece playing out a fascinating scoreless draw which revealed layer upon layer of complexity as time went on, like a fine wine, or a free jazz album, or a break-up letter. But group stages are no time to be judging tournaments, and the knockout matches reverted to modern type: diverting enough when they were on, but good luck trying to convince someone they were classics in 10 years\xe2\x80\x99 time.</p> THE HUTTON INQUIRY WHITEWASH AWARD <p>Fair play to Fifa for leaving no stone unturned as it conducted a rigorous investigation into, er, itself and reached the conclusion that there was absolutely nothing untoward about the way that Russia and Qatar were handed the next two World Cups, whilst making sure to toe-punt the Football Association where it hurts for good measure. You might think you smell a rat, but that\xe2\x80\x99s actually just the 24-course lunch it awarded itself as a reward for its fine work. You also might think you can hear Michael Garcia complaining about the way his report has been mishandled, plus a couple of people blowing some whistles, and a few concerned folk asking what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be done about those hundreds of dead migrant workers who are putting the infrastructure together in Qatar, but that\xe2\x80\x99s just Sepp Blatter chuckling as he watches Tim Roth\xe2\x80\x99s outstanding portrayal of him in the critically acclaimed Fifa film for the 56th time. So hats off to Fifa, a great bunch of lads, the very best humanity has to offer, a shining example for us all to follow.</p> THE TONY BLAIR / GORDON BROWN AWARD FOR MAKING A ROYAL BALLS OF EVERYTHING THEN LETTING SOME OTHER POOR HAPLESS SOD TAKE ALL THE FLAK <p>Steve Gerrard, Gerrard, he slipped on his f%\xc2\xa3*$&amp;g a^\xe2\x80\x9de. Well, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got that damn straight. But perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s time to give the poor old boy a break. Partly because he\xe2\x80\x99s condemned to replay that moment in his head for, at a conservative estimate, ooh, the rest of eternity. Sing all you like, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to make little difference to a soul in torment. But mainly we should lay off because Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s pratfall wasn\xe2\x80\x99t actually the point the league title slipped through Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s fingers. That happened at 3.27pm on Sunday 13 April, when a dozy Victor Moses needlessly lost control of the ball in midfield against Manchester City, panicking Jordan \xe2\x80\x98Legs of Steven\xe2\x80\x99 Henderson into a rash challenge which saw him sent off and suspended for the majority of the run-in. Bye bye, chances! Bye bye! But if passing the blame on to Moses for Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s end-of-season debacle seems overly harsh \xe2\x80\x93 he was only an on-loan observer for most of the campaign after all \xe2\x80\x93 then let\xe2\x80\x99s hoick the opprobrium towards King Brenny instead, for tactics that serial title-winner Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have considered in a month of Super Sundays. Put it this way: if Nemanja Matic slips over on the halfway line during a crucial game of this season\xe2\x80\x99s run-in, do you think the Demba Ba of this situation will have fewer than eight men to beat?</p>      THE ROBBIE SAVAGE AWARD FOR CONFUSION <p>Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s 2013-14 campaign provided, at some point along the season, something for absolutely everyone to enjoy, with the possible exception of Brighton and Hove Albion fans, who never like to see Crystal Palace supporters happy. But their collapse, which couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been more spectacular had the entire team been perched in human pyramid formation on the back seat of a Ford Model T with no suspension being driven down a rickety wooden pier with several planks missing from the floor, has tended to obscure the fact that Chelsea turned their season\xe2\x80\x99s end into a Hollywood silent comedy too. Their last six games saw them drop four points at home to Sunderland and Norwich which would have given them the title, and lose a winning lead in the Big Cup semis against Atl\xc3\xa9tico. No amount of jigging up and down the touchline, or post-hoc rationalisation convincing yourself you didn\xe2\x80\x99t care, alters that fact. Manchester City can therefore consider themselves very fortunate indeed that they were competing against such a gaggle of chancers. Mind you, Chelsea do at least appear to have learned their lesson if the first half of this season is anything to go by, unlike Liverpool, who probably do deserve the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of the mocking, now we come to think about it. Actually, we\xe2\x80\x99re not quite sure what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to say here. Last year\xe2\x80\x99s top three were all useless? Hmm. Can we retrospectively award the title to Arsenal? They could do with cheering up. The FA Cup doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have done much good.</p> THE APPLES, MOUTHWASH, FLOSS AND SUGAR-FREE GUM AWARD FOR DENTAL HEALTH <p>Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez is over now, just another skilful shill doing a turn for a club that always wins stuff. Messi, Him, Rodr\xc3\xadguez, Neymar, these goons are 10 a penny. But Su\xc3\xa1rez used to have a unique selling point. Playing for giants whose glory days were long past \xe2\x80\x93 Ajax, Liverpool, Uruguay \xe2\x80\x93 each goal was imbued with a little Maradona-at-Napoli renegade charm, some street-fighting sass, a cutting edge. Erm. Anyway, now he\xe2\x80\x99s turning on a sixpence, wriggling free of trouble and belting them home in a similar manner for Bar\xc3\xa7a. Great goals, but so what? He\xe2\x80\x99s still got Uruguay, of course, so hats off to what currently stands as his last hurrah, his performance at the 2014 World Cup. Man of the tournament? The Fiver should say so, because nobody\xe2\x80\x99s going to forget his two appearances in a hurry: an evisceration of England on one-and-a-half legs, plus that bite against Italy. Here\xe2\x80\x99s a question: do you know anyone who, upon hearing what had happened, didn\xe2\x80\x99t start laughing like a drain? No, us neither. And that applies to the bite as well.</p> THE DIEGO MARADONA 1984 COPA DEL REY MEMORIAL AWARD FOR ACCEPTING DEFEAT WITH DIGNITY <p>Poor old Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid. Were it not for approximately 90 seconds\xe2\x80\x99 worth of football, split in half and tacked on to the end of two separate Big Cup finals, they\xe2\x80\x99d have been European champions in 1974 and 2014. But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t to be. Forty years ago, Bayern Munich equalised late, then ran out 4-0 winners in a replay, Gerd M\xc3\xbcller scoring the sort of hat-trick that makes modern-day statistical usurper Lionel Messi look like the two-bit chancer the World Cup final proved him to be. Anyway, we digress. This time round, Atl\xc3\xa9tico were seconds away from beating city rivals Real, but Sergio Ramos, the Hans-Georg Schwarzenbeck de nos jours, denied them their first European Cup with a header in the very last act of added time. With strange echoes of \xe2\x80\x9874, Atl\xc3\xa9tico again ended up shipping four, on this occasion by the end of extra-time. At which point Rapha\xc3\xabl Varane kicked the ball in the vague direction of Atl\xc3\xa9tico boss Diego Simeone, and nearly had his head whipped clean off his shoulders for his trouble, first as Simeone launched the ball back at him, then storming on the pitch with a view to instigating a Hegelian dialectic. Marvellous entertainment, go on my son, get right into him, etc. And no, the Fiver can\xe2\x80\x99t be bothered to think of the kids. To hell with the kids.</p>      THE RICHARD KEYS \xe2\x80\x98IT WAS JUST BANTER\xe2\x80\x99 AWARD <p>The LMA really did excel itself when it put out that statement in defence of Malky Mackay in the wake of the G@y Snake Scandal, saying messages allegedly exchanged with Iain Moody were merely a case of an eejit \xe2\x80\x9cletting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter\xe2\x80\x9d. Oh LMA! Oh Malky! Oh friendly text message banter! You didn\xe2\x80\x99t think that one through, did you? Friendly text message banter, for crying out loud. What a collection of clowns, a purportedly serious organisation carrying on as though it\xe2\x80\x99s run by the Lad Bible. It\xe2\x80\x99s come to something when Vinny T comes up smelling of roses. </p> THE NIGEL FARAGE POLITICAL CORRECTNESS AWARD FOR IMPROVING RACE RELATIONS BEYOND ALL EXPECTATIONS <p>Fortunately for Mackay, he did not have to wait long until he was back in the game and how nice that, in Dave Whelan, he had a boss at Wigan Athletic who was willing to take the heat off his back by enraging the Jewish and Chinese communities with some choice comments of his own. A selfless act, you\xe2\x80\x99ll no doubt agree, and surely Whelan deserves our respect for falling on his sword so shambolically, an act of bravery that surely surpasses the time that he broke his leg playing at Wembley. A time he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like to talk about. Oh no.</p> THE KEITH BURKINSHAW THERE-USED-TO-BE-A-FOOTBALL-CLUB-OVER-THERE AWARD <p>Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, West Ham, Newcastle, Aston Villa, Hull City, QPR, Cardiff City, Nasty Leeds, The Pope\xe2\x80\x99s O\xe2\x80\x99Rangers, The Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Celtic, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Milan and Bayern Munich. Previous winner: Tottenham Hotspur (1984).</p> THE TRINNY AND SUSANNAH AWARD FOR BEST-DRESSED MANAGER <p>Forget Jogi L\xc3\xb6w and his designer jumpers or Pep Guardiola\xe2\x80\x99s touchline denim, this was the year when Tactics Tim wowed the fashion world by giving a new lease of life to the humble gilet.</p>      <p>THE BOB SHANKLY / WILLIE WADDELL / LORD FERG / JIM McLEAN AWARD FOR CARTEL-BUSTING</p> <p>This one\xe2\x80\x99s shared between Ronny Deila and Peter Lawwell, whose sterling efforts on the bench and in the boardroom at Parkhead are threatening to make the Scottish title race a bit more interesting than it has been of late. Since 1985, if we\xe2\x80\x99re being exact. Whether Caley Thistle, Dundee United or the Accies can sustain their challenges or not in the new year is a moot point, but the fact we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to December and the title hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been decided yet puts Scottish football ahead of Germany\xe2\x80\x99s in at least one respect. And this represents progress, of sorts. Who said the Scottish top flight couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do without Pope\xe2\x80\x99s O\xe2\x80\x99Rangers? Well, take a look. Here, does anyone fancy double-checking the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Celtic\xe2\x80\x99s accounts? Find something eyebrow-raising in there, hope Ally McCoist somehow keeps hold of the Ibrox gig, and Scottish football really could be on to something for the next few years.</p> <p>THE PIERS MORGAN AWARD FOR BEST SELF-AGGRANDISING IN THE FACE OF ADVERSITY</p> <p>It takes a special sort of man to be Alan Pardew. Being Alan Pardew is not an easy act to pull off and it is often best to leave it to the expert. Which brings us neatly on to Alan Pardew. Sure, he\xe2\x80\x99s not the most popular man on Tyneside, second only in the hate stakes to Big Mike Ashley, last seen earning rave reviews for some impromptu street comedy outside a pub in the West End. But does he let that get him down? As if. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s modestly awarding credit to himself for Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s form or announcing during a tricky run of form that he was going to keep his spirits high by going home and polishing the manager of the year trophy he won two years ago, at least we now know that Pardew doesn\xe2\x80\x99t shirk his responsibilities when it comes to household chores.</p> THE MAROUANE FELLAINI, JUAN MATA AND ANDER HERRERA AWARD FOR GIVING PEOPLE A CHANCE <p>This upsurge Manchester United are currently enjoying \xe2\x80\xa6 maybe poor old Davie Moyes had an eye for a player after all, huh?</p> THE BLOKE FROM STOKE STANDING IN THE BACKGROUND WINCING AT THE NEWS WILSON PALACIOS COST \xc2\xa38m AWARD FOR MOST CONCERNED FOOTBALL FANS  <p>That bunch of \xe2\x80\xa6 entitled Arsenal supporters who felt compelled to gang up on their club\xe2\x80\x99s manager \xe2\x80\x93 a senior citizen \xe2\x80\x93 by effing, jeffing and shouting abuse at him as he attempted to board a London-bound train in Stoke. Honourable mention: the particularly overfamiliar Arsenal fan among this bunch who urged \xe2\x80\x9cJoely\xe2\x80\x9d Campbell to \xe2\x80\x9cget out while you still can\xe2\x80\x9d, as if the Costa Rican striker was some sort of exceptionally precocious individual whose footballing genius is unappreciated by his manager, rather than \xe2\x80\xa6 er, some bog-standard striker who scored eight goals in 32 appearances on loan at Olympiakos last season. </p> <p>THE DR NICK RIVIERA AWARD FOR BEST MEDICAL ADVICE</p> <p>Fulham fans were hopeful of avoiding relegation when they sacked Ren\xc3\xa9 Meulensteen, the true mastermind behind Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s success during the Lord Ferg era, and replaced him with Felix Magath, winner of three Bundesliga titles with Bayern Munich and Wolfsburg. Here was a manager who was going to whip the \xc2\xa312m Kostas Mitroglou into shape, all right, and Fulham did get a couple of wins that briefly made it look like they were going to stay up. But down they did go and Magath was soon on his way, with stories emerging that the German had told Brede Hangeland to treat leg-knack with a lump of cheese. Then again, Germany did win the World Cup. Maybe he was on to something. You wait, they\xe2\x80\x99ll soon be stocking up on emmenthal and brie at St George\xe2\x80\x99s Park.</p>      THE PETER KAY \xe2\x80\x98AVE-IT\xe2\x80\x99 AWARD FOR UNAPOLOGETIC 19th CENTURY TACTICS <p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho wasn\xe2\x80\x99t happy when West Ham turned up at Stamford Bridge in January with the sole aim of leaving with a point, the Hammers going to the trouble of boarding up their goal and placing a couple of grand pianos and Andy Carroll in front of it just to make sure. And it worked, a triumphant 0-0 victory for West Ham, Big Sam Allardyce brilliantly blunt when it was put to him that Mourinho had accused him of archaic tactics. \xe2\x80\x9cHa Ha Ha Ha!\xe2\x80\x9d he chortled. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t take it, can he? He can\xe2\x80\x99t take it because we\xe2\x80\x99ve out-tactic-ed him, out-witted him. He just can\xe2\x80\x99t cope. He can tell me all he wants. I don\xe2\x80\x99t give a sh1te.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> THE NATIONAL RAIL AWARD FOR BEST CUSTOMER SERVICES <p>This would also be heading the way of Big Sam if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s turnaround this season, which has forced many fans to do a sheepish about-turn about their manager, but luckily charm school\xe2\x80\x99s Nasty Nige Pearson has been busy endearing himself to the Leicester City faithful, allegedly telling one to \xe2\x80\x9c[eff] off and die\xe2\x80\x9d during the defeat to Liverpool. You can understand both points of view. The fan had every right to be annoyed, they were losing to Liverpool, after all, and who does that these days? </p> THE BLOKE FROM MERSEYSIDE STANDING IN THE BACKGROUND PRODDING A SKY SPORTS NEWS MAN IN THE EAR WITH A GIANT RUBBER LOVE TRUNCHEON AWARD FOR MOST PROBING QUESTIONS <p> Brazilian columnist and TV presenter Mario Sergio Conti, who hit pay-dirt when he found himself sitting next to then Brazil manager Luiz Felipe Scolari on a flight from Rio to S\xc3\xa3o Paulo during the World Cup, proceeded to interview him and had his scoop published in Brazil dailies Folha de S. Paulo and O Globo. Sadly for Conti, the passenger sitting beside him was not Big Phil, but a lookalike named Wladimir Palomo, who was travelling to participate in a TV comedy show in which he was playing the Brazil manager. Following apologies from both newspapers, Conti did likewise. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d he sobbed. \xe2\x80\x9cI really thought he was Felip\xc3\xa3o. But there was no bad faith involved. At least this mistake has not harmed anyone, it has not influenced the elections or hit the stock markets.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> THE BILL GATES AWARD FOR SERVICES TO TECHNOLOGY <p>What an extraordinary year it has been for everyone\xe2\x80\x99s favourite television personality and the poster boy for 21st century feminism, Richard Keys, who has been unstinting in his commitment to keeping the world entertained with his various bouts of score-settling, his burning sense of injustice and, of course, his recent discovery of something called the internet. On the one hand, you have to give it to him for his willingness to roll with the times and embrace the digital age, but on the other, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to do that at all, you just have to sit back and let his utter magnificence wash all over you. Where to begin? There was the baffling moment at the World Cup when Keys got himself into a right old mess as he tried to work out how goalline technology worked after France\xe2\x80\x99s thoroughly uncontroversial strike against Honduras. \xe2\x80\x9cThat wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in. At any time. Told you this technology wasn\xe2\x80\x99t foolroof,\xe2\x80\x9d Keys raged, before admitting that dark forces were not at work once he had found a photograph in which it was impossible to see the ball. \xe2\x80\x9cGot us another angle,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was in.\xe2\x80\x9d A crucial intervention, but not the highlight of what came to be known as The Keys Kup. No, that was when Keys bought himself a video camera and decided to film his adventures with Hank Schrader. There they were, bantering in the car, an early-morning road trip that could only have been more tortuous if they had picked up Rutger Hauer\xe2\x80\x99s character from The Hitcher along the way. It was award-winning stuff, even though Keys couldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite get to grips with how the camera worked, and yet the best was still to come. Because Keys also has a blog. And recently he wrote a blog urging $tevie Mbe to leave Liverpool, a Partridgean work of art which contained a sudden diversion about his departure from Sky for some minor indiscretion. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m currently having the time of my life at BeIn Sports,\xe2\x80\x9d Keys boasted. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t remember life being any better. But back to Steven.\xe2\x80\x9d At least he\xe2\x80\x99s made himself parody-proof.</p> THE ICE BUCKET CHALLENGE AWARD FOR SELF AGGRANDISING FOOTBALLERS MASQUERADING AS CHARITY DO-GOODERS <p> Admit it, you\xe2\x80\x99re struggling to remember the name of the cause they were trying to raise awareness of and so are they.</p> PLAYER OF THE YEAR <p>Demba Ba.</p> RUNNER-UP <p>Fred.</p> TEAM OF THE YEAR <p>Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid.</p> BUMPER ONE-OFF FESTIVE TV &amp; RADIO SPECIAL: ALL THE HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE CHRISTMAS AND NEW YEAR PERIOD <p>Right, aye.
