b'The Fiver | Your rheumy-eyed, jaundiced old pal'


b'<p>MR ROY\xe2\x80\x99S GOT HIS SHISHA PIPE</p> <p>The Fiver doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know if Jack Wilshere is addicted to smoking, but we do know just how difficult it is to quit those infernal coffin nails once they\xe2\x80\x99ve strangled you in their death grip. Lord knows, we\xe2\x80\x99ve tried our hardest to pack in the tabs over the years, but remain hopelessly hooked because we\xe2\x80\x99re weak-willed and still think smoking looks cool. Admit it, you probably do too. In fact you\xe2\x80\x99ve probably looked on enviously as your rheumy-eyed, jaundiced old pal The Fiver stands there in the cold, shivering in a pub doorway while sucking on the dog-end gripped between our yellow-stained fingers. Yes, looked on and thought: \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I was \xe2\x80\xa6 that\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Of course, unlike Jack, when The Fiver tries to quit smoking we can\xe2\x80\x99t count on the support of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s football journalists. A collective paragon of unbelievably healthy living, a select number of these people seem so concerned about young Jack\xe2\x80\x99s health that they have made it their business to stage a form of media intervention in a bid to shame him into quitting. You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the pictures. You\xe2\x80\x99ve read the sanctimonious articles. Your mind has boggled at the sensational headlines:</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYoung Man Smokes Cigarette Outside Nightclub!\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYoung Man Has Drag of Somebody Else\xe2\x80\x99s Cigarette On Holiday!\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYoung Man Pictured Holding Moroccan Restaurant Bong Thing!\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Fiver wants to believe that it is with Jack\xe2\x80\x99s blessing such stories appear, although we\xe2\x80\x99re obviously not that na\xc3\xafve. What The Fiver doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to believe is that the poor lad can\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy a smoke in his leisure time without lots of tell-tales who will never be as fit or athletic as he is feeling the need to scuttle off and alert his employers, although we\xe2\x80\x99re not that na\xc3\xafve either. The Fiver likes cigarettes because we find they help us to mind our own business. Perhaps some of those castigating Jack for smoking could be persuaded to try one too.</p> <p>One man who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem too perturbed by Jack\xe2\x80\x99s extra-curricular activities is Mr Roy. A very well read, widely travelled man with an interesting take on life and plenty of fascinating opinions on all sorts of different subjects, the England manager must have died a little inside upon meeting the press yesterday, only to be quizzed about his thoughts on a grown man who occasionally works for him being pictured holding a shisha pipe. If he was irritated, he hid it well, choosing instead to sensibly point out that holding \xe2\x80\x93 or even smoking \xe2\x80\x93 such an instrument is no big deal. When it was pointed out to him that some of them contain nicotine (much like cigarettes, tomatoes, potatoes, aubergines and green peppers), he maintained his position, pointing out that he had once tried a bang on a bong himself.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs an ex-cigar smoker when I tried it I thought it was a complete nonsense, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand who would do it,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced, prompting those bellows of over-the-top laughter you only ever really hear at football press conferences. \xe2\x80\x9cApart from a faint fruity taste in your mouth that was about the end of it. As far as I am concerned that is a club matter and Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger dealt with it very, very well. If you are asking me, in an ideal world is that an ideal thing to happen? Of course it isn\xe2\x80\x99t, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t live in an ideal world.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Too right we don\xe2\x80\x99t, although we do live in a world where Mr Roy once had a faintly fruity taste in his mouth. Having clearly learned nothing from his smoke-shaming, today video footage emerged of Jack the Lad turning up at the house of a poorly child, to surprise the boy on his return home from school. A more responsible adult would have insisted the boy did his homework before firing up the PlayStation, but not feckless footballer Jack. First smoking and now encouraging child stupidity \xe2\x80\x93 are there no avenues this so-called \xe2\x80\x9crole model\xe2\x80\x9d will not explore in his ongoing bid to lead the youth of this country astray?</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cJames attended training on Thursday with us.

How would he describe himself? \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll go with that.

One weekday evening shift, then-Reading captain and Northern Ireland international, Barry Hunter, paid a visit \xe2\x80\x93 probably to buy a cheap golf umbrella or something similar \xe2\x80\x93 much to the delight of some local shoppers. One excited woman immediately bought a \xc2\xa33 football from the big bins located at the front of the store and got it signed by Mr Hunter. She then showed the ball to a member of staff \xe2\x80\x93 who happened to be the store manager \xe2\x80\x93 and asked, excitedly: \xe2\x80\x98How much will you buy this ball back off me now?\xe2\x80\x99 Our manager took one look at the ball and simply said: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll give you \xc2\xa33 store credit for shop-soiled goods.\xe2\x80\x99 She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t overly impressed. On reading back, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the presence of Barry Hunter that makes this story interesting but probably does add to the mundanity of it. I never did check eBay for said item\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Alan Dooney.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI bumped into Louis van Gaal outside Wembley before we thrashed Holland 4-1 during Euro 96. Due to my slight overindulgence in lager at the Middlesex Arms beforehand, I decided he was Holland\xe2\x80\x99s then-current manager. \xe2\x80\x98I hope you lose mate,\xe2\x80\x99 was my erudite comment. \xe2\x80\x98I hope for you also,\xe2\x80\x99 was his mysterious reply. Pick the bones out of that one\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Neil Doherty.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn 2003 I was working behind the counter in an Edinburgh shoe shop when who should approach my till but Heart of Midlothian (and latterly Leicester City and Dundee United) forward Mark De Vries. I remember, distinctly, that he was buying a pair of all-white Nike Air Force 1s and a pair of tan nu buck Timberland boots, size 11. Throughout our transaction the lanky Dutchman conducted himself like a perfect gent, even when I embarrassingly had to tell him his credit card had been declined. \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s OK (clocking my name tag), Joe. It\xe2\x80\x99s a new card and I was half expecting that. I\xe2\x80\x99ll pop back in later.\xe2\x80\x99 He never returned and I thought that meant the end of our burgeoning friendship. Then, a couple of weeks later, I\xe2\x80\x99m wandering along George Street, and who should I see but my old mate Mark. Not wanting to embarrass him, I decided it would be in bad taste to stop for a chat. Just as I was about to pass him, I heard him say \xe2\x80\x98Joe!\xe2\x80\x99 I gave him a smile and a nod, which he returned with a wink and smile of his own. Not heard from him since but there\xe2\x80\x99s not a day that goes past that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think of him, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he would say the same of me\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Joe West.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI used to work for a large insurance company in Liverpool city centre and, every Christmas, a supplier would take us out for a very boozy Christmas lunch which continued on into the evening. By about 9pm, only three of us remained out drinking and as we staggered out of a pub, a large silver Lexus swept around the corner towards us and stopped to drop somebody off. \xe2\x80\x98Oh look,\xe2\x80\x99 said my mate, \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s John Barnes\xe2\x80\x99. In my drunken stupor my mind went into overtime \xe2\x80\xa6 John Barnes, he lives near me, he could give me a lift home. My two mates looked on in horror as I approached the driver\xe2\x80\x99s side window and gave it a confident rap, the window slid down gracefully to reveal the visage of one John Barnes. \xe2\x80\x98Alright Barnesy lad,\xe2\x80\x99 I blurted in my best scouse accent. \xe2\x80\x98You live near me, mate, you could give me a lift home.\xe2\x80\x99 After ascertaining exactly where I lived, John did indeed invite me to jump into the passenger seat, which I did and as I looked back out of the rear windscreen, the stunned faces of my two mates with their mouths agape will live in the memory for a long time. Barnesy then gave me a lift from Liverpool all the way through the Mersey Tunnel to Heswall on the Wirral, listening to my drunken rant about Fowler and McManaman being traitors to the Everton cause, and even shook my hand and asked me my name as he dropped me off. A true gentleman and a scholar\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Harry Markham.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: Mr Roy\xe2\x80\x99s disappointment at the taste of his shisha pipe. Like Mr Roy, I also can\xe2\x80\x99t see the point in smoking shisha, but my feelings also extend to watching England play as this only leaves a strong taste of disappointment and regret in my mouth\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Will Bayly.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cKindly inform Andy Myall (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters) that in ornithological circles there is no such bird as a seagull.

Last night I dreamt that I\xe2\x80\x99d been asked to select the Norn Iron national side. Banjaxed by the poverty of options open to me, my cunning plan was to select players from other countries whose names ended in \xe2\x80\x98o\xe2\x80\x99, move the \xe2\x80\x98o\xe2\x80\x99 to the start and claim they were Irish (any readers who want to take up with my dreaming self, either on the quality of Norn Iron players or the knobbly-stick stereotype, please do so in dream form). I\xe2\x80\x99d got as far as O\xe2\x80\x99Ronaldinh, O\xe2\x80\x99Zic and O\xe2\x80\x99Del Pier when I woke up. Anyone want to help finish the XI? I suppose I\xe2\x80\x99ll chuck in Pierre-Patrick O\xe2\x80\x99Bameyang too\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Jon Gerrard.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
