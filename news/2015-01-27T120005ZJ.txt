b'<p>John Carver organised a football match between Newcastle United\xe2\x80\x99s backroom staff and north-east-based journalists last Friday.</p> <p>The game \xe2\x80\x93 won 6-0 by the interim manager\xe2\x80\x99s support team \xe2\x80\x93 may appear to be an inconsequential event but, in the context of life at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park, it was a significant and subversive act that emphasises why he should not be underestimated.</p> <p>Considering that Mike Ashley, Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s owner, spent much of 2014 restricting the written press\xe2\x80\x99s access to the club, Alan Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s interim successor knew that his invitation for a kickabout was politically loaded but pressed ahead with the plan regardless. Whereas Pardew had swiftly bowed to pressure from above to abandon the idea of an \xe2\x80\x9coff-the-record\xe2\x80\x9d lunch with reporters last summer, Carver made it clear he was his own man.</p> <p>After a narrow home defeat by Southampton the previous Saturday the 50-year-old blithely overruled the boardroom edict that Newcastle managers must no longer offer reporters representing daily newspapers separate briefings. Instead everyone was summoned to a quiet corridor where Carver made his opinion plain that his bosses could not allow the potentially damaging hiatus over Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s replacement to endure much longer. He also let it be known that he was disappointed at the lack of communication he had received from Lee Charnley, the managing director, and said sufficient time had passed for a decision to have been made.</p> <p>If Charnley may have begun to appreciate a little of what Craig Bellamy felt when, more than a decade ago, Carver stood up to him over a spot of selfish car parking, the Tynesider\xe2\x80\x99s sometimes spiky ability to fight his corner was reputedly beginning to command Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s slightly amused admiration.</p>  <p> Related: John Carver to stay in charge of Newcastle until end of season </p>   <p>Rather than sacking the former Toronto manager and Newcastle, Leeds, Sheffield United and Plymouth No2 on the spot, Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s board had been persuaded that he is precisely the right sort of character to remain at the helm until the end of the season.</p> <p>Although Carver\xe2\x80\x99s appointment on Monday as head coach is strictly short-term, he has been told he will be considered for a longer-term contract alongside other shortlisted potential Pardew replacements, including Steve McClaren, Frank de Boer, Christophe Galtier, Thomas Tuchel and R\xc3\xa9mi Garde.</p> <p>Triumphing in this beauty contest will entail winning assorted battles on various fronts. The most urgent involves results. After presiding over three defeats and a draw Carver needs a win, preferably at Hull City on Saturday.</p> <p>With the team 11th on 27 points with 16 games to play, the boardroom consensus is that a side that have beaten Chelsea and Manchester City this season are too good to go down. Lose at the KC Stadium, though, and talk of Newcastle being \xe2\x80\x9cin crisis\xe2\x80\x9d will suddenly become deafening as, inexorably, Carver\xe2\x80\x99s brand new tracksuit turns toxic.</p> <p>His challenge at Hull \xe2\x80\x93 and in the series of tricky fixtures beyond \xe2\x80\x93 is to prove precisely why Ruud Gullit, Sir Bobby Robson and Freddy Shepherd rated his talents so highly. After Gullit catapulted him from an obscure role working with the club\xe2\x80\x99s youth players to coaching Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s first team back in 1998, Robson made him his No2 and Shepherd, the club\xe2\x80\x99s former chairman, recently said he made \xe2\x80\x9ca big mistake\xe2\x80\x9d in appointing Graeme Souness rather than Carver as manager after Robson\xe2\x80\x99s sacking in 2004.</p> <p>Immensely popular among the club\xe2\x80\x99s class of 2014-15, he still possesses the volatile streak that led to him, infamously, wrestling with Bellamy on the floor of a Newcastle airport departure lounge. Happily it is countered by an engaging generosity of spirt and unwillingness to hold grudges so pronounced that, during his time in Toronto, the former Wales forward spent a holiday in Canada staying at Carver\xe2\x80\x99s home.</p> <p>Yet if he commands locker-room loyalty, JC remains the subject of suspicion among fans, many of whom regard him as synonymous with Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s widely detested regime. Winning hearts and minds probably requires somehow transforming the once impressive Fabricio Coloccini and Cheik Tiot\xc3\xa9 from fading forces to key players while praying Ashley does not sell Moussa Sissoko and Papiss Ciss\xc3\xa9 before the end of the month.</p> <p>Although the squad craves both an extra striker and a defensive replacement for Steven Taylor \xe2\x80\x93 out until August with a ruptured achilles tendon \xe2\x80\x93 Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s interim successor is not expecting reinforcements but simply prays that a number of gifted individuals returning from long-term injuries, including Rolando Aarons, Mehdi Abeid and Davide Santon, enable him to deliver Charnley\xe2\x80\x99s stipulated top-10 finish.</p> <p>Along the way Carver intends to show a sceptical public that tactically he is really much closer to Robson and Kevin Keegan than his most recent boss. Only time will tell but Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s biggest fear must be that results confirm those unfashionable yet strangely compelling theories that Pardew was appallingly underrated on Tyneside.</p>'
