b'Crystal Palace 2-1 Tottenham Hotspur: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93as it happened'


b'<p>Well, what a lovely game that turned into. It was a game that seemed to hinge on the substitutions, with Spurs seemingly in some control after going 1-0 ahead. But then Mauricio Pochettino made some curious changes that messed with the structure of the team, whereas Pardew unleashed Wilf Zaha who seemed to put the fear of God into the Spurs defence. Palace are now 15th, though they are only one point ahead of QPR in second-bottom.</p> <p>Cheers for reading, and well done if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel a bit poorly watching Pards blow kisses to the crowd.</p>'
