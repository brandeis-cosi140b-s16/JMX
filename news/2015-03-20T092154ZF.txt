b'Football transfer rumours: Raheem Sterling to Manchester City for \xc2\xa350m?'


b'<p>Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s crack scouting team has scoured the globe in their search for undiscovered talent whose purchase would not have catastrophic consequences for their attempts to avoid the wrath of Uefa\xe2\x80\x99s financial fair play investigators, and then decided to just sod it, and buy at any price the bloke who plays really well for the big team down the road. Raheem Sterling is thus their target, with the Sun suggesting that \xc2\xa350m has been put aside for his purchase \xe2\x80\x93 before handily concluding their story with a quote that suggests that a) City probably can\xe2\x80\x99t buy him anyway, and b) If they did they\xe2\x80\x99d have to spend more than \xc2\xa350m. But hey, who reads the last paragraph? \xe2\x80\x9cYou are talking about trying to sign players from clubs that won\xe2\x80\x99t sell them,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel Pellegrini apparently said. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you get Sterling? Maybe if you go to Liverpool with \xc2\xa3100m.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>But even that kind of spending won\xe2\x80\x99t be beyond the moneybags Mancunians if, as the Mirror suggest, they make \xc2\xa3150m by flogging Vincent Kompany, Aleksandar Kolarov, Samir Nasri, Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9, Steven Jovetic and Edin Dzeko. And according to the Mirror, Liverpool have already decided who they\xe2\x80\x99d like to replace Sterling, should City turn up with that \xc2\xa3100m \xe2\x80\x93 and it\xe2\x80\x99s childhood Liverpool fan Theo Walcott, who they may be able to snaffle from the Emirates this summer if Arsenal choose to cash in on a player whose contract expires in 2016 and isn\xe2\x80\x99t in the team anyway.</p> <p>Manchester United are ready to raid Southampton for a promising English full-back for the second successive summer, and having snapped up Luke Shaw last close season Nathaniel Clyne is now on their radar. Apparently the Champions League aspirants (that\xe2\x80\x99s United) have given up on Rafael and, according to the Star, \xe2\x80\x9cmay test the water with a \xc2\xa320m offer\xe2\x80\x9d (there\xe2\x80\x99s no need to spend \xc2\xa320m to test the water in Southampton when the briefest glance will tell you it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty filthy and totally freezing, though that might not have been exactly what they meant). United, meanwhile, are rumoured to have a \xc2\xa3150m transfer war chest and have allocated a hefty chunk of it to buy Valencia\xe2\x80\x99s Nicolas Otamendi.</p> <p>Shakhtar Donetsk are ready to sell Douglas Costa, and have slapped a \xc2\xa325m asking price on the midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s bonce. That\xe2\x80\x99s not enough to put off Chelsea, whose existing Costa is so good they\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to get some more (this may not be their actual scouting policy). Also heading this way from places that could broadly be classified as \xe2\x80\x9cforeign\xe2\x80\x9d is Aleksandar Mitrovic, Anderlecht\xe2\x80\x99s 20-year-old Serbian hotshot, who has been identified by Swansea as Wilfried Bony\xe2\x80\x99s long-term replacement. Apparently they tried to sign him in January and will try again in the summer.</p> <p>Not heading this way, though, is Sami Khedira. The German midfielder won\xe2\x80\x99t leave Real Madrid for the Premier League because, Schalke chairman Clemens Tonnies reveals to Bild, \xe2\x80\x9che wants to come back to the Bundesliga\xe2\x80\x9d, a decision that may well upset English suitors including Arsenal but one that \xe2\x80\x9che does not doubt for a second\xe2\x80\x9d. But possibly Emirates-bound from Germany is Hakan Calhanoglu, Bayer Leverkusen\xe2\x80\x99s Turkish international midfielder. The playmaker is valued at \xc2\xa320m, but the Gunners hope to negotiate a hefty discount by sending Lukas Podolski the other way in part exchange.</p> <p>Across north London it looks like Tottenham will only sign players aged 26 or younger this summer, with the inevitable sprinkling of Southampton players on their wanted list alongside Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s Danny Ings and the Cologne centre-back Kevin Wimmer. The decision to solve the club\xe2\x80\x99s defensive issues the Wimmer way will particularly please fans of 1980s novelty hit giants Tight Fit.</p> <p>Newcastle are planning a summer splurge, with John Carver revealing that it has \xe2\x80\x9ccome to me from the top\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cthe club will invest in the summer\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cit needs it\xe2\x80\x9d. Meanwhile in the day\xe2\x80\x99s big managerial news, Gary and Phil Neville\xe2\x80\x99s sister Tracey has been named interim head coach of England\xe2\x80\x99s netball team.</p>'
