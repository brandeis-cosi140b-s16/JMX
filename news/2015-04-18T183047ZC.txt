b'Chelsea v Manchester United: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>For the seventh time in a row, Chelsea win by a single goal. For the fourth consecutive match, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t play particularly well but did enough to grind out the result - it may not be particularly pretty, but they won\xe2\x80\x99t care. </p> <p>A moment of class from Oscar and Eden Hazard was enough to win them all three points. They need six more to win the league and have six matches in which to get them. It\xe2\x80\x99s all over and their players know it. They\xe2\x80\x99re celebrating as if they\xe2\x80\x99ve won the league already. This was a big win for them and they handled Manchester United admirably. </p>     Branislav Ivanovic and Nemanja Matic celebrate after victory. Photograph: Jamie McDonald/Getty  '
