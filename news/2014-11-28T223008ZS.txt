b'Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s manager Gus Poyet prays for off-day from \xe2\x80\x98perfect\xe2\x80\x99 Chelsea'


b'<p>Gus Poyet is likely to be as surprised as anyone should his Sunderland side beat Chelsea for the third time in a row on Saturday evening but Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has reason to be wary of the Uruguayan. Quite apart from ending Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s record of 77 Premier League home games without defeat during his two stints in charge at Stamford Bridge courtesy of a 2-1 victory in west London in April, Sunderland also knocked Chelsea out of last season\xe2\x80\x99s Capital One Cup at the quarter-final stage.</p> <p>Considering that a couple of weeks earlier Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s struggling side narrowly lost their home league game against Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side 4-3 the stage seems set for an upset on Wearside. But Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s manager urges caution.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a different Chelsea \xe2\x80\x93 a better and stronger one than last season,\xe2\x80\x9d said the former Stamford Bridge midfielder. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are unbeaten in the Premier League and the best team in the country by far. They were strong title favourites before the season started and now they\xe2\x80\x99re even bigger favourites.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Poyet asked his old friend and one-time Chelsea team-mate Roberto Di Matteo for advice in the aftermath of Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side thrashing Di Matteo\xe2\x80\x99s Schalke in the Champions League this week but little was forthcoming. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a perfect Chelsea performance,\xe2\x80\x9d Poyet said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s hope they\xe2\x80\x99re not perfect against us. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be difficult but it\xe2\x80\x99s a great chance and we\xe2\x80\x99re the ones with the opportunity to end their unbeaten League run this season. Let\xe2\x80\x99s try.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t believe I\xe2\x80\x99m going for three wins against Jos\xc3\xa9. We\xe2\x80\x99re usually on the wrong end of stats and haven\xe2\x80\x99t beaten someone for about 50 years but now we\xe2\x80\x99re on the right side so let\xe2\x80\x99s enjoy it a bit. It\xe2\x80\x99s a game I\xe2\x80\x99d love to play in.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Not that Di Matteo exactly identified too many flaws in Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side. \xe2\x80\x9cI told my friend \xe2\x80\x99come on show me the way\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Roberto didn\xe2\x80\x99t. He said Chelsea defend better than any team in Europe. They defend better than Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to say if they can go unbeaten all season because there\xe2\x80\x99s such a long way to go but if there\xe2\x80\x99s one team who can do it, then it\xe2\x80\x99s probably Chelsea. They are special and unique and really strong and if they keep everyone fit they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be close to staying unbeaten. They\xe2\x80\x99re going to win the title without losing, or maybe losing only once.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>At least Poyet remains one manager with first hand experience of Mourinho the loser. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s always one of the best,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe congratulated us after we won there last season. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always had a great relationship with Jos\xc3\xa9 \xe2\x80\x93 we\xe2\x80\x99ve never had a bad word. In the past he\xe2\x80\x99s welcomed me to their training ground.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>After witnessing only two League wins this season, Sunderland fans would embrace a rare victory which might help assuage fears of another relegation skirmish. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople are talking about a relegation battle between 13 teams,\xe2\x80\x9d acknowledged Poyet. \xe2\x80\x9cSo we need to take our opportunities.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>His critics wonder whether a manager who has not named the same team twice in succession this season is proving his own worst enemy. \xe2\x80\x9cSomeone\xe2\x80\x99s just told me I\xe2\x80\x99m the new Tinkerman,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that and I hate being called it. \xe2\x80\x9cI hated it at Chelsea when the manager always tinkered. It\xe2\x80\x99s called squad rotation but I hate that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>So why employ it at Sunderland? \xe2\x80\x9cFrom Saturday to Saturday if the team does well the team should stay the same,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poyet who has been disappointed by the failure of certain players including Jack Rodwell and Adam Johnson to hit top form this term. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you need to perform well to make sure that happens.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>With Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s visit followed by Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s home game against Manchester City and next Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Liverpool, his players could not pick a better week to start impressing.</p>'
