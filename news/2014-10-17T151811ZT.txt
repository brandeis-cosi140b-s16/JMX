b'DON\xe2\x80\x99T STOP <p>Unlike the player himself, this Raheem Sterling story just runs and runs. Sterling, of course, recently signed a legally binding contract to become the world\xe2\x80\x99s first seven-day-a-week, 24-hour non-stop footballer, if the self-righteous flak he\xe2\x80\x99s been copping all week is anything to go by. And last Sunday, he was caught bang to rights on camera in Estonia, having momentarily stopped playing football. There he was, sliding across the floor on his face, his legs no longer moving, having just drawn the free-kick that helped to win a European Championship qualifier for England, saving erstwhile Halmstads, Orebro and Neuchatel Xamax high-achiever Mr Roy the ordeal of fielding some very awkward questions. What an indolent wage thief! And ending up in the repose position, too, no doubt planning on snatching forty winks like some sort of communist, sleep paid for by you, the hard-working taxpayer. And don\xe2\x80\x99t get Roy started about the 63-minute bohemian sit-in on the bench, when the only discernible movement in Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s legs was a few muscle fibres repairing themselves! No wonder he was furious!</p> <p>But it was inevitable that Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers would eventually launch a defence of his player, and sure enough in some press conference or other this afternoon, he addressed the issue of Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s alleged request to \xe2\x80\x9csit out\xe2\x80\x9d the Estonia game. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s grossly unfair because it\xe2\x80\x99s something he didn\xe2\x80\x99t say,\xe2\x80\x9d began Rodgers, his pearly white teeth arranged in the \xe2\x80\x98smile\xe2\x80\x99 format, albeit with a little frost forming across them, suggesting he\xe2\x80\x99s not actually that happy with the current state of things. \xe2\x80\x9cSome of the things that were said weren\xe2\x80\x99t true. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had Sterling come up to me before and tell me he is tired in the legs, and he\xe2\x80\x99s gone on and played brilliantly. This week has shook him a wee bit, but he\xe2\x80\x99s been working well and has been brilliant in training. He\xe2\x80\x99s back here in a secure environment.\xe2\x80\x9d Ow!</p> <p>Having launched one not particularly subtle shot across Hodgson\xe2\x80\x99s bows, he then decided he might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb. \xe2\x80\x9cThe best players cannot play every single game at the very top. You can break young players and at the age of 27 their careers will be over.\xe2\x80\x9d However Rodgers did offer an olive branch to England, if not Hodgson. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not club versus country, we are club and country. We take pride in our players playing for their country.\xe2\x80\x9d He then made a point of congratulating England for winning both of their qualification matches, the rest of the home nations for doing well too, and specifically and signally Gareth Southgate for taking the England Under-21s to their Euro finals. Having made his fairly obvious point by omission, Rodgers then went off to prepare for Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s weekend match at QPR, where Daniel Sturridge is supposed to return from the knack he picked up while being over-trained by England, and poor old Raheem will find himself slaughtered if he does some of his non-stop footballing, and slaughtered if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. Well done, Roy! England\xe2\x80\x99s future in safe hands.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBoth teams\xe2\x80\x99 players were disgraceful, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t behave like professionals. It was a disgrace and it means lots of work down the drain.

I can only speculate as to how vociferously he celebrated it but I am reminded of his, er, rousing speech to a group of Irish fans in Poland at Euro 2012.

A handshake, for goodness\xe2\x80\x99 sake. \xe2\x80\x9cI appreciate the comments,\xe2\x80\x9d he snided. \xe2\x80\x9cI think [Roy Keane and Paul Lambert] are two great examples of polite and very well-educated people, and because I\xe2\x80\x99m a humble guy who tries to learn every day and with every experience, I appreciate the comments.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Berti Vogts has quit his role as head coach of Azerbaijan in the wake of a 6-0 shellacking by Croatia. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said that the team had lacked assertiveness in their last game,\xe2\x80\x9d parped a statement from Azeri FA blazers.</p> <p>Peterhead striker Andy Rodgers has been banned for two matches after describing the people of Fife as \xe2\x80\x9cmutants\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cabsolute creatures\xe2\x80\x9d in a series of tweets.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Santos striker Leandro Dami\xc3\xa3o could be suspended for as many as six games after being charged with \xe2\x80\x9cunsportsmanlike behaviour\xe2\x80\x9d for pulling his own shirt in a bid to win a penalty.</p> <p>And Derry City have got their collapse in early before next month\xe2\x80\x99s FAI Cup final after their bench broke during a team photo-shoot. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all had a good laugh about the situation before a new replacement bench was carried on to the pitch and the photograph was eventually taken,\xe2\x80\x9d cheered boss Peter Hutton.</p> RECOMMENDED VIEWING            <p>Get your Guardian Football Show while it\xe2\x80\x99s still hot.</p> STILL WANT MORE? <p>Usually when Jacob Steinberg, Barry Glendenning and Nick Ames hang out during the week it is to practice and perform in their Rural Alberta Advantage tribute group.
