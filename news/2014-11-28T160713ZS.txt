b'Southampton v Manchester City: match preview'


b'<p>Second hosts third in the game of catch-up with this a true test of these sides\xe2\x80\x99 credentials. The visitors will hope to maintain momentum after their narrow victory against Swansea and late midweek triumph over Bayern Munich. Southampton secured a point at Aston Villa last time out but it is a mark of their progress to date this term that even a draw in the west Midlands felt wasteful. Their pedigree will be scrutinised in a tough schedule over the next month. There has been little evidence to date that they will be daunted.
