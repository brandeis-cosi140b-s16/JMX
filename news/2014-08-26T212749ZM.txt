b'MK Dons v Manchester United: Capital One Cup \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>Well, well, well. That was a comically inept performance from a young Manchester United defence and midfield featuring several players you suspect might never play for the club again. Or, indeed, make it back to Manchester in one piece. The famously volcanic Mount Van Gaal hasn\xe2\x80\x99t erupted publicly since his arrival in England, but I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing it could be any minute now before some reporter sends him over the edge. </p> <p>Thanks for your time and your emails, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a match report and comment piece up in a bit, under which you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to moan, bicker, squabble or riff on United pain. </p>'
