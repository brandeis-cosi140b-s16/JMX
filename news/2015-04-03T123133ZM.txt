b'Marouane Fellaini impossible to drop says Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s Louis van Gaal'


b'<p>Louis van Gaal has admitted that Marouane Fellaini is currently impossible to drop because of the Belgian\xe2\x80\x99s form for Manchester United.</p> <p>Fellaini has emerged as a key player for the manager after he struggled last season under Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s permanent predecessor, David Moyes, when joining from Everton. The 27-year-old has been used recently in an advanced role by Van Gaal and scored a fine goal in the 3-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur. Fellaini was also a standout performer in the 2-1 victory at Liverpool in United\xe2\x80\x99s last match \xe2\x80\x93 and recent performances have impressed the Dutchman.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen he plays as he does now I cannot change him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Van Gaal, who was asked what had been done to revive Fellaini\xe2\x80\x99s fortunes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first time I met him he was late [returning for pre-season] because of the World Cup. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know him. I knew him as a coach, that he played for Man United and Everton and national team, but the first time I saw him was in Manchester.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard a lot of stories about him but from the first training session he did what I asked. He was open and he wants to perform so I am not surprised. He had an unlucky season because he was injured and ill [this year], but when fit he has always played for me because I was looking for a balance and he can give a lot of balance.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>United are eight points behind Chelsea, who have played a match less, yet Van Gaal believes the championship could still be won.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cStill we can win the title \xe2\x80\x93 mathematically we can do that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, before denying surprise at United\xe2\x80\x99s position of fourth after taking over a team that finished seventh last term.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is surprised? We are working day in and day out, and we have to see how the players respond. How I train is not easy for players, it is a process. Maybe we are in the last step of the process. I hope so. What I have seen last five matches I think so, but we need to continue because if you lose two games in a row you might be fourth but not sure.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>For Aston Villa\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Old Trafford on Saturday, Robin van Persie is still unavailable because of an ankle injury. \xe2\x80\x9cRobin van Persie is still not in the group. Luke Shaw is [following a hamstring problem]. [Chris] Smalling is ill. Not sure if available. He is not feeling well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
