b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini denied that his team\xe2\x80\x99s late return from warm-weather training in Abu Dhabi was a factor in their shock 2-0 FA Cup defeat at the hands of the Championship side Middlesbrough.</p> <p>City only flew back into Manchester at 8pm on the evening before the game, leading to accusations of disrespecting the competition. Most teams would want at least a full day at home before an important game but Pellegrini insisted he was happy with the preparation. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople can think that if they like, but I have a different opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d the City manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think there was anything wrong at the start of the game, because we had six or seven clear chances to score in the first half and we were in control. Before they scored we were playing very well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Some of the City fans booing at the end may have a different opinion about that assessment. While Middlesbrough\xe2\x80\x99s goalkeeper, Tom\xc3\xa1s Mej\xc3\xadas, distinguished himself with a string of fine saves either side of half-time, City never carved their opponents open to create chances as clear as they would have wished and once the first goal had been scored it was only the visitors who looked like adding any more.</p> <p>City visit Chelsea next Saturday for what is shaping up to be a decisive encounter in the title race and Pellegrini does admit he is concerned about his side\xe2\x80\x99s form at present, with no wins in their past three games.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not normal to go two games at home without scoring,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini said. \xe2\x80\x9cPlus in each of those games we have conceded two as well, so we have some work to do in defence. We have had to change our style of play because we were without our main strikers for the best part of a month. Now they are back but they are still short of games, so we need time. I am concerned about the way we are playing, not because it is Chelsea next but because of the lack of goals and the goals we are conceding But we will work hard in advance of the Chelsea game. There will not be a problem of motivation and I believe we can go there and win.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Aitor Karanka was naturally pleased with Middlesbrough\xe2\x80\x99s win, describing it as easily his biggest achievement in his short managerial career. \xe2\x80\x9cWe just knocked out a Champions League team, Manchester City have one of the best squads in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d the Boro manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe could have scored more too \xe2\x80\x93 just like in the Championship we created a lot of good chances but didn\xe2\x80\x99t take them all.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Needless to say Boro did not take any time out for warm-weather training. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the normal Championship week for us,\xe2\x80\x9d Karanka said. \xe2\x80\x9cThree games in a week, and we managed to win them all. This might be the most satisfying, but in training on Monday our thoughts turn to Brentford. Our first objective this season is to win promotion, because getting out of the Championship is very tough.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
