b'<p>Welcome back, then, Ashley Cole. For all the urgency of the occasion at the Etihad Stadium as Manchester City and Roma shared a taut 1-1 draw, this was also a fond reunion \xe2\x80\x93 and possibly even a kind of farewell. Who knows, after more than 550 matches on English soil for Arsenal, England, Chelsea and now Roma, this could even turn out to have been Cole\xe2\x80\x99s last appearance here. If it is \xe2\x80\x93 and Cole has no intention of returning just yet \xe2\x80\x93 then Roma\xe2\x80\x99s left-back produced a suitably focused and aggressive performance, a fitting snapshot in 90 minutes of the best English defender of his generation and a genuine Champions League star of the last decade.</p> <p>At kick-off it seemed an agreeable oddity that the most experienced player on the pitch for this first meeting of Group E\xe2\x80\x99s second-tier hopefuls was an Englishman. This was Cole\xe2\x80\x99s 106th Champions League appearance, almost twice as many as Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 and Francesco Totti.</p> <p>In the event, though, it was City\xe2\x80\x99s slight but significant air of callowness in this competition that allowed Roma\xe2\x80\x99s venerable A-listers to creep back into the match and equalise from a goal down before creating a succession of chances on the break in the first half.</p> <p>Cole himself was composed and even quite coltish on Roma\xe2\x80\x99s left flank. So much so that as he led his team-mates off the pitch at half-time it was tempting to conclude, as it had been at the World Cup, that England\xe2\x80\x99s best left-back is currently retired from international football and plays in Italy.</p> <p>Indeed, three of the best players on the pitch in that opening 45 minutes \xe2\x80\x93 Cole, Totti and the haphazardly marauding Maicon \xe2\x80\x93 had a combined age of 104. Sometimes, at this level, it is a not-so-young man\xe2\x80\x99s game.</p> <p>What a player he has been: one of the best English tournament players of the modern era and perhaps the only member of that fashionably derided golden crop who always seemed to rise to rather than shrink from the occasion.</p> <p>There is, of course, a paradox that a player once hoist as a kind of acme of Premier League brattishness should end up representing enduring professionalism. Cole is 33 now, and a high-mileage model, but there is a fair argument City should not have stopped at Lampard but should have brought Cole in, too, last summer.</p> <p>He offers the same champion qualities and has about him still a calmness and presence that is lacking in City\xe2\x80\x99s current left-backs.</p> <p>Ga\xc3\xabl Clichy was Cole\xe2\x80\x99s replacement at Arsenal and here he started for City on the left, the same side down which Roma\xe2\x80\x99s early penetration came, with Maicon again running in on goal after taking the excellent Miralem Pjanic\xe2\x80\x99s pass into a pocket of space behind the full-back. For Cole, this was always going to be an intriguing sort of homecoming.</p> <p>Few English footballers have been so roundly booed and jeered over their careers \xe2\x80\x93 a peculiar thing in itself, given Cole\xe2\x80\x99s professionalism and air of quiet command, and a state of affairs driven almost entirely by off-field matters, most notably the laughable Partridge-meets-the-Premier-League episode during his salary negotiations at Arsenal. There were no boos here, though, on a mild, still night at the Etihad that had seemed likely to be a jittery one for Cole, confronted by Jes\xc3\xbas Navas, the quickest player in this City squad.</p> <p>Cole, though, has always relished going toe to toe by the touchline, as he did in the opening moments, lunging to steer the ball away from his man as, briefly, the match became all about Roma\xe2\x80\x99s grand old rampaging full-backs.</p> <p>First Maicon, veteran of a miserable 10-game season in the dog days of the Roberto Mancini era, gave away a penalty after four minutes. Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero yawned the kick into the corner but moments later it was almost Maicon redux as the Brazilian stormed forward on to a superb lofted pass by Totti and smashed a shot on to the bar, the rebound narrowly evading Cole \xe2\x80\x93 yes, Cole \xe2\x80\x93 inside \xe2\x80\x93 yes, inside \xe2\x80\x93 the six-yard box.</p> <p>And so it went on in that opening period as Cole in particular made more marauding forward darts when Roma had possession than he seemed to do in his entire final season at Chelsea. On 32 minutes he might even have scored, careering in at the back post as Roma\xe2\x80\x99s most advanced player and just failing to connect from an offside position with Radja Nainggolan\xe2\x80\x99s cross from the right.</p> <p>When Roma\xe2\x80\x99s goal came it was via a moment of beautiful incision through the heart of this City team. The instant pass from Nainggolan to release Totti was delicious: even better was Totti\xe2\x80\x99s turning of his back on the ball to allow it to arc in behind him and into his path with a ballroom dancer\xe2\x80\x99s timing.</p> <p>Joe Hart slipped a little as he rushed out but again, two years on from Andrea Pirlo\xe2\x80\x99s rather mocking \xe2\x80\x9cspoon\xe2\x80\x9d in Kiev, an ageing Italian had made him take a seat.</p> <p>The goalkeeper, to his credit, made some fine saves at close quarters later in the match and City did enough in the second half to have won the game as David Silva began to assert himself: Cole\xe2\x80\x99s late lunging block as Silva burst into the box was a moment to treasure.</p> <p>It has by all accounts been a slightly rocky start for Cole in Rome. Here, back on home turf, he looked the familiar model of low-throttle excellence.</p>           '
