b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho must feel this is a special achievement even by his standards | Barney Ronay'


b'<p>On a balmy afternoon at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea produced a display of orderly, low\xe2\x80\x91throttle, title\xe2\x80\x91bound football that always seemed to be heading just one way. With a few moments left Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho could be seen wandering along the touchline to clasp hands sombrely with Alan Pardew and even offer a little kiss on the cheek, completing the sense of a match that had felt from the start like a composed, quietly celebratory viking funeral for the Premier League title race.</p> <p>At the end of which Chelsea are champions, and a genuinely fine achievement for Mourinho \xe2\x80\x93 who now has eight league titles in 12 years across three countries \xe2\x80\x93 deserves to be celebrated. The last time Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s manager won the Premier League he ended up hurling his medal into the Chelsea fans behind the goal in the Matthew Harding stand. This time you suspect he might just want to hang on to his own memento of a victory that is likely to feel like a special one even for the Special One.</p>           Video: Dominic Fifield talks to Chelsea fans about winning the title, the performances of captain John Terry, and the \xe2\x80\x98boring\xe2\x80\x99 tag given to their team.     <p>Not because, when it finally arrives, this will be a first significant piece of silverware in three years, a moment to reburnish Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s winning lustre after a mid-career clearing of the throat. But above all because another league title is a remarkable achievement in its own right.</p> <p>There is an element of history being made here. Mourinho is now the first manager in English league history to return to a former champion club and win the league title again. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my country we say all the time don\xe2\x80\x99t go back to where you were happy before,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho noted afterwards, and with good reason. There have been 52 other title-winning managers: none of them have ever done this before.</p>  <p> Related: Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s 2014-15 Premier League title-winning squad: how they rate | Dominic Fifield </p>   <p>In a similar vein Mourinho is only the fifth manager in 122 years of league football to win league titles 10 years apart, after Sir Alex Ferguson, Sir Matt Busby and the Victorian secretary managers George Ramsey of Aston Villa and Tom Watson of Liverpool and Sunderland.</p> <p>There will be the usual caveats in victory from those outside Stamford Bridge, from the mediocrity of the league this year to the widespread aesthetic objections that seem to suggest the meat-and-potatoes English football fan has now been transformed into a kind of armchair Oscar Wilde, holding a lavender-scented kerchief to his nose at the spectacle of well-organised, versatile winning football.</p> <p>Frankly, though, watching Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s players cavort in the blue and white ticker-tape at the end of a match in which the champions strolled over the line with six defenders on the pitch, and a near-immobile 37-year-old centre-forward, it is hard to see anything but a triumph of management, based around two key decisions.</p>  <p> Related: Chelsea v Crystal Palace - in pictures </p>   <p>First, Mourinho acted quickly last summer. Chelsea needed a striker, a left-back and a new central midfielder. Diego Costa, Filipe Lu\xc3\xads and Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas duly arrived, a net summer spend of \xc2\xa35m, enough to transform a slightly clanky team into champions.</p> <p>Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s second decisive moment came as Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s flying start was gummed by injury and fatigue. It is this, the change to a more pragmatic style from autumn to winter, that the self-appointed purists have bemoaned. In fact, it is here Mourinho deserves most credit.</p> <p>The moment that squished, decisively, any sense of a wobble was the Capital One Cup final. With Nemanja Matic suspended Chelsea played four central defenders, won 2-0 and haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked back since, conceding five goals in nine matches and taking 23 points from 27. Arsenal, Manchester United and Manchester City have also had tough patches. The difference is none have coped so well with the difficult moments. Had Arsenal, for example, shunted some willing Kurt Zouma-equivalent into midfield and defended with neurotic caution when times were hard earlier in the season they might have been more than energetic pursuers.</p> <p>Indeed, at times this decisive 1-0 defeat of Crystal Palace felt a bit like a playful riff on Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s season to date. Predictably enough Eden Hazard made the difference towards the end of a familiarly tight first half. First the PFA player of the yearburst on to Willian\xe2\x80\x99s cute flick only to tumble in a collision with James McArthur. Hazard was clever enough to leave the referee with little choice but to award a penalty, and then directed a well-judged header into the corner after his kick was saved by Juli\xc3\xa1n Speroni.</p> <p>And that, to Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s credit, was pretty much that.</p> <p>It isn\xe2\x80\x99t hard to see what these evolving champions need to do from here. To compete in both domestic and Champions Leagues Chelsea need a new striker. They also need a high-quality central midfielder: a little more energy alongside Matic might just free up his own qualities as a passer and playmaker. Beyond that Mourinho will hopefully look to address the horribly tangled web of Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s army of loan players, and also to make good on his promise to blood some homegrown talent. The failure to call on Dominic Solanke or Ruben Loftus-Cheek, even from the bench, when Chelsea have been crying out for a striker and a central midfielder is the one disappointment of a season that has ended in well-merited \xe2\x80\x93 and indeed instructive \xe2\x80\x93 triumph.</p>'
