b'Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s Louis van Gaal tells Radamel Falcao he can leave'


b'<p>Radamel Falcao has been told by Louis van Gaal he is not wanted at Manchester United next season.</p> <p>The centre\xe2\x80\x91forward will return to Monaco following a season-long loan that cost the club \xc2\xa316m and yielded four goals, the last of which was on 31 January in a 3-1 win over Leicester City at Old Trafford. The Colombia forward, 29, made 17 starts in all competitions as he struggled to recapture his best form following a long lay-off for the serious knee injury he suffered at the start of last year.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFalcao is a top professional and a good human being,\xe2\x80\x9d said Van Gaal. \xe2\x80\x9cOn behalf of myself and everyone at the club I would like to wish him well for the future.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Falcao is understood to want to play on in the Premier League, preferably at Chelsea or Arsenal, but his departure means Van Gaal will require at least one new striker next season. This could rise to two as the club will listen to offers for Robin van Persie .</p>'
