b'Newcastle United consider R\xc3\xa9mi Garde as next manager'


b'<p>Newcastle United seem increasingly likely to recruit from abroad as their search for Alan Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s replacement intensifies.</p> <p>R\xc3\xa9mi Garde, the former Lyon coach, Thomas Tuchel, previously in charge of Mainz, and St Etienne\xe2\x80\x99s Christophe Galtier are all under consideration as Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s work out a shortlist for a new manager. </p> <p>None of the leading contenders are british. Steve McClaren commands admiration inside St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park, but the former England and Middlesbrough coach is committed to remaining at Derby and feels it would be disloyal to his players to depart in the middle of a promotion push.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going nowhere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said on Tuesday. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to let people here down. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to show loyalty. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a job to do here.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>If the possibility of Newcastle changing McClaren\xe2\x80\x99s mind appears virtually non-existent, Mike Ashley does not lack candidates as he considers appointing the first overseas coach of his time at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park. Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s owner has delegated the hunt for the new manager \xe2\x80\x93 or \xe2\x80\x9chead coach\xe2\x80\x9d, as the club term it \xe2\x80\x93 to Graham Carr, his influential chief scout, and Lee Charnley, the managing director. After signing a raft of players from Ligue Un, Carr has excellent contacts in France in particular.</p> <p>Both he and Charnley have made it clear they are not interested in candidates seeking transfer-market autonomy but want a tracksuit coach happy to leave recruitment to a director-of-football figure.</p> <p>Carr is said to have been impressed with Garde\xe2\x80\x99s work at Lyon before his resignation for personal reasons last May. The 48-year-old former Arsenal defensive midfielder cited a combination of exhaustion and family concerns as prompting his decision to quit but Carr may try to persuade him a change is as good as a rest.</p> <p>Tuchel stepped down at Mainz last spring, saying he needed a year out. Still under contract in Germany, his move to Tyneside would involve Newcastle compensating the Bundesliga club. Tuchel has gained a reputation as a bright, innovative coach adept at improving players. Big on squad rotation the 41-year-old is teetotal and relaxes by designing furniture. Many in Europe hype him as the new J\xc3\xbcrgen Klopp but Tuchel has remained adamant he intends to spend an entire 12 months out of the game.</p> <p>With St Etienne fourth in France, Galtier has pledged not to depart until the summer at the earliest. He has figured on Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s radar when Pardew looked a little wobbly. Now they could be tempted to test his resolve. Once again compensation would be involved but the club \xe2\x80\x93 who received a reported \xc2\xa33.5m from Crystal Palace for Pardew \xe2\x80\x93 have let it be known they are prepared to pay for the right man.</p> <p>There was a rash of betting on Temuri Ketsbaia, the former Newcastle midfielder and Georgia national team coach, on Tuesday but it would be a major shock if he got the job. While other foreign candidates are also under consideration as the shortlist is finalised, British candidates including Bournemouth\xe2\x80\x99s Eddie Howe, Glenn Hoddle and John Carver appear to have been discounted.</p> <p>Yet Hoddle, currently coaching at QPR, knows Carr well from their time working together at Tottenham and could be seen as an attractive short-term option should Newcastle decide to bide their time until the summer. Although Carver, currently the caretaker, wants the job, Newcastle intend to make an external appointment and do not see him as a long-term contender. A disappointing home draw with Burnley and FA Cup defeat at Leicester have diminished his chances of being kept on in temporary charge until the end of the season.</p> <p>Carver, however, is preparing the team for Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Chelsea assisted by Peter Beardsley and Steve Stone. With no appointment expected this week, he is likely to be in the dugout at Stamford Bridge.</p>'
