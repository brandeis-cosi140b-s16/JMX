b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho: I was wrong to suggest a campaign against Chelsea'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has said he regrets his use of the word \xe2\x80\x9ccampaign\xe2\x80\x9d when complaining about decisions made against his Chelsea side over the turn of the year, though the champions\xe2\x80\x99 manager stands by his assertion his team had been victims of oversights by match officials.</p> <p>He had been incensed when Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas was denied a penalty in the draw at Southampton in December after a foul by Matt Targett. F\xc3\xa0bregas was booked for diving by Anthony Taylor, with several other perceived incidents of simulation having been previously highlighted involving Diego Costa, Willian, Gary Cahill and Branislav Ivanovic. Mourinho suggested a \xe2\x80\x9cclear campaign\xe2\x80\x9d had been instigated against his team, with the Football Association subsequently fining him \xc2\xa325,000.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not the kind of person to regret,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho, who had pointed to pundits, rival coaches and commentators reacting to Chelsea in a different way to other teams. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you did you did. What happened happened. You cannot change things. Time does not go back. We had lots of mistakes against us. That\xe2\x80\x99s the reality but that\xe2\x80\x99s football. Maybe \xe2\x80\x98campaign\xe2\x80\x99 is not a nice word. Maybe I would take that word out from my explanation and my comments, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the reality. We had very bad decisions over a big period of time. But I also made bad decisions, so no problem.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe word \xe2\x80\x98campaign\xe2\x80\x99 was even the subject of punishment because the word was strong. My feeling was that we had lots of mistakes against us, that punished us in crucial matches in a crucial period \xe2\x80\x93 November, December, January. I would take the word \xe2\x80\x98campaign\xe2\x80\x99 [out] if the same happened next season. It would be out of my vocabulary. But that feeling is clear. We had lots of decisions against us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>will hoist their first Premier League trophy in five years after Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s finale against Sunderland but speaking to the BBC, Mourinho pondered a future away from Stamford Bridge. \xe2\x80\x9cThe day Mr Abramovich thinks I am not good enough for Chelsea, I want to work, and if possible in England too,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho told Football Focus.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAny club comes to me now and offers me a fantastic project, offers me twice my wages in the contract at Chelsea, no chance. I see myself coaching another club, but I love Chelsea and I am in Mr Abramovich\xe2\x80\x99s hands and until then I am here.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In the mean time, the manager is targeting further progress next term, not least in the Champions League. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have to win more to be considered great,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOne title is not enough. Next season it will be a new type of Champions League, with different combinations in the last 16. It will be a Champions League where Real Madrid are among the second pot of seeds. A lot of big clubs \xe2\x80\x93 Manchester City, Manchester United, Arsenal \xe2\x80\x93 will not be in the first pot, so who are they going to cross with in the group stage? Lots of big teams will finish second, meaning they will be up against big teams who finish first. Those seedings are completely fair. Obviously I\xe2\x80\x99d prefer Real Madrid with all the big guys in my group of seeds, but it\xe2\x80\x99s fair. The first pot are for champions, whether they have won in England, Holland or Portugal.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
