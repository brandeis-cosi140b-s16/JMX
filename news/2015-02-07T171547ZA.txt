b'Aston Villa 1-2 Chelsea | Premier League match report'


b'<p>It ended with Chelsea moving seven points clear at the top of the Premier League and maybe even the semblance of a smile from the man who came back to English football insisting he wanted to be known as the Happy One. Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s scowl has felt like a permanent attachment in recent times but this felt like a significant moment in the Premier League title race and it was not straightforward seeing off an Aston Villa side that had at least paid attention to the photograph of an empty goal splashed across the front of the Birmingham Mail. \xe2\x80\x9cMemo to Villa,\xe2\x80\x9d it read. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is what a goal looks like.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Paul Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s side certainly needed the reminder, bearing in mind the moment when Jores Okore headed in Carles Gil\xe2\x80\x99s cross to make it 1-1, three minutes into the second half, brought up the 11-hour mark since their last top-division goal 43 days earlier. So, hallelujah, Villa have finally managed to equal the number of league goals Bournemouth have scored in Birmingham this season.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Villa, there have still been only two occasions all season when they have scored twice in a league game and Chelsea had enough time and self-belief to restore their winning position through Branislav Ivanovic\xe2\x80\x99s decisive strike.</p>  <p> Related: Everton 0-0 Liverpool | Premier League match report </p>   <p>Ivanovic is establishing himself as the ultimate odd job man \xe2\x80\x93 a full-back, centre-half, attacker, motivator and goalscorer all wrapped into one \xe2\x80\x93 and this was his fifth goal in his past six starts against Villa. There was still a third of the match to play but Villa had resorted to type and Christian Benteke\xe2\x80\x99s introduction, having been dropped from Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s starting XI, had little impact.</p> <p>Mourinho brought on Juan Cuadrado, the \xc2\xa323m acquisition from Fiorentina, during those moments and Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s inability to beat Hull City at their own ground ultimately made it a hugely satisfying win for the leaders. True, they might have made easier work of it bearing in mind Eden Hazard opened the scoring with a superbly worked team goal after only eight minutes. They did, however, show title-winning qualities in their response to Villa\xe2\x80\x99s first league goal in 2015 and, on the balance of play, they were clearly the better side.</p> <p>Mourinho tried to argue that seven points amounted to \xe2\x80\x9cnothing\xe2\x80\x9d in a league where \xe2\x80\x9cnothing surprises me\xe2\x80\x9d. They missed Diego Costa at times and it was a difficult day for Didier Drogba, a month short of his 37th birthday and struggling to remind us of the player of old, barring those moments when he was flinging himself to the ground in pretend agony.</p> <p>Yet Mourinho was twirling his hand in the air after the final whistle and his celebrations indicated he knew what an important victory this might be.</p>  <p> Related: Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 Arsenal | Premier League match report </p>   <p>Early on, it had looked like it would be a much more routine win when Drogba played the ball forward and Oscar, running through the inside-right channel, eluded Okore then played it inside for Willian. Hazard had anticipated the next pass, darting in front of Alan Hutton, and Willian delivered it with just the right amount of weight for his team-mate to turn a first-time shot past Brad Guzan.</p> <p>The frustration inside Villa Park manifested itself in some voluble dissent aimed towards Tom Cleverley. Lambert could be seen taking exception to something that Rui Faria, Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s assistant, had said in the opposite dugout and was suspicious to learn that the Chelsea manager had described Villa\xe2\x80\x99s squad as \xe2\x80\x9cone of the best\xe2\x80\x9d in the country, with a \xe2\x80\x9cvery good bench and lots of solutions\xe2\x80\x9d. There is history here and Lambert, with two wins in 20 league games since signing his new contract, did not appreciate the flattery. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s his opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe he is trying to put pressure on me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>If nothing else, Mourinho was guilty of serious exaggeration, especially given the way Willian, Oscar and Hazard endangered the home defence. Villa\xe2\x80\x99s scoring drought had gone on so long there were supporters holding up posters with arrows to show the way to goal. Gil, a \xc2\xa33.2m signing from Valencia, looks like he might be a bargain and it was a beautiful little drop of the shoulder to fool Oscar before his cross picked out Okore at the back post.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Villa, Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s players could not follow the crowd\xe2\x80\x99s instructions again. Chelsea found some new impetus and when C\xc3\xa9sar Azpilicueta\xe2\x80\x99s perseverance created the chance for Ivanovic he let fly with a left-foot shot that was still rising as it flew into the net.</p>'
