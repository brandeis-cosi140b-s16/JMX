b'Chelsea v Paris Saint-Germain: Champions League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened!'


b'<p>PSG milk the acclaim of their fans, as Chelsea players trudge off. The home side were outplayed, outfought and out-thought - by 10 men. Mourinho is an expert at muddying waters with his extra-curricular comments, but tonight it was his team who looked confused. They did not play with freedom, as if their minds were cluttered with guff and negativity. That\xe2\x80\x99s a shame considering some of the players they have. Mind you, Cesc Fabregas and the rest of that midfield? Totally bossed by Marco Verratti, Blaise Matuidi and Thiago Motta. </p>     PSG celebrates victory.
