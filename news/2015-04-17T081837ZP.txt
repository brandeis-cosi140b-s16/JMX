b'Pep Guardiola will become Manchester City manager, claims Paul Scholes'


b'<p>Paul Scholes has claimed Pep Guardiola will become Manchester City manager when his contract ends with Bayern Munich at the end of next season.</p> <p>The Spaniard has previously stated he will serve all three years of his term at the German club, ending in the summer of 2016.</p> <p>Manuel Pellegrini is under severe pressure as City manager due to a slump in form that has left the champions fourth, having been joint top on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day with Chelsea.</p> <p>Guardiola is City\xe2\x80\x99s No1 choice to become manager and as the club does not favour Real Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s Carlo Ancelotti, Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s Diego Simeone, Napoli\xe2\x80\x99s Rafael Ben\xc3\xadtez or J\xc3\xbcrgen Klopp, who is leaving Borussia Dortmund in the close season, City may consider a stop-gap appointment until Guardiola is available.</p> <p>If correct, Scholes\xe2\x80\x99 claim would support this strategy. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the information that comes back to me in Manchester is that Pep Guardiola will take that job when his contract at Bayern Munich expires in one year\xe2\x80\x99s time,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote in his column for the Independent. He adds of Klopp: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no doubt in my mind that he would be a success in English football, the only question is at which club.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Scholes does not believe there is currently a British manager who can take a club to the final stages of the Champions League. He believes Guardiola and Klopp could do so. \xe2\x80\x9cBoth these men have played a major role in European football over the last six or seven years. Both of them have won their domestic leagues and, in the case of Guardiola, two Champions Leagues with Barcelona. They would bring a lot to our Premier League in terms of their personalities, their expertise and the potential rivalries with some of the big managers already here.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is a British manager who is currently capable of restoring English clubs to the final stages of the Champions League, and winning the competition again. I take no pleasure in offering that verdict but unfortunately it is the way things are at the moment. I hope that it will change in the future and I have high hopes that my friend Ryan Giggs will be handed the reins at Manchester United at some point having served an apprenticeship under Louis van Gaal.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
