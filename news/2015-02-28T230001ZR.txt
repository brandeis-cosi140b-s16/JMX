b'Ramires ready to step up for Chelsea in Capital One Cup final with Tottenham'


b'<p>The number of distractions around Chelsea has arguably been unbecoming of a Capital One Cup final week and it might be fitting if one of their quieter men emerges from the noise to make an impact at Wembley on Sunday. Ramires is the likely beneficiary of Nemanja Matic\xe2\x80\x99s two-game suspension and the Brazilian, by no means a regular starter these days but often relied upon as a horse for the big-game course, feels that there is lost time to make up for.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had the best of seasons,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI suffered a few injuries and had a setback that pushed me back. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m fit and the team is in need of someone to step in. If I\xe2\x80\x99m able to play I\xe2\x80\x99ll do whatever needs doing, and hopefully we can win this trophy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ramires took time to recover from an abductor muscle injury sustained at Manchester City in September, but has returned to form as what Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho last month called \xe2\x80\x9cthe best Ramires\xe2\x80\x9d in recent weeks. Realistically, just as relevant to his lack of playing time has been the form of Matic and Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas as Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s central pair; Ramires\xe2\x80\x99s athleticism and presence in both boxes make him a viable replacement for either and he recently deputised during F\xc3\xa0bregas\xe2\x80\x99s lay-off. But he has started alongside both in high-stakes fixtures such as last week\xe2\x80\x99s draw at Paris Saint-Germain and that match at the Etihad, and his record of decisive moments on the big stage \xe2\x80\x93 memories of his goalscoring contributions in the 2012 FA Cup final and the same season\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League semi-final win over Barcelona remain vivid \xe2\x80\x93 is strong.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI had a major role when we won the Champions League,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cBut players go through different phases in their careers within the same club. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had an injury and lost a lot of playing time. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a very good squad with big competition; anyone could play but only 11 get on the pitch. When I don\xe2\x80\x99t play, maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit moody \xe2\x80\x93 but in my head I think competition is good to keep everyone on their toes.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He is certainly the most practiced of stand-ins and will come across another Brazilian understudy at Wembley. The oft-maligned Paulinho may not start for Tottenham Hotspur but the pair have a close relationship \xe2\x80\x93 as might any two people who were given the hopeless task of entering the pitch as half-time substitutes with Brazil 5-0 down in a World Cup semi-final against Germany.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re actually very, very good friends off the pitch,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cNot only myself but also our families. My wife is good friends with his wife and they spend a lot of time together. So it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be very interesting playing against him. We both know it\xe2\x80\x99s a big, big game. On the pitch there are no friends, but then life goes on and friendship goes on as well.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t be talking to him before the game, there\xe2\x80\x99s already enough stuff going around, so I\xe2\x80\x99m just going to leave that. I know he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to text or call me either, and I prefer it that way.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>While the pair have that chastening summer experience in common, Ramires says that winning silverware against Tottenham would not serve to salve the wounds it inflicted.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThese are two absolutely different things. This is a final with Chelsea. What happened in the World Cup happened with the national team and the only thing that can make that any better will be in the next tournament playing for Brazil.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ramires was again a half-time replacement in Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s 5-3 defeat at White Hart Lane on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day. His introduction at 3-1 down did something to staunch the home side\xe2\x80\x99s flow but he is expecting a tighter affair from the beginning this time.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be similar to other games we\xe2\x80\x99ve played before,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThose were open games \xe2\x80\x93 they won at home, we won at home. Now we are playing at Wembley for a title and it might be more of a close game, at least at the beginning \xe2\x80\x93 a completely different story.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>If the \xe2\x80\x9cbest Ramires\xe2\x80\x9d turns up again, then it might yet be one that Chelsea supporters have been happy to read before.</p>'
