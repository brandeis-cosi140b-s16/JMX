b"Sean Dyche summons underdog spirit for Burnley's Premier League mission | Andy Hunter"


b'<p>Burnley are confronted by another level and another financial world but find themselves surrounded by a familiar school of thought. &quot;It is no different to last season,&quot; insists Sean Dyche. &quot;We were written off, called the underdogs, sixth favourites for relegation, bottom-six budget, all the rest of it.&quot; He is adamant underwhelming expectation will not be the only parallel with this campaign.</p> <p>There are, however, fundamental differences between last season&apos;s stylish promotion campaign and the return of Premier League football to Turf Moor after a four-year absence. Dyche is now operating on a &quot;bottom one&quot; budget for a start, and plans to strengthen a slender squad with &quot;good players in the Championship and maybe the odd one out of the Premier League&quot; have been hindered by Fulham&apos;s willingness to pay Leeds United \xc2\xa311m for Ross McCormack. &quot;That one has definitely raised the bar financially,&quot; the 43-year-old concedes.</p> <p>Dyche has secured Premier League experience in Matt Taylor, Michael Kightly and Steven Reid plus Championship strikers Lukas Jutkiewicz and Marvin Sordell, all players he believes can adapt to the tactical demands and passing game that guided Burnley to promotion with two matches to spare last season. But there have been frequent frustrations in the market and the opener against Chelsea, polished to the tune of \xc2\xa375m this summer, exposes the divide that Dyche&apos;s team must overcome.</p> <p>&quot;The group is powerful, I believe in it,&quot; he counters. &quot;We&apos;re demanding and I think we played some very good football last season, we had some great times, so it can be done. Obviously now we&apos;ve come to a whole different level. The Championship is unbelievably competitive but, with all due respect, there&apos;s not the quality of the Premier League.</p> <p>&quot;Chelsea signed [Diego] Costa and someone told me the other day that, including the contract, the deal is roughly equivalent to our first year&apos;s turnover. For one player. That&apos;s where we are. We have to run the whole club on that one player&apos;s fee, salary, roughly speaking, and that is the gap. There are gaps in all levels of football but the Premier League is probably the biggest one, unless you have the sugar daddies who constantly support the club financially.&quot;</p> <p>There are no sugar daddies at Turf Moor, though the co-chairmen John Banaszkiewicz and Mike Garlick helped soften their boyhood club&apos;s losses in the Championship. They also tied Dyche to a new contract following a promotion that was ideally timed with parachute payments from Turf Moor&apos;s last, brief Premier League stay finishing last season.</p> <p>Burnley posted an \xc2\xa38m loss in 2012-13 and sold their leading striker Charlie Austinlast summer as a consequence. Jay Rodriguez&apos;s sale to Southampton overturned projected losses of \xc2\xa34.4m the previous year. The Premier League return has helped Burnley resist interest in last season&apos;s leading goalscorer Danny Ings but no risks will be taken with the club&apos;s financial future.</p> <p>Dyche maintains: &quot;Our way of bridging the gap is to believe in the group, to work hard on the training pitch and tick all the boxes in proper fashion \xe2\x80\x93 sports science, analysis. We&apos;ll have the freedom of underdogs, arguably the biggest underdogs in recent times in the Premier League, but that brings scope to improve and to play with freedom. The pressure is on some of the other teams who will be expected to beat us.</p> <p>&quot;Our demand is high. I&apos;m a young manager, ambitious. I want my staff and the group to be ambitious. We&apos;re not here just for fluff, to think &apos;isn&apos;t it lovely!&apos; My demand is to win. We give the players a lot of education. I&apos;m not a nightclub bouncer, I just look like one. I think deeply about what I do and we try and use as many things as we can.&quot;</p> <p>Taylor arrived at Turf Moor on a free from West Ham United only in July but describes Burnley&apos;s dressing room as &quot;probably the best I&apos;ve been in in terms of camaraderie&quot;. He believes Burnley&apos;s more earthy charms and lack of pretension will assist the club&apos;s survival mission this season. &quot;I&apos;d liken the football club to Portsmouth, it&apos;s got that feel about it,&quot; says the midfielder. &quot;It is an older-style ground, the changing rooms for the away team aren&apos;t wonderful and when the ball goes out for a goal-kick you can hear what the fans are saying to you. That was something we turned into a positive at Portsmouth because we loved playing there with 18,000-19,000 fans screaming for us.</p> <p>&quot;People didn&apos;t like going there. They don&apos;t like it when they arrive, maybe things aren&apos;t quite as prim and proper as they&apos;re used to, and we turned that into something that was a real game-changer for us at Portsmouth. I believe we&apos;ve got the opportunity to do that here.&quot;</p>'
