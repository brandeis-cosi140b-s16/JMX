b'Blackburn Rovers v Swansea City: match preview'


b'<p>Swansea, after suffering their heaviest defeat in over 20 years against Chelsea last week, will no doubt want to redeem themselves when they meet Blackburn Rovers on Saturday. Despite an emphatic 6-2 victory over Tranmere in the previous round, question marks surround the ability of Garry Monk\xe2\x80\x99s side to hit the net following the sale of Wilfried Bony. His departure offers an opportunity to Baf\xc3\xa9timbi Gomis but, as of yet, he has failed wholly to live up to expectations. Blackburn will relish the opportunity to host Premier League opposition as they look to strengthen their position in the Championship and push towards the play-off places.
