b'John Terry says Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s title collapse last season left him in tears'


b'<p>John Terry has admitted he was reduced to tears by the wasteful end to Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League title challenge last season, but is confident the additions to the spine of Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s team have strengthened their challenge this time around.</p> <p>There was a period towards the end of the last campaign when the London club had their destiny in their own hands, only to drop points wastefully at Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and, most damagingly of all, at home to Sunderland and Norwich City. That left them trailing in third behind Manchester City and Liverpool, though the arrival of Diego Costa and Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas, and the continued development of Nemanja Matic, have hoisted their ambitions.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was in tears over the Premier League last year, over throwing that away and not winning it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Terry. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I play for week in, week out. I\xe2\x80\x99m never scared to show my emotions. I just want to win trophies, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m born to do, it\xe2\x80\x99s in me from when I was a kid. I just want to win games, whether that\xe2\x80\x99s in the Premier League or the Champions League.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThose three signings are quality, all unbelievable players but big characters as well, on and off the pitch. What I call real men, and players with great experience as well. Matic had to come to Portugal [with Benfica] and gain experience, but came back to Chelsea a completely different player and a man now. He was superb again against Sporting. Cesc has been in England before so he knew what to expect, and you expect him to hit the ground running, which he\xe2\x80\x99s done.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWith Diego we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it before: some strikers take months and months. But he\xe2\x80\x99s hit the ground running. Eight goals already is superb and it\xe2\x80\x99s great for us. He\xe2\x80\x99s a good character, a great character. Without speaking a word of English he gets by and gets on great with everyone. He puts himself about but gets up and battles on, and plays with little niggles. That\xe2\x80\x99s what you want. That\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s come to the Premier League: to win. He made that clear to everyone in pre-season. He\xe2\x80\x99s come here to win trophies. That\xe2\x80\x99s what he wants to do.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Terry raised a century of appearances in the Champions League proper \xe2\x80\x93 he is the sixth Englishman to achieve that landmark \xe2\x80\x93 in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s victory at Sporting Lisbon having made his debut in the competition 11 years ago in a 2-0 home defeat to Besiktas. The European Cup has been cruel to him at times in the seasons since, most notably with his miss in the penalty shootout in the final in 2008 with the trophy within reach, and the red card he accrued for kicking Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez, then with Barcelona, in the semi-final four years later. He will confront the Chilean again at Stamford Bridge on Sunday when Arsenal make the trip across the capital seeking to avenge last season\xe2\x80\x99s 6-0 defeat in the same fixture.</p> <p>The Chelsea captain, who signed a new one-year contract in the summer, still aspires to claiming the Champions League with the club. \xe2\x80\x9cThere have been many [highlights] over the years but, when we beat Bar\xc3\xa7a and Bayern Munich in the early days, the first taste of it\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d said the centre-half. \xe2\x80\x9cBut for me the most important thing is not just the 100 appearances but to strive to go on and win it again for the club. On a personal note I\xe2\x80\x99m delighted to reach that many games, it\xe2\x80\x99s a great achievement, I think only 28 players have done it. So to stay in a great side for that long and to play that many games is an honour.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI hope this team is good enough to win it again. That\xe2\x80\x99s obviously the target, the mentality of where we are as a club, and it has been for the last 10 years or so since the owner came in. With Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho back in now, that\xe2\x80\x99s our target and that\xe2\x80\x99s the standard. Maybe 10 years ago when we first came into it that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the expectation but now, with the money that\xe2\x80\x99s been invested, the players we have and the experience we have in the competition, that\xe2\x80\x99s always the target.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m still driven on by missing the final two years ago. The biggest night ever for the club, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t play in it. But I played in one [in Moscow] and I felt a massive part of it, and the players made me feel a huge part of Munich. Along the way you look back at games, like the Napoli game [in the 2012 last-16 tie] and others where you played a big part as well. But, because it\xe2\x80\x99s me, people look and say: \xe2\x80\x98He\xe2\x80\x99s not won it.\xe2\x80\x99 People like to have their digs and their pops, but I know I played a huge part, in the dressing room and on the field as well, so I count myself to have won it. No one speaks about the other 10 players who weren\xe2\x80\x99t on the pitch that night in Munich as well. Maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s me and that\xe2\x80\x99s where I am at as a player.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
