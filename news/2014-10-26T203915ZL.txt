b'Louis van Gaal: Robin van Persie was \xe2\x80\x98stupid\xe2\x80\x99 for taking his shirt off'


b'<p>Robin van Persie rescued a point for Manchester United with a late equaliser against Chelsea and was then branded \xe2\x80\x9cstupid\xe2\x80\x9d by Louis van Gaal for taking his shirt off in celebration and drawing a booking from Phil Dowd, the referee.</p> <p>Chelsea were leading until the fourth minute of stoppage time through Didier Drogba\xe2\x80\x99s 53rd-minute opener \xe2\x80\x93 his first league goal since returning to the club. Then \xc3\x81ngel di Mar\xc3\xada was fouled by Branislav Ivanovic in a challenge deemed bookable. As this was the defender\xe2\x80\x99s second yellow card he was sent off by Dowd, a decision that angered Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho.</p> <p>From the free-kick Van Persie slotted his third goal of the campaign and hurled his shirt in the air. Van Gaal said: \xe2\x80\x9cHe did a stupid reaction after the goal. You can be excited but you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to pull your shirt off because then you have a yellow card. It is not so smart.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Gaal was insistent that despite requiring the late finish to secure the draw, United deserved to win. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, you know that. I think Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho knows that also,\xe2\x80\x9d said the manager.</p> <p>Although the result came against the leaders, Van Gaal does not believe it was his side\xe2\x80\x99s finest display. \xe2\x80\x9cI have said that to the boys. It was not our best performance and that is a pity because at this moment you have to show yourself against the better teams but in spite of that we have created a lot of chances \xe2\x80\x93 much more than Chelsea. They have created one chance in the first half and before the goal there was the [Eden] Hazard chance which David de Gea stopped fantastically.</p>           Louis van Gaal: Manchester United not at best against Chelsea \xe2\x80\x93 link to video    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe corner kick [for Drogba\xe2\x80\x99s goal] was a lack of communication and that is why they scored. That is always the difference in such games.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho hailed a \xe2\x80\x9cfantastic\xe2\x80\x9d performance from Chelsea but pointed to Dowd\xe2\x80\x99s decision regarding Ivanovic\xe2\x80\x99s challenge on Di Mar\xc3\xada. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no comments on the referee,\xe2\x80\x9d the Portuguese said, before claiming that if he did offer his true feelings there would be disciplinary action against him from the Football Association.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI prefer just to say my feeling is we had a good first half and a fantastic second half. You know I cannot speak. Some [managers] can and some don\xe2\x80\x99t and one of the ones who cannot speak is me because you know what happens to me when I do.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI prefer not to speak about the second yellow card because if I do I have to start in the first half and go through many, many things that happened in the game. The penalty [not given] on Ivanovic, the accumulation of cards, the fouls he didn\xe2\x80\x99t give to us, the throw-ins right in front of me and the fourth official and the linesman that he gave in the other direction.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea lead Southampton by four points and Manchester City, the champions, by six. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I prefer to be in front,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are four points in front so I can say next weekend it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what the results, we will be on top of the league. We have a little space for our mistakes, or the referee\xe2\x80\x99s mistakes.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Gaal revealed that Phil Jones has shin splints. \xe2\x80\x9cWest Bromwich Albion [was] his first game after long injury. I brought him back and he played 90 minutes. He had a sore shin \xe2\x80\x93 shin splints is very painful. He could not continue training on Saturday. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long it will take [before he recovers].\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
