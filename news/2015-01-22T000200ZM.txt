b'Manchester United tipped to overtake Real Madrid at top of money league'


b'<p>Last season may have been disastrous on the pitch for Manchester United but off it the club have reaped the benefits of huge commercial growth to narrow the gap to Real Madrid in the battle to be the world\xe2\x80\x99s highest-earning club.</p> <p>According to this year\xe2\x80\x99s Deloitte Money League, which uses publicly available accounts to rank the revenues of the biggest clubs, United jumped two places from fourth to second with revenues of \xc2\xa3433.2m. Their growth was partly fuelled by their commercial strategy of selling regional sponsorship categories around the world but also by the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s broadcasting deals that bring in \xc2\xa35.5bn over three years.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDespite a poor on-pitch season in 2013-14, United\xe2\x80\x99s commercial strategy of securing global and regional partners is delivering substantial growth. Commercial revenue has grown 83% in the last three years,\xe2\x80\x9d said Austin Houlihan, a senior manager at Deloitte. \xe2\x80\x9cThanks to the latest Premier League media deals, broadcast revenue also increased 34% to \xc2\xa3135.8m. Their absence this season from European competition will be felt in next year\xe2\x80\x99s Money League position, but if they can return to the Champions League in 2015-16 there is a strong possibility they could be top in two years\xe2\x80\x99 time.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>       <p>While their absence from European competition this season will dent revenues in next year\xe2\x80\x99s list, a return to Champions League football combined with the impact of a new \xc2\xa3750m, 10-year deal with Adidas will help boost revenues further and could enable them to overhaul Real as the highest earners in world football.</p> <p>The United model, minted by the chief executive, Ed Woodward, of selling regional sponsorships in a range of categories, is now being copied by other clubs but they have some way to go to catch up.</p> <p>The huge growth in broadcasting income and the relatively equitable way in which it is shared between the 20 clubs meant that half of the places in the Money League top 40 were taken up by clubs from the top division in England. Newcastle United and Everton are new entries in the top 20, joining the six clubs \xe2\x80\x93 United, Manchester City, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur \xe2\x80\x93 on last year\xe2\x80\x99s list.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s new broadcast deals have translated into big revenue increases across the English top flight. In fact, every Premier League club reported record revenues in 2013-14. Between them, the eight English clubs in our top 20 achieved total broadcast revenues of \xc2\xa30.9bn,\xe2\x80\x9d said Houlihan. \xe2\x80\x9cThat all the clubs in the Premier League are in the top 40 is testament to the huge appeal of the league globally and also the equality of the distributions the clubs enjoy relative to their European counterparts.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>       <p>Broadcasting revenue, which along with commercial income is becoming disproportionately important in relation to gate receipts, is likely to rise further for Premier League clubs when the results of the ongoing auction for live rights are announced next month. BT Sport and Sky are going head to head for the rights and once overseas sales, highlights and clips packages are taken into account, the total could top \xc2\xa37bn over three years.</p> <p>Dan Jones, partner in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte said that the gap between the haves and have-nots in European football would get ever wider, with the \xe2\x80\x9cbig five\xe2\x80\x9d leagues continuing to grow faster than their rivals.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough only Manchester United and Real Madrid have gone past the \xe2\x82\xac500m [\xc2\xa3418m] revenue marker so far, we predict that all of the top five clubs may reach that point by next year,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jones. \xe2\x80\x9cCommercial and broadcast revenues are now more important than ever to clubs to enable them to compete financially and put the best talent on the pitch. This has led to further dominance from the \xe2\x80\x98big five\xe2\x80\x99 European leagues this year, with just Galatasaray making it in from outside of those leagues.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
