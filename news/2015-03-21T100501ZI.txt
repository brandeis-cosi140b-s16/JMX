b'I\xe2\x80\x99ll restore Radamel Falcao\xe2\x80\x99s confidence, vows Colombia coach Jos\xc3\xa9 P\xc3\xa9kerman'


b'<p>The Colombia coach, Jos\xc3\xa9 P\xc3\xa9kerman, has vowed to restore Radamel Falcao\xe2\x80\x99s confidence during the South American country\xe2\x80\x99s mini-Asian tour next week.</p> <p>The Argentinian manager named the Manchester United striker in a 24-man squad for Colombia\xe2\x80\x99s upcoming games against Bahrain and Kuwait, before claiming he was desperate to meet the 29-year-old to help rejuvenate the player\xe2\x80\x99s career.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a huge problem that we need to resolve; this problem is as large as the sadness that Falcao is going through right now,\xe2\x80\x9d P\xc3\xa9kerman said. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel I need to support him because I understand how hard it is for him and the difficult moment he is experiencing. I want to work with him again and help him restore his confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In next week\xe2\x80\x99s international break Colombia will play their first games of 2015 in a double header in the Middle East, and P\xc3\xa9kerman has backed his struggling forward to use the opportunity to rediscover the form that made him one of the most feared goalscorers in the world.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI know Falcao\xe2\x80\x99s strengths, his mentality and his fighting spirit, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never doubted that he\xe2\x80\x99ll come out the other side,\xe2\x80\x9d P\xc3\xa9kerman said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s in a bad moment, but he\xe2\x80\x99s looking after himself and this week is going to be very important for him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Falcao\xe2\x80\x99s slump in form at Old Trafford has left many doubting where the on-loan striker\xe2\x80\x99s future lies, with Manchester United needing to decide whether to take up a \xc2\xa343.2m option to buy the Colombian at the end of the season. While that possibility currently seems extremely unlikely, back in Falcao\xe2\x80\x99s native Colombia many blame the Manchester United manager, Louis van Gaal, for the striker\xe2\x80\x99s form, particularly after Falcao was relegated to the Under-21 team for a recent match against Tottenham.</p> <p>But P\xc3\xa9kerman refused to criticise the Dutch coach for the humiliation, despite assuring that he is \xe2\x80\x9con Falcao\xe2\x80\x99s side\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWithout being there you can\xe2\x80\x99t really comment about these matters. In terms of decisions taken regarding coaching methods, players the manager chooses or in which team a player plays for, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I should comment on that.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, on a human level I\xe2\x80\x99m on Falcao\xe2\x80\x99s side because I know that he\xe2\x80\x99s suffering and he deserves the opportunity to work better and to have his chance to show that he\xe2\x80\x99s OK. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not my job to judge the decisions of another coach.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>P\xc3\xa9kerman, who led Colombia to a historic quarter-final finish at last year\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup, also named the Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina, Aston Villa\xe2\x80\x99s Carlos S\xc3\xa1nchez and the new Chelsea signing Juan Cuadrado in his latest squad.</p> <p>Standing in third place in the Fifa world rankings, Colombia face Bahrain next Thursday before travelling to Dubai to play Kuwait four days later as part of preparations for this summer\xe2\x80\x99s Copa America where Los Cafeteros will start as one of the favourites.</p>'
