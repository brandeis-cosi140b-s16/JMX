b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho says there is no racism in football over off-field jobs'


b'<p>Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s manager, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho, has rejected calls for the introduction of the Rooney Rule in English football, stating that managers should be appointed on merit and not because of the colour of their skin.</p> <p>The Professional Footballers\xe2\x80\x99 Association chief executive, Gordon Taylor, claims \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a hidden racism which holds clubs back\xe2\x80\x9d with the appointment of black and ethnic minority managers.</p> <p>Only two out of 92 clubs in English football\xe2\x80\x99s top four divisions employ a black manager after Chris Powell took charge of Huddersfield Town and Keith Curle joined Carlisle United last month and Taylor this week called for English football to adopt the Rooney Rule.</p> <p>The Rooney Rule is used in the NFL to ensure ethnic minority candidates are adequately represented in the interview process for head coaching positions.</p> <p>When asked if he felt football was doing enough to bring in black managers and whether he felt a quota should be introducced, Mourinho said: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no racism in football. If you are good, you are good. If you are good, you get the job.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are good, you prove that you deserve the job. Football is not stupid to close the doors to top people. If you are top, you are top.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Meanwhile the anti-racism group Kick It Out has called on football\xe2\x80\x99s governing bodies to take affirmative action to tackle the lack of diversity in the game.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cKick It Out was invited to 10 Downing Street by the Prime Minister for an anti-discrimination summit with football\xe2\x80\x99s leaders and a number of former players in February 2012,\xe2\x80\x9d it says.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cA clear pledge was made at this meeting to tackle the lack of diversity when it comes to positions off the field. What steps have we seen taken by those in power to address this under-representation following this?</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe implementation of the Rooney Rule has been talked about at different times since then in relation to management and coaching jobs and there does not appear to be any serious action or other initiative which may lead to an equitable outcome.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cGordon Taylor speaks about a \xe2\x80\x98hidden resistance\xe2\x80\x99 within the game and his members are asking questions about where football stands. We hear the Football League has failed to raise the issue at its own AGM but where are the Premier League and the Football Association on this matter?</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe current recruitment procedures are flawed and we need to see accountable processes put in place which are fair, objective and challengeable to provide everybody possessing the necessary coaching qualifications and experience with the opportunity to apply and be considered on merit.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs it stands, clubs as employers do not follow \xe2\x80\x98best practice\xe2\x80\x99 recruitment processes when they are hiring for these positions and it is clear that appointments are not made on the notion of merit.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cUntil football introduces best personnel management practices, especially in regards to recruitment and retention, they will continue to exclude many suitable and credible candidates who are not even given the opportunity to apply and be considered, and inevitably the outcomes are predictably unfair, exclusive and discriminatory.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
