b'Football transfer rumours: Robert Lewandowski to Manchester United?'


b'<p>With Radamel Falcao appearing to have spectacularly flunked his season-long audition for a permanent role at Manchester United, having scored just four goals in 14 starts for the club, the name of Robert Lewandowski is being touted as a possible replacement for the on-loan Colombian. Although he\xe2\x80\x99s scored 12 goals for Bayern Munich since his controversial move from Borussia Dortmund last summer, the Allianz Arena jury remains very much out on the 26-year-old Polish striker, who is believed to have a fan in Louis van Gaal and could be available for \xc2\xa330m. And whither Falcao? It seems the Bernab\xc3\xa9u beckons for the lank-haired Monaco frontman, whose training ground form appears to have now bottomed out to such an alarming extent that he remained an unused substitute throughout United\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 defeat at the hands of Swansea City over the weekend.</p> <p>Liverpool have been scouting Braga defensive midfielder Danilo, an 18-year-old they\xe2\x80\x99d like to bring to the Premier League from its Portuguese equivalent. Meanwhile at Porto, Danilo\xe2\x80\x99s compatriot and namesake ... er, Danilo could be the subject of a summer bidding war between Real Madrid, Barcelona, Manchester City and Manchester United. Currently trailing Benfica by seven points in the Primeira Liga, Porto are unlikely to fend off such high profile interest in the defender, who has a \xc2\xa336.9m buy-out clause in his contract.</p> <p>Palermo\xe2\x80\x99s Argentinian striker Paulo Dybala is another player to have attracted interest from some Premier League big hitters, with Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City and Arsenal all believed to be interested in securing the \xc2\xa330m-rated services of the 21-year-old with 12 goals to his name this season.</p> <p>Showing a stunning lack of imagination, Arsenal, Chelsea and United are also monitoring the progress of Anderlecht goalkeeper Mile Svilar, who at just 15 years of age has already been identified as the latest shot-stopping talent to roll off the Belgian assembly line.</p> <p>Despite being deemed surplus to requirements at Chelsea, Kevin de Bruyne has lit up the Bundesliga with some stellar performances for Wolfsburg this season and the whey-faced midfielder is now being linked with a return to the Premier League with Manchester City, who could send Edin Dzeko back to Lower Saxony from whence he came as part of a player-plus-cash deal.</p> <p>Sporting Lisbon youth team player Bubacar Djalo has got antennae twitching at Tottenham Hotspur, according to the Mirror. The 18-year-old defensive midfielder is also the subject of interest from Serie A side Roma and is believed to be out of contract and therefore available on the cheap. Wolves winger Bakary Sako isn\xe2\x80\x99t out of contract, but will be come season\xe2\x80\x99s end, when West Brom manager Tony Pulis hopes to bring him to the Hawthorns on a free. The Baggies attempted to secure the Malian international\xe2\x80\x99s scrawl with a bid of \xc2\xa32m on transfer deadline day, only for Wolves to turn down the cash and keep the player on board in order to help their push for a Championship play-off place.</p>'
