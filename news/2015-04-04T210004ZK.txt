b'Katie Chapman still ambitious as England face China before World Cup'


b'<p>Katie Chapman is preparing for her first England appearance on home soil since September 2010 at Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s new Academy stadium on Thursday, and the Chelsea captain and mother of three confesses to mixed emotions as she reflects on the time lost and the caps she missed out on winning during her four-year international exile.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been like: \xe2\x80\x98Where have those four years gone?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said the 32-year-old midfielder, who was left \xe2\x80\x9cangry and frustrated\xe2\x80\x9d after an impasse with the then England coach Hope Powell in March 2011. \xe2\x80\x9cI had a 10-minute conversation [with Powell], and then three hours later I got an email to say my [England] contract had been finished.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chapman\xe2\x80\x99s untimely England ejection had arisen on her return from playing in the professional American league for Chicago Red Stars and her desire to take time out from international football in order to settle her family back in England. \xe2\x80\x9cI needed that time for my children,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.</p> <p>A more sympathetic ear was found in Powell\xe2\x80\x99s successor Mark Sampson, who took charge in December 2013, and Chapman made her comeback at last month\xe2\x80\x99s Cyprus Cup when Sampson\xe2\x80\x99s team emerged triumphant with a 1-0 victory in the final against this year\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup hosts, Canada.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI found it easy to talk to Mark and Marieanne [Spacey, Sampson\xe2\x80\x99s assistant], about the situation,\xe2\x80\x9d said the 85-times capped former Millwall, Charlton and Arsenal player. \xe2\x80\x9cMarieanne\xe2\x80\x99s got a child as well, so she completely understands and it was refreshing that I was able to have those conversations and come to an agreement that I was happy with.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not been easy for me getting to this point, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve managed to combine being a mum with playing football as a career and it should be easier with the FA supporting me as well as the financial help I get with child care from Chelsea. Our head coach Emma Hayes is very understanding and knows just how hard it\xe2\x80\x99s been for me in the past.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Had Chapman remained in the England squad she would by now almost certainly be an international centurion, 45 games having been played between her departure and return. \xe2\x80\x9cI was angry and frustrated when I lost my central contract,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s been so long now that those feelings have sort of passed. I\xe2\x80\x99m still determined to get to 100 caps, though. That\xe2\x80\x99s a big ambition now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>When she steps out to face China on Thursday for what will be England\xe2\x80\x99s last outing before heading to Canada for the World Cup, which starts in June, Chapman will be aiming to stake a claim for a place in the squad and hoping that, with the FA\xe2\x80\x99s assistance, her three sons and husband, Mark, will be able to spend some time with her during the tournament.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how that situation would be resolved in terms of taking Harvey (11) and Riley (6) out of school in term time, but \xe2\x80\x93 if selected of course \xe2\x80\x93 we\xe2\x80\x99ll work on that,\xe2\x80\x9d Chapman said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Zachary\xe2\x80\x99s second birthday on 13 June and I\xe2\x80\x99d hate to miss that, but I would talk to Mark and Marieanne and take it from there.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI definitely want to be in the World Cup squad. From the day I left the England set-up four years ago I always wanted to come back when the time was right, and I feel that I\xe2\x80\x99ve fitted well into Mark\xe2\x80\x99s squad.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was an amazing feeling to put the England shirt on again when I made my comeback at the Cyprus Cup, and it will be great to be involved against China. I always loved playing in front of our home fans and I think that Thursday, in an exciting new stadium, can be a fantastic World Cup send-off for the team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
