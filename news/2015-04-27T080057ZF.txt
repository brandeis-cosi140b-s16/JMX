b'Football transfer rumours: Giannelli Imbula to Chelsea?'


b'<p>Tough-tackling Marseille ball-winner Giannelli Imbula has long been a Chelsea, Arsenal and Juventus target and looks likely to leave the Ligue 1 side for pastures new during the summer. A box-to-box midfielder who has drawn comparisons with Patrick Vieira and Claude Mak\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9, the 22-year-old French U-21 international has flourished in the Marseille first team under Marcelo Bielsa and reports today suggest Chelsea are pondering a \xc2\xa320m bid for a player who is eligible to play his senior international football for Belgium, France and DR Congo.</p> <p>The Premier League champions-elect are also reported to be interested in Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s French midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin, a state of affairs that ought to signal that the Stamford Bridge jig is well and truly up for John Obi Mikel, who could be heading for a surprise reunion with his former manager Carlo Ancelotti at Real Madrid, according to one Italian sports news website.</p> <p>Another player who could be heading for the Marseille exit door is Florian Thauvin, who is 22 years old and primarily a left winger, but capable of doing a job all across midfield. Quick, energetic, strong on either foot and with a keen eye for goal, the youngster has got antennae twitching at Tottenham Hotspur, who the Mirror report could make a bid in the summer.</p> <p>Monaco\xe2\x80\x99s defensive midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia could also find himself joining the mass exodus from France, as he is one of several defensive midfielders to have caught the eye of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger. Capable of playing in central defence and at left-back, he could be just the kind of versatile utility man Arsenal fans have been heard crying out for at times in the past season and could prove a snip at \xc2\xa311m. As has been reported in this column previously, Lyon\xe2\x80\x99s attacking midfielder Nabil Fekir is also on Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s shopping list.  </p> <p>Despite last week\xe2\x80\x99s talk that Manchester United were this close to signing Borussia Dortmund midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, for \xc2\xa321.5m, the German club\xe2\x80\x99s sporting director Michael Zorc has poured a giant bucket of ice-cold water over speculation that a deal has all but been agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no signature, no contract, no offer, no request and not even a contact,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, rather emphatically. \xe2\x80\x9cThe last time I talked to Manchester United was in November 2014 and that was about a different topic,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, failing to elaborate on what exactly that topic might have been. Gundogan is likely to be in popular demand this summer, with the Star reporting that representatives from Manchester City and Arsenal are likely to gyrate lasciviously before the player in the hope of capturing his attention.</p> <p>Once they\xe2\x80\x99ve recovered from the shell-shock of that shellacking at the hands of Everton, Manchester United will step up their attempts to sign Gareth Bale from Real Madrid, try to prise goalkeeper Hugo Lloris away from Tottenham Hotspur as cover for the potentially Bernab\xc3\xa9u-bound David De Gea and sell currently on-loan-at-Real Madrid striker Javier Hern\xc3\xa1ndez  to Southampton. Saints are also keen on keeping QPR winger Matt Phillips in the Premier League should his current side drop a division, but will face competition from West Brom in the summer scramble to retain the 24-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s services.</p> <p>Speculation in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s papers suggested Liverpool are planning a complete overhaul of their famous transfer committee, while speculation in today\xe2\x80\x99s suggests Brendan Rodgers is plotting a summer trolley dash that will end with him scanning PSV Eindhoven winger Memphis Depay, Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke and his Burnley counterpart Danny Ings before placing them in the bagging area. Depay\xe2\x80\x99s name had been mentioned in conjunction with a \xc2\xa325m move to Manchester United following reports he and his agent Kees Ploegsma met Louis van Gaal and other representatives of the club on Wednesday, but the 21-year-old has since flatly denied any such pow-wow took place. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely no truth in that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to Manchester United.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Sam Allardyce is expected to leave West Ham once his contract expires come season\xe2\x80\x99s end and has been linked with a move Stateside to take over any MLS team that\xe2\x80\x99ll have him and with a move to Wearside to replace interim Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is only one thing that needs to be sorted out here and that is me sitting down with the owners when they are ready to talk about me being at West Ham and nowhere else,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam of his current gig. \xe2\x80\x9cUntil that is resolved we won\xe2\x80\x99t know which way we are both going forward. That is the only thing that is to be sorted, to sit down and sort it out.\xe2\x80\x9d Having secured promotion to the Premier League with Watford over the weekend after just six months in English football, the club\xe2\x80\x99s Serbian manager Slavisa Jokanovic is also being linked with the Sunderland job.</p>'
