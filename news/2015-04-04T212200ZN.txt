b'Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s John Carver faces up to Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s Lee Cattermole'


b'<p>Lee Cattermole could be found consorting with the enemy last weekend but no one should doubt the midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s determination to keep Sunderland in the Premier League. When John Carver not only found himself staying at the same luxury Scottish golf resort as Cattermole but occupying an adjacent lodge, Newcastle United\xe2\x80\x99s head coach was confronted by arguably the biggest stumbling block to his hopes of winning Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s Wear-Tyne derby at the Stadium of Light.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf Lee\xe2\x80\x99s getting on the ball and dictating things, then it will be a problem for us,\xe2\x80\x9d says Carver, who is desperate to end Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s sequence of four straight derby wins but fears Dick Advocaat\xe2\x80\x99s replacement of Gus Poyet last month may toughen Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s task. \xe2\x80\x9cLee\xe2\x80\x99s clash with Moussa Sissoko will be massive, it will be a key head-to-head battle,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Moussa\xe2\x80\x99s getting on the ball and dominating Lee then it will be big\xc2\xa0for us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Cattermole\xe2\x80\x99s recent absence, due to a combination of injury and suspension, partly explains why Sunderland have won only one of their previous 13 Premier League games and scored just once in the last six matches. Should he help undo Newcastle, the man Advocaat has dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cour controller\xe2\x80\x9d will confirm the impression that he is the only Sunderland player rival clubs are likely to be queuing up to purchase this summer. As befits his Tyneside roots, Carver has little love for Sunderland \xe2\x80\x93 but plenty of time for their outstanding individual. \xe2\x80\x9cI get on quite well with Lee, believe it or not,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI had a little chat with him when I saw him last weekend. It was the international break and we were up at Archerfield. Myself and Steve Stone [Carver\xe2\x80\x99s assistant] were up there with some friends and he was with some of his friends in the lodge opposite so we had a chat.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Carver pointed out that Cattermole received his 10th yellow card of the season against Hull, meaning that his two-game suspension was served before the derby. Carver said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat shows how much the derby means to him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ellis Short, Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s owner, can only hope Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s match is similarly important to some of his other, rather more expensively assembled players as he perhaps wonders how on earth it has come to this. On paper his club should be comfortably mid-table. Few rivals can match the magnificently appointed near 50,000-capacity Stadium of Light, let alone boast crowds which have averaged almost 43,000 this season.</p> <p>Off the pitch so much feels right about Sunderland. There is the bold overseas marketing strategy focusing largely on combining merchandising initiatives with laudable, and pioneering, community work in Africa. Closer to home, club executives are pressing ahead with plans to build the \xe2\x80\x9cBeacon of Light\xe2\x80\x9d, a charitable sporting and educational facility for disadvantaged young people on Wearside.</p> <p>In a world still dominated by middle-aged men in grey suits, the chief executive, Margaret Byrne, is a bright young lawyer. She works alongside Lee Congerton, the sporting director and a much coveted recruitment specialist equipped with an enviable contacts book.</p> <p>So far, so promising but there is a significant disconnect. Despite the plethora of encouraging indicators, not to mention Short\xe2\x80\x99s genuine familiarity with Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s history and apparently inexhaustible enthusiasm for attempting to get things right, the core product \xe2\x80\x93 the team \xe2\x80\x93 remains startlingly sub-standard.</p> <p>Perhaps the most damning indictment is that no academy player has broken into the first XI since Jordan Henderson and Jack Colback. While Henderson is now at Liverpool, Colback will be one of the first names on Carver\xe2\x80\x99s team-sheet.</p> <p>If there are definite signs that, a year into the job, Congerton, a former Chelsea chief scout and Hamburg technical director, is starting to put things right, the fear is that past mistakes may have to be corrected in the Championship.</p> <p>The hope of avoiding that doomsday scenario prompted Advocaat\xe2\x80\x99s installation, making the much-travelled former Holland coach the fourth manager in two years at a club whose latest accounts reveal a \xc2\xa317m loss. Even worse, a \xc2\xa3144m investment in a bewildering array of players since 2007 and the creation of a wage bill higher than Everton\xe2\x80\x99s has merely prompted a series of relegation battles. Small wonder Short, a billionaire financier who has pumped around \xc2\xa3130m into Sunderland since assuming full control in 2009, is anxious not to miss out on the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s gargantuan new television deal .</p> <p>If a combination of parachute payments and the 40% wage reduction clauses understood to be written into most player contracts in the event of relegation might soften the blow of Championship football, Sunderland could still expect to find themselves worse off by around \xc2\xa350m a year.</p> <p>This, alarmingly real, prospect is a direct consequence of bad managerial appointments allied to poor signings. Adam Johnson (currently on police bail following allegations of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl), Jack Rodwell, Steven Fletcher and Connor Wickham cost a collective \xc2\xa340m but have produced relatively little in return. Meanwhile Congerton\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor, the former agent Roberto De Fanti has much to answer for.</p> <p>Advocaat\xe2\x80\x99s challenge is to make the best of a bad job. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to improve and the players know that,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to realise there\xe2\x80\x99s not too much\xc2\xa0time.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
