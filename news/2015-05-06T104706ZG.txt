b'Gareth Bale determined to stay with Real Madrid in the long term'


b'<p>Gareth Bale has no desire to leave Real Madrid and is confident the Spanish club view him as an integral part of their long-term future, making any hope Manchester United or Chelsea have of signing the forward this summer appear remote.</p> <p>Bale\xe2\x80\x99s performances at Real have been questioned this season \xe2\x80\x93 he was heavily criticised for his display in Juventus\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 win on Tuesday night \xe2\x80\x93 and he has become the focal point for the supporters\xe2\x80\x99 ire on occasions. After a 2-1 defeat at Barcelona  in March, Bale\xe2\x80\x99s car was attacked by fans at Real\xe2\x80\x99s training ground. AS, the Spanish newspaper that leans toward Real, did not offer a mark on Bale for his display in that match.</p>  <p> Related: Gareth Bale and the Real Madrid blame game goes on after Juventus no-show | David Hytner </p>   <p>In January Real fans jeered him for failing to pass to Cristiano Ronaldo in a 3-0 victory over Espanyol, a game in which he also scored; Carlo Ancelotti refused to criticise him afterwards.</p> <p>Bale has scored 13 times in 28 La Liga starts and Real trail Bar\xc3\xa7a in the title race by only two points. If Real can overturn Juventus\xe2\x80\x99s advantage in next Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s second leg of their Champions League semi-final then on 6 June in Berlin they could become the first club to retain the European Cup since the competition\xe2\x80\x99s format changed from a straight home-and-away knockout basis.</p> <p>Manchester United attempted to buy Bale two years ago when he opted to join Real and are again interested in the Welshman, whose price would be more than the world record \xc2\xa386m paid to Tottenham Hotspur. Chelsea also retain an interest, as do a host of other top European clubs, in a player who has four seasons left of the six-year deal he signed at the Bernab\xc3\xa9u.</p> <p>However, Bale continues to be happy at Real, viewing the 10-times European Cup winners as the biggest club in the world, and he has assurances that the hierarchy believe he is vital to their continuing success. In April last year Bale scored the winner in the Copa del Rey final against Barcelona and he then finished his first season with Real by putting them 2-1 ahead in extra time of the following month\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League final against Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid, which Ancelotti\xe2\x80\x99s team won 4-1.</p> <p>At the end of March Florentino P\xc3\xa9rez, the Real president, voiced his content with Bale. \xe2\x80\x9cWe would never listen to any offers for Bale no matter what the bid was,\xe2\x80\x9dhe said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a unique player who has already given so much to the team. He is the key to the club\xe2\x80\x99s future, just like I cannot imagine a future without Cristiano Ronaldo.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>United would seem to have more robust funds to pursue Bale than Chelsea. Should Louis van Gaal request it, then Ed Woodward would certainly explore any possibility of landing the 25-year-old and United\xe2\x80\x99s executive vice-chairman is aware of the particular political machinations at work at Real.</p> <p>As United\xe2\x80\x99s world record \xc2\xa3750m kit deal over 10 years with Adidas starts this summer Van Gaal has ample funds to pay the valuation of around \xc2\xa3100m Bale would cost should he be available. However, the Welshman has told friends that he sees himself at Real for many years and feels there is a reciprocal sentiment from the club.</p>     Real Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s Gareth Bale, left, is tackled by Juventus\xe2\x80\x99 Leonardo Bonucci during the Champions League game in Turin on Tuesday. Photograph: Luca Bruno/AP    <p>United face a sizeable challenge in this summer\xe2\x80\x99s window if Van Gaal is to strengthen his squad in the areas he considers are required to make them credible challengers again next season. The club are confident of signing the PSV Eindhoven winger Memphis Depay, while the Borussia Dortmund central defender Mats Hummels, like the right-backs S\xc3\xa9amus Coleman of Everton and Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s Nathaniel Clyne, remains a target. However, David de Gea is yet to sign fresh terms and Van Gaal admitted recently that he does not know if the Spaniard will do so as the decision rests firmly with the goalkeeper.</p> <p>The 24-year-old, the sole United player to be among the nominees for the Professional Footballers\xe2\x80\x99 Association\xe2\x80\x99s Player of the Year, has been among the club\xe2\x80\x99s finest performers this term and if he were to depart this would be a further headache for Van Gaal. V\xc3\xadctor Vald\xc3\xa9s, the No2, is yet to make his debut and so the 33-year-old former Barcelona goalkeeper is unproven as a potential replacement for his younger compatriot.</p>'
