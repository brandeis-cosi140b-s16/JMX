b'Joe Hart says Manchester City can win remaining Champions League games'


b'<p>Joe Hart is insistent Manchester City can win the remaining five matches of a Champions League group that also includes Roma and CSKA Moscow.</p> <p>Hart, who was among City\xe2\x80\x99s best players at the Allianz Arena, said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe can match Bayern Munich, we have some very tough games now and we have to play well against CSKA and Roma. We\xe2\x80\x99re confident we can win the rest of our games. We fought hard all night against a good team \xe2\x80\x93 you know what you get when you come.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cA nasty deflection at the end has done us and J\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xb4me Boateng comes back to haunt us. It would have been a well-deserved draw. We made good chances, good blocks and we made them work hard for everything.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>With Roma the next opposition, at the Etihad Stadium at the end of the month, the matches against the Italian club may decide whether City progress. In reaction to Roma\xe2\x80\x99s 5-1 trouncing of CSKA, Hart said: \xe2\x80\x9cRoma won 5-1? Wow.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Looking ahead to Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s visit on Sunday, Hart said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get any easier for us but that\xe2\x80\x99s the beauty of playing for this side \xe2\x80\x93 you get big game after big game. We like to think of ourselves as big-game players, so we need to step up again on Sunday. It\xe2\x80\x99s a big week for us [after drawing 2-2 at Arsenal]. We\xe2\x80\x99ve not won for a little while, so we need to step up.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to win. It\xe2\x80\x99s a close Premier League, they are a title rival and we need to beat them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Manuel Pellegrini decided to drop Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero in order to save the striker for Chelsea. Rub\xc3\xa9n Cousillas, the assistant who stood in for the manager because of a Uefa ban, defended Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s move.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe know that Kun Ag\xc3\xbcero has high importance but [Edin] Dzeko has as well,\xe2\x80\x9d Cousillas said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re both very strong. We have to play against Chelsea next and Manuel said: \xe2\x80\x98We had to rotate, everyone is going to get chance to play.\xe2\x80\x99 All these opponents are so strong. We want the team to work and function.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of the late defeat Cousillas said: \xe2\x80\x9cDefinitely we are frustrated. We made a really good game and also good entertainment for the people \xe2\x80\x93 we had two teams that tried to make goals. To concede in last minute was frustrating.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He reiterated Hart\xe2\x80\x99s view that City can still win Group E. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s the first game, we have only just begun, but there are many games ahead and we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be too sad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe still can become first in the group. Naturally, of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s not good to start with a defeat, but there are five games ahead so it means it depends on us, the team is really strong at home. It\xe2\x80\x99s a really difficult group but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure we are going to make it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Despite a disappointing display from Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9, Cousillas confirmed the midfielder was not carrying an injury. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was absolutely fit and physically without problem,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>Regarding City\xe2\x80\x99s late claim for a penalty when David Silva went down, Cousillas said: \xe2\x80\x9cFrom my position I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see that really well. Some people said it could have been a penalty but this is a decision for referee and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to comment on that. You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen what the result is and we can\xe2\x80\x99t complain about that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
