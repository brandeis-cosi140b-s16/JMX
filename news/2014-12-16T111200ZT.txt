b'The forgotten story of \xe2\x80\xa6 Frank Barson\xe2\x80\x99s seven-month ban'


b'<p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was brought up to play hard and saw nothing wrong with an honest-to-goodness shoulder charge,\xe2\x80\x9d Frank Barson once said, emphatically playing things down. In fact he was brought up to be a blacksmith and, hardened by all that exposure to fire and molten metal, grew into one of the meanest and toughest defenders in the history of the English game. When Barson lined up against them an honest-to-goodness shoulder charge was the very least of his opponents\xe2\x80\x99 worries.</p> <p>Born in Sheffield, Barson\xe2\x80\x99s professional career started at Barnsley where, in a game against Grimsby in February 1914, he accidentally (or that\xe2\x80\x99s what it said in the local newspaper) collided with the referee, a Mr Bamlett of Gateshead, knocking him unconscious. He continued to give match officials \xe2\x80\x93 and, indeed, his own clubs \xe2\x80\x93 no end of headaches thereafter.</p> <p>In so doing he made very few friends at the Football Association, then a straight-laced organisation that took unkindly to casual violence on the field of play. He was to become the first player to be charged retrospectively for misconduct \xe2\x80\x93 after a trademark challenge (they used to call it \xe2\x80\x9cThe Barson Barge\xe2\x80\x9d) on Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Sam Cowan in the 1926 FA Cup semi-final \xe2\x80\x93 and have his career effectively ended when a sending-off led to an unusually harsh seven-month ban.</p> <p>Barson joined Aston Villa in 1919 for \xc2\xa32,850 after falling out with Barnsley over travel expenses. He stayed for three years, becoming increasingly unpopular with the Villa hierarchy, principally because of his refusal to move to Birmingham from his home in Grimesthorpe, on the outskirts of Sheffield. He had business interests there and a circle of close friends that included Lawrence and William Fowler, notorious leaders of the city\xe2\x80\x99s then thriving gang culture (on the day Sheffield United beat Cardiff in the 1925 FA Cup final the Fowlers got into an argument over a barmaid with a chap called William Plommer and ended up killing him, an offence for which both were hanged. They traded letters with Barson from prison while they awaited their fates).</p> <p>In 1920 he won the FA Cup with Villa, who beat Huddersfield 1-0 at Stamford Bridge, a game in which he earned the unlikely distinction of receiving a warning as to his conduct by the referee, Jack Howcroft, before it had even kicked off. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first wrong move you make, Barson, off you go,\xe2\x80\x9d Howcroft said. There would be no wrong moves.</p>     Frank Barson (bottom row, second left) with the Aston Villa team, directors and trainers after their victory in the 1920 FA Cup final. Photograph: Colorsport/REX    <p>Even that trophy did not improve his standing in the Villa boardroom and, when he missed the first game of the following season after mistiming his commute, they suspended him for a fortnight and gave him a month to move to Birmingham. He refused. (The irony here is that after his playing career ended he did indeed move to Birmingham and at the time of his death was living a short walk from Villa Park). Villa suspended him again in March 1922, for inviting a friend into the dressing room at Liverpool and refusing to apologise for it.</p> <p>He was good enough, though, to be worth a bit of hassle. The book Aston Villa: A Complete Record (not to be confused with the book Aston Villa: The Complete Record, which is an entirely different tome by different authors published 22 years later) says that \xe2\x80\x9cdespite several brushes with authority, Barson was a truly great centre-half, a fierce tackler and dominant in the air \xe2\x80\xa6 he revitalised a flagging Villa team. His dynamic personality brought the best out of the players.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He was made captain and scored a celebrated 30-yard header against Sheffield United. He was particularly skilful with his head and once, in a match against Tottenham, dribbled the ball from one end to the other without once using his feet. It was estimated that he headed the ball 86 times during the run, which ended within yards of the Spurs goal.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere isn\xe2\x80\x99t a centre-half anywhere in the land who can break up an attack so skilfully; who can pull a high ball to the carpet and keep it there; who can nod a ball down to a colleague\xe2\x80\x99s toe with his head; who can shoot with such amazing force and accuracy; or who can do such foolish little tricks in the temper-displaying line as this player,\xe2\x80\x9d read one profile, written by someone bylined enigmatically as \xe2\x80\x9can outside right\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the rub. Frank isn\xe2\x80\x99t in good favour with the high authorities simply because his name is for ever associated with rough play, yet you can take my word for it that he is never a man to go out of his way deliberately to crock a player. Give Frank a rough and tumble and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be delighted, for the simple reason that a trial of real strength is to him a breath of ozone. It is a tonic, just as a fight is to an Irishman or an argument to a Scot.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>After that incident on Merseyside Barson submitted a transfer request, and in the summer of 1922 he joined Manchester United, then in the Second Division, for \xc2\xa35,000. He was immediately named captain and, despite a string of injuries, became enormously popular \xe2\x80\x93 though, as the Times once aptly put it, he was \xe2\x80\x9cnot loved by any but members of his own crowd\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOpponents have got so tired of his never-ceasing wrong-doing that there is a movement afoot to send a petition to the authorities in order to prevent the player from crocking others,\xe2\x80\x9d one paper reported, early in 1925. That campaign, apparently organised by the Chelsea squad, came to nought and at the end of that season United finished runners-up to Leicester in the Second Division (10 points and three places ahead of Chelsea) to earn promotion to the top flight.</p>     Frank Barson (back row, far left) with his Manchester United teammates and their trainer during the 1922-23 season. Photograph: Colorsport/REX    <p>Barson had a unique reason to celebrate that achievement. According to the terms of his contract with United, if the club were to secure promotion in any of the three seasons after his arrival, they would immediately and without delay give him a pub. So at the end of the 1924-25 season Barson was handed the keys to the George &amp; Dragon in Ardwick. On his opening night the bar was so busy, with many fans seeking the attention of Barson himself, that within an hour he told the barman he could keep the place and fled, never to return.</p> <p>There were other bonuses. \xe2\x80\x9cJack Smith, a much underrated player before the last war, told me the story of how, when Barson walked into the United dressing room, he would put a hand on to a shelf in search of a package before he took his coat off,\xe2\x80\x9d the long-time Manchester City scout Harry Godwin once said. \xe2\x80\x9cOne day there was no package and he said to the trainer, \xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s the doins? I\xe2\x80\x99m not taking my bloody coat off til I get it!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Again he was worth the hassle. After United beat Sunderland to reach the 1926 FA Cup quarter-finals, the Guardian crowed that he had been \xe2\x80\x9ca commanding figure\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cHe held the side together at a critical time and set an example of bold tackling, well-judged passing and not a little daring that was of incalculable value,\xe2\x80\x9d we wrote.</p> <p>But eventually age and injury slowed him down. Towards the start of the 1927-28 season he suffered a spine injury, which kept him out for several months and after finally returning to fitness he broke his nose in his first game back. At its end United made him available on a free transfer, which despite the injuries was considered by the Dundee Evening Telegraph \xe2\x80\x9cone of the greatest surprises of the football season in England\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Barson is now recovered from his troubles there will be many clubs only too ready to sign him,\xe2\x80\x9d they wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cFrank has always been a much criticised player but no one can doubt his great ability. He is credited by those competent to judge with being the best centre-half since the war.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     The Guardian once praised Frank Barson\xe2\x80\x99s combination of \xe2\x80\x9cbold tackling, well-judged passing, and not a little daring\xe2\x80\x9d. Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images    <p>Perhaps he had not fully recovered from his troubles because, when the move came, it was to Third Division Watford, who that summer also signed his United team-mates Billy Chapman and Tommy Barnett. The latter went on to score 163 times for the club in league and cup, a tally bettered in its history only by Luther Blissett, but Barson\xe2\x80\x99s time at Vicarage Road was to be briefer and much less glorious.</p> <p>A few games into it, in September 1928, during a 6-2 home defeat against Fulham, he was adjudged to have kicked Jimmy Temple and was sent off. He refused, arguing his case with the referee for a while before reluctantly trudging from the field.</p> <p>Barson may well have become famous for a predilection for menace and violence but his disciplinary record had always been considerably better than his reputation. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt I had a bad game if I was not booed but I never punched or butted anybody,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in 1965. \xe2\x80\x9cPlayers today are stupid. Cruder. They do things openly and ask to be sent off. We did it without being seen half the time.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>When he did enrage a referee it was most frequently because of things he had said rather than what he had done. \xe2\x80\x9cThough one of the greatest half-backs in football, Barson has a reputation for impulsiveness and does not always keep a guard upon his tongue,\xe2\x80\x9d the Yorkshire Evening Post once wrote, summing the situation up rather nicely.</p> <p>Now, it was as if the FA had bottled up a career\xe2\x80\x99s worth of enmity and finally got an excuse to pull the cork. They had picked on him a little bit before: in the 1926 FA Cup semi-final the referee had deemed his shoulder charge on Cowan worthy of no more than a free-kick but a couple of watching FA councillors started disciplinary proceedings against him anyway, a move without precedent in English football, and then banned him for two months.</p> <p>Those same FA councillors had full control over England team selection and, despite his reliable excellence, Barson\xe2\x80\x99s international career stalled after a single cap, against Wales at Highbury in 1920 (it was England\xe2\x80\x99s first defeat by the Welsh since 1882; Billy Meredith was Wales\xe2\x80\x99 inspiration, playing at outside-right at the age of 44).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFor years Barson was without question England\xe2\x80\x99s best pivot, yet the selectors consistently passed him over,\xe2\x80\x9d reported the Daily Worker in 1930. \xe2\x80\x9cBoss sport being what it is, it was more than a rumour that it was not only his vigorous play that kept Barson from a heap of caps: that someone behind the scenes in the Football Association had blackballed him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>At the time of his offence against Fulham, the FA was developing a taste for lengthy bans. A year previously South Shields\xe2\x80\x99 Cyril Hunter, in a Second Division match against Middlesbrough, had put in a display of such consistent brutality that by the end, according to the local paper, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Middlesbrough dressing room was like a field ambulance station\xe2\x80\x9d. He was banned until the end of the following season, still a British record.</p> <p>Barson\xe2\x80\x99s offence had been much less clearcut. Indeed, many observers thought it unworthy of even a sending-off. Nevertheless, the FA suspended him for seven months, which effectively \xe2\x80\x93 given that it took him to the end of the season \xe2\x80\x93 meant he could not play again for nearly a year.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe most I ever dreamed of was a month\xe2\x80\x99s suspension,\xe2\x80\x9d the player said at the time. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a wife and three children and am faced with the prospect of seven months without a livelihood.\xe2\x80\x9d Barson insisted that Temple was to blame, having grabbed him by the leg and refused to let go. \xe2\x80\x9cIn trying to free myself the referee apparently thought I was trying to kick Temple,\xe2\x80\x9d he claimed.</p> <p>Barson\xe2\x80\x99s suspension caused considerable controversy in Watford, with the club\xe2\x80\x99s chairman, John Kilby, labelling it \xe2\x80\x9cmost unjust\xe2\x80\x9d and the manager, Fred Pagnam, insisting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe club are absolutely astounded at the sentence and so are the club\xe2\x80\x99s supporters in the town\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Watford\xe2\x80\x99s fans were so astounded that they organised a petition demanding the ban be reconsidered and, after 4,850 people signed it, the mayor, Alderman T Rushton, took it to the headquarters of the Football Association. \xe2\x80\x9cI have not signed the petition myself but I support it and agree with it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Rushton, who had been at the Fulham game, before he set off for London. \xe2\x80\x9cMy view is that Temple caught hold of Barson\xe2\x80\x99s leg and, as far as I could see, Barson was endeavouring to get his leg released when the referee caused the stoppage and ordered him off the field. I did not see Barson kick Temple. The spectators were shouting a good deal and the players were rather rough, perhaps on that account. Fulham are rather keen \xe2\x80\x93 too keen, I think \xe2\x80\x93 in trying to regain a position in the Second Division.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>And this is where the tale becomes more extraordinary still for, though Rushton took the petition to the FA, nobody ever read it or even officially received it because, once the mayor had been told about all the nasty stuff the FA had in the player\xe2\x80\x99s file, he asked them to burn it.</p> <p>Frederick Wall, the FA secretary, later explained what transpired. \xe2\x80\x9cOn arriving at the FA offices the mayor stated he had come to present a petition on behalf of Barson and asked if he might read it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI asked whether the mayor had read the referee\xe2\x80\x99s report with reference to Barson. He said he had not, so I showed him the original report. I asked, \xe2\x80\x98Do you know anything of Barson\xe2\x80\x99s history as a football player?\xe2\x80\x99 The mayor replied he did not. So I read to him information showing that we, the FA, had had to consider numerous reports of Barson\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct on the field, that he had been suspended on three previous occasions, once for one month and twice for two months. The Mayor asked me to destroy the petition. I destroyed it with his knowledge and in his presence. It was burned in his presence.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>According to the referee, Barson had deliberately kicked Temple and, having been sent off, refused to leave the field for some minutes and then threatened the referee before doing so. Some form of punishment for this seemed inevitable but the severity of his punishment and the justification for it appear puzzling.</p> <p>Wall referred to three previous suspensions. The one-month ban followed a sending-off in the first round of the 1914-15 FA Cup, 14 years earlier. It may seem lengthy but Barson was one of four players to get such a punishment that weekend alone. Of the two-month bans, one apparently followed a brawl in a pre-season friendly against Birmingham City in 1911 and the other followed that 1926 semi-final and anyway covered the entirely irrelevant period from 3 May, two days after United\xe2\x80\x99s last game of the season, until the start of July. Clearly Barson was no angel, but his heinous disciplinary record essentially amounted to one fabricated suspension in 14 years.</p> <p>The Watford supporters\xe2\x80\x99 club launched a new petition, this time collecting more than 15,000 signatures, but still the FA was unmoved. \xe2\x80\x9cThe signatories of the petition cannot know the facts of the case,\xe2\x80\x9d they sniffed. \xe2\x80\x9cWe therefore must decline to reopen the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d Barson served his suspension, never playing for Watford again (instead he managed the King William IV pub on Watford High Street for a while), before joining Hartlepool and then Wigan Borough, who found his wages such a stretch that they went out of business 18 months later.</p> <p>Perhaps it could be argued that Barson\xe2\x80\x99s ban was not long enough: his last ever appearance in the Football League came on Boxing Day 1930, by which time he was 40, and he ended on a suitably brutal note. In the 83rd minute of a match against Accrington Stanley he jumped on an opponent and then swore at the referee after he was sent off. The disciplinary commission that adjudicated the matter reported that they were \xe2\x80\x9csatisfied the conduct of both teams in the match did not reflect any credit on the players concerned\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Barson went into coaching, including spells with Villa\xe2\x80\x99s juniors and seniors and a short period there as caretaker manager, and died at the age of 77 in 1968. \xe2\x80\x9cA strong, commanding and forceful centre-half, his vigorous play so incensed the crowds that the moment he stepped on the pitch he was greeted with cries of \xe2\x80\x98Dirty Barson!\xe2\x80\x99 wrote the Guardian in a short obituary. \xe2\x80\x9cYet it might have been a case of giving a dog a bad name. Apart from the strength of his play he had few equals \xe2\x80\x93 and there are certainly none today \xe2\x80\x93 in the matter of heading the ball. To see Barson stand in the centre of the field and direct a full-blooded clearance with his head to either wing was a sight indeed.\xe2\x80\x9d It was just a pity that nobody at the Football Association appreciated it.</p> <p>As it happened, three months after Villa signed Barson in October 1919 they brought in another, younger centre-back who was to become just as memorable. If Barson was notorious for his violence on the pitch, however, the man who eventually took his place in the first XI, Tommy Ball, was to be remembered for his violent end off it. But that is another story.</p> <p>The forgotten story of Tommy Ball will be published on Wednesday.</p>'
