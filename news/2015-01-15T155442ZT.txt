b'The Fiver | A team that needs a big, fat, injection of celebrity appeal'


b'<p>HUNGRY FOR MORE?</p> <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s been a while since we heard of a big-boned, oft-knee-knacked brilliant Brazilian with an appetite for saturated fat and high-farce in the bedroom, but last night The Ronaldo waddled his way to a press conference at USA! USA!! USA!!! NASL soccerballers The Fort Lauderdale Strikers with something to say. As assorted hacks gobbled their way through the buffet cart, having heard who would be in attendance, the specialist in fluid retention had some potentially big news for them. Yes, he would be making a comeback to the world of weight-loss.</p> <p>You see it\xe2\x80\x99s been two years since Ronaldo last tackled the fatty acid in his system by appearing on Globo\xe2\x80\x99s Medida Certa (The Right Measure), a Brazilian version of Celebrity Fit Club that helped the two-time Ballon D\xe2\x80\x99Or winner shed enough so he could stand comfortably next to a man in a padded suit without the general public wondering which one was the club mascot. But now the 38-year-old says he will use the possibility of a return to professional football with the club he part-owns as a motivator to get back in shape.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI love to play, I love soccer, that was all my life my big love. When I retired, I stopped playing because of my body, so much pain and injuries,\xe2\x80\x9d sniffed Ronaldo, who when he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t scoring goals, was usually being prodded by club doctors in a career with more ups and downs than the The Big One. \xe2\x80\x9cTo play a soccer game you have to be in very good shape. I will try for myself, it\xe2\x80\x99s another challenge, I am sure it will help the league, help the team. I will train a lot, and if the [coach] needs me, maybe,\xe2\x80\x9d he wheezed, as Hot Shot the mascot stepped to one side in order that he could be seen.</p> <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting diet plan and one that The Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s American cousin, Chad-Fat-Camp Fiver, will watch with interest over the coming months. But we can\xe2\x80\x99t help but think that, having studied advertising for the past two years, Ronaldo is perhaps using the weighty knowledge of his own standing to flog a few extra season-tickets for a team that needs a big, fat, injection of celebrity appeal if it is to punch its weight in a league that most people think is for racing stock cars. Either that, or his Belly Burner Belt is properly knacked.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Gregg Bakowski from 7pm GMT for MBM coverage of Real Madrid 3-0 Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid (agg: 3-2) in the Copa del Rey. Sounds dramatic. Better log on.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe club received the evidence from [Big Website], launched an immediate investigation into the matter and has terminated our association with Mr Aakjaer. Manchester United is an inclusive organisation and will not tolerate this sort of behaviour\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Old Trafford suits hastily remove European scout Torben Aakjaer from their payroll over a series of anti-immigration slurs posted on his FaceSpace account.</p>      FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPlease can I recommend The Fiver steers clear of any future Prometheus analogies (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver). Referring to an individual who ended up being tortured every day, by the same punishing method, at exactly the same time(ish), with monotonous regularity \xe2\x80\xa6 might just resonate too much with your reader. Sorry\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Angus Golding.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI can endorse Mr Karamfiles\xe2\x80\x99 experience regarding the Manchester Ship Canal Company (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters), having had my budget surgically removed by the aforementioned for the pleasure of disposing of dredged material from the canal to facilitate taking heavy cargo off our busy roads. However, this is the nature of capitalism and in particular the consequence of a private company owning a valuable monopoly resource. By way of contrast, Radamel Falcao finds himself in a competitive, non-monopolistic situation as one of a number of slow, perennially crocked 28-year-old strikers. So, it may be more beneficial to Mr Falcao\xe2\x80\x99s pension pot if he ignores the attractions of the good ship Do One and instead asks his agent to convey him in time-honoured fashion by BMW M1 sports car and M6 motorway\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ian Tasker.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf we discount the fact that the \xe2\x80\x98Manny Ship\xe2\x80\x99 opens into the south side of the Mersey Estuary, and is therefore in contact with Liverpool and Everton, it pretty much serves Manchester only. The rest of the Inland Waterways network, however, provides a handy \xe2\x80\x98back-door\xe2\x80\x99 escape route for those players who arrived large in proper ships, but who are leaving quietly in rather narrowed circumstances. Manchester is canal-connected to such footballing career safety-nets as Burnley, Blackburn, Wigan, Sheffield and even Leeds. If Runcorn Top Locks on the Bridgewater canal are truly to be reopened, there will also be a useful way to slip such players back out to sea without raising undue attention\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Luke Williams.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
