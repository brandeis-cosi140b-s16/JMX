b'Fernando in line for Manchester City return against Aston Villa'


b'<p>Fernando is back in contention for Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon after five weeks out with a groin injury as the champions look to bridge the five-point gap to Chelsea.</p> <p>The midfielder suffered the problem in City\xe2\x80\x99s 1-0 home defeat to Stoke City on 30 August. Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s team have won only once in the league since while dropping five from the available six points in the Champions League.</p> <p>Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have just one player injured, Samir Nasri. All the others are fit. Both of them [Fernando and Matija Nastasic] are OK.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini shrugged off any notion that there may be concern regarding the gap to Chelsea. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are just starting. It is not good to be five points behind Chelsea. At the moment we have one point more than last year, Arsenal was maybe six points ahead of us. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t win the first three games away. Today, we have seven points from nine away. Different things. It is not good to be five points behind. But things can happen, important things and we will try to continue playing the way we did against Hull.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Regarding whether Joe Hart will play after the goalkeeper was left out for two matches before Tuesday evening\xe2\x80\x99s 1-1 draw with Roma, Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you asking me about the goalkeepers and not the full-backs or the midfield? I have a squad and I make the rotation I think is important for the squad. In every position it is the same. Tomorrow you will see the 11 starters.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Last season City lost in the corresponding fixture with Villa. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember it was a game we played very well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was very similar, though the goals were not the same, to the game against Cardiff. We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t win both games. We lost both games 3-2. After that I think we improve a lot playing away. I hope the game we play last year in Birmingham will be a good experience and we will try to play tomorrow with 100% concentration and intensity you need to win the games.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe have 38 difficult games, some because they are in good moments, some because they are big teams. Aston Villa started very well, maybe in the last two games they are not doing so well but I am sure they will be tomorrow a very difficult team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
