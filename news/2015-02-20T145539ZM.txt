b'<p>When Manuel Pellegrini bought Wilfried Bony from Swansea last month, Manchester City acquired their very own \xe2\x80\x9cspecial one\xe2\x80\x9d. This is how the champions\xe2\x80\x99 new \xc2\xa325m striker, who should make his debut against Newcastle United on Saturday, was viewed at Vitesse Arnhem after joining from Sparta Prague in January 2011.</p> <p>Bony is a flamboyant character who turned up on his first day at the Dutch team in a \xe2\x80\x9clong coat and big car\xe2\x80\x9d but whose talent and professionalism quickly impressed his new team-mates.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI thought he was a special one in everything,\xe2\x80\x9d Marcus Pedersen, a Norway forward who joined Vitesse the summer before Bony, remembers. \xe2\x80\x9cHe trained hard, he\xe2\x80\x99s very strong mentally. I came three months before him, and you saw when he came he was a big striker and everybody talked about [how] he scored a lot at Prague. And you saw after the first training session he looked a very strong striker who can also score goals.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIts difficult to find big [men] to score a lot of goals. So that was a surprise for me, when I saw him, that he was so good a finisher.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Bony joins a City side in need of a striker who knows where the goal is despite the \xc2\xa388m investment in Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic. Before the 4-1 defeat of Stoke City last week the league tally of 47 goals was 21 fewer than on the same day of last term, albeit they had played one game more in 2013-14. Ag\xc3\xbcero\xe2\x80\x99s two at the Britannia Stadium broke a personal duck that went back to 3 December; Dzeko, staggeringly, last scored for City on 27 September; Jovetic has only two goals in nearly three months.</p> <p>No wonder Pellegrini decided to splash out on Bony who, as Pedersen says, is a fiercely powerful operator who is also an accomplished finisher. His record shows he is not fazed by moving up a level, which augurs well for City and suggests Bony can handle the incessant spotlight shone on the Etihad Stadium.</p> <p>The Ivorian scored 22 in 59 league appearances for Sparta, after joining them in 2008 following a loan spell at their B\xc2\xa0team. In two and a half seasons at Vitesse, 46 in 65 was the count. And, over the next 18 months at Swansea, he managed nearly a goal every two league games (25 in 54).</p> <p>Pellegrini will hope Bony\xe2\x80\x99s arrival can boost City\xe2\x80\x99s title defence \xe2\x80\x93 they are seven points behind Chelsea \xe2\x80\x93 and help the team find a way past Lionel Messi\xe2\x80\x99s Barcelona in the last 16 of the Champions League, starting with Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s first leg at the Etihad.</p> <p>Louis Saha, who won two Premier League crowns with Manchester United, believes Bony may make the difference. \xe2\x80\x9cHe could. He\xe2\x80\x99s a terrific player,\xe2\x80\x9d says the former France forward. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have already some really good strikers, so any addition is always a threat for any competitors.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Saha believes \xe2\x80\x9chis presence, his confidence to keep the ball and bring his team-mates [into play]\xe2\x80\x9d will help City. \xe2\x80\x9cWith that quality they obviously have midfielders like Silva and Nasri that can definitely use his reference to go forward. And I think he is a good goalscorer as well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Bony has now completed a first week of training after arriving at City on Monday following the celebrations for the Ivory Coast\xe2\x80\x99s Africa Cup of Nations triumph.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt feels like a while since I signed the contract but finally I\xe2\x80\x99m here, I\xe2\x80\x99m really happy about that and now I\xe2\x80\x99m just focusing on this Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not easy because I\xe2\x80\x99ve just arrived from Africa and I will have had five days of training before we play Newcastle. I have to take it step by step and wait for the right opportunity to present itself.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is interesting training with my new team-mates and to see the way they play and they are also learning what my power and strengths are. Samir Nasri has already told me he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see me on the right or the left \xe2\x80\x93 just to stay in the box.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Despite Nasri\xe2\x80\x99s orders, Bony can play differing striking roles. Pedersen says: \xe2\x80\x9cIn Holland lot of positions are rotated so, yeah, he was a deep striker, he came back to the midfield almost and he could hold the ball and turn.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The 26-year-old is also a positive changing-room presence. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought so,\xe2\x80\x9d adds Pedersen of his colourful former team-mate. \xe2\x80\x9cBony likes to express himself with nice clothes and cars but he\xe2\x80\x99s a very nice guy so it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
