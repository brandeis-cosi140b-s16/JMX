b'Football transfer rumours: Is Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle Wolfsburg bound?'


b'<p>To Mats Hummels, the Champions League is nothing. The Premier League is nothing. Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal are nothing. Dortmund are everything and he\xe2\x80\x99s staying there come hell or tricky relegation six-pointers against Werder Bremen.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFundamentally, I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to play in the Champions League to be happy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, which is fortunate given that Dortmund aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to be anywhere near the competition next season unless they happen to win it this season. He says he wants to stay at the club despite rabid interest from English suitors. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe we will indeed lose players should we not qualify for the Champions League, but what I can tell you is that we should not lose 15 players at once,\xe2\x80\x9d he reckons. The Mill isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to bet on that one.</p> <p>Another player staying where he is for now is Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s David de Gea. But that\xe2\x80\x99s only because the \xc2\xa350m price tag that the club have strung around his neck is so heavy that he physically cannot move. Is it a ruse so that United can do a swap deal with Real Madrid for Gareth Bale? Who knows, but Louis van Gaal has realised that playing five, four, three or tea ladies and toddlers in defence isn\xe2\x80\x99t working very well so is now apparently more interested in signing Hummels \xe2\x80\x93 who, as we know, is going nowhere \xe2\x80\x93 and Kevin Strootman in the summer. Even though Strootman is a midfielder, he\xe2\x80\x99ll settle for bringing Gerard Piqu\xc3\xa9 back from Barcelona though.</p> <p>Real Madrid are in the process of playing an elaborate game of peekaboo with Juventus over Paul Pogba, in which they say they are interested, then say they are not. They are, however, expected to announce a deal for the Norwegian whelp Martin Odegaard any time now.</p> <p>Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle was a very good player in Germany. Then he came to Chelsea and was a very promising player in England. Then he got A Mystery Illness and has been bobbins, nicking the ball off Oscar\xe2\x80\x99s feet and denying him a hat-trick against Swansea to make matters worse at the weekend. Wolfsburg want to lure him back to Germany and have \xc2\xa323m ready to proive they\xe2\x80\x99re serious. Chelsea want \xc2\xa330m and not a penny less.</p> <p>Another player hoping to head to Germany to revive a career is Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s anti-marksman Roberto Soldado who is hoping the goals in the Bundesliga are a foot wider and are hung 20 foot up in the air so he might find them more often. Bayer Leverkusen are making the necessary adjustments.</p> <p>Sami Khedira\xe2\x80\x99s heading to Arsenal, right? Erm, no. Look away Arsenal fans, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger is about to be Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger. Instead of splashing the cash, he wants to look within to strengthen. \xe2\x80\x9cHaving to find solutions internally is a blessing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, conjuring all sorts of images. What he meant was that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to offer Francis Coquelin a new deal on the back of one half decent performance against Manchester City.</p> <p>Garry Monk has a whole lot of Wilfried Bony money burning a hole in his pocket and he wants to splurge it on the Stuttgart midfielder Alexandru Maxim and on Norwich\xe2\x80\x99s Martin Olsson. Stuttgart have turned their noses up at \xc2\xa35.5m, but Olsson wants out of Norwich, which is odd since its town sign says it\xe2\x80\x99s a fine city so who does he think he is to judge?</p> <p>Finally, the Australian stopper Matthew Ryan wants to go to Liverpool which is handy because they\xe2\x80\x99re in the market for that sort of thing. Kevin Mirallas\xe2\x80\x99s days at Everton could be numbered after his penalty nonsense on Monday night, and Arsenal, Everton and Liverpool have been giving Leeds United\xe2\x80\x99s Sam Byram the sort of glad eye more commonly employed in Ritzy\xe2\x80\x99s on a Friday night.</p>'
