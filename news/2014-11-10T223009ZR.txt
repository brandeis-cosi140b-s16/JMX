b'Ryan Bertrand baffled by England selection criteria after missing out'


b'<p>The Southampton defender Ryan Bertrand has said he is unsure of the criteria required to earn a place in the England squad, admitting his disappointment at missing out on Roy Hodgson\xe2\x80\x99s most recent selection.</p> <p>Bertrand, on loan from Chelsea, has played a significant part in Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s excellent start to the Premier League season, the full-back having played 90 minutes in each of their last four clean sheets. However, he was overlooked by Hodgson for the matches against Slovenia and Scotland.</p> <p>His Southampton team-mate, Nathaniel Clyne, did earn a place in Hodgson\xe2\x80\x99s 26-man squad but Bertrand was surprised at his own omission.</p> <p>Asked if he was disappointed not to be in the England squad, Bertrand said: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, very. I\xe2\x80\x99ve started very well this season, we\xe2\x80\x99re second in the league, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the criteria is to get in there at the minute.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The 25-year-old does still hold out hope of receiving a call-up. When asked if he felt confident of getting a chance for England at some point this season, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, definitely. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I thought. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not down to me. I feel like I should have achieved that already, so hopefully it will come.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ronald Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s side have conceded only one home goal this season and going into the international break are second in the Premier League table, four points behind leaders Chelsea and four ahead of third-placed Manchester City following a 2-0 victory over Leicester City on Saturday.</p> <p>Bertrand believes Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s performances at home have created a buzz within the team and that sides fear to play at St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s good, it\xe2\x80\x99s very good, especially before the international break to get a win. That\xe2\x80\x99s the most important thing, to make sure we win. Now we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a little break and come back and do the same thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLeicester was another game we were fully in control of. It\xe2\x80\x99s making it a bit of a trend, when teams come in and are shutting up shop and defending really well, so the onus is on us to create something and break the deadlock. It\xe2\x80\x99s a compliment in a way, but very frustrating in another sense. But it\xe2\x80\x99s credit to the boys that we managed to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
