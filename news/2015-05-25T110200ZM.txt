b'Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s Phil Jones expects strong start to next season'


b'<p>Phil Jones believes Manchester United will hit the ground running next season, with the central defender stating the team will also be ready for the Champions League play-off in mid-August.</p> <p>United began this season poorly, managing only 13 points from their first 10 matches, which was their worst start in the league since 1986-87. The new Premier League season starts on 8 August and the first leg of their Champions League play-off will take place on 18 or 19 August, with the return leg a week later, and Jones is conscious that finding top form in the opening games is crucial.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to start well next season, for definite,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jones. \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure we will have a good pre-season under our belts. We will go away now and have a rest, recuperate and think about the season and how we have done, what we can improve on and we will come back ready to go again next season. The main thing was that we tried to qualify for the Champions League this season and we have done that, albeit with a difficult qualifying game to come. But we will be ready for that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Jones admits a sense of regret regarding those opening 10 games. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you look at games like Sunderland and Burnley away, when we drew, if we could have picked up three points instead of one in places like that then you give yourself a better chance. But that is the way the season has gone and we are reasonably satisfied,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>Jones described United\xe2\x80\x99s fourth place finish as successful but said that no one at the club is ecstatic about a season in which the points total of 70 was 17 short of Chelsea, the champions. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it has been successful. It was never going to be easy, it is always difficult when you have a change of manager, but I think we have done well. We started the season off slowly, we should have picked up a few more points than we did, but we have finished the season strongly and I think it has been a reasonably successful season on the whole,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not kidding ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a steady progression. We are not absolutely ecstatic about finishing in fourth \xe2\x80\x93 that is not the case at all. We are satisfied at finishing fourth and the aim was to finish in that position at least at the start of the season. We have done what we needed to do in a way but we need to improve upon that next season.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of his own form Jones, who has made 23 starts in all competitions, said: \xe2\x80\x9cI think it has been reasonably good. I had a good run of games from the middle to the back end of the season when I felt like I was in really good form at the time. A little injury and then I was out for a game, but hopefully next season and I can have an even stronger season.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 0-0 draw at Hull City, V\xc3\xadctor Vald\xc3\xa9s made his full debut in goal for United. David de Gea may leave for Real Madrid this summer and if so Vald\xc3\xa9s is in contention to replace him. Jones said he has been impressed with the former Barcelona goalkeeper. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was terrific. He pulled off some wonderful saves for us. He was key at vital moments in the game and they threw a lot at us but he was always there and he stood firm. Credit to him because he is a great goalkeeper. He has very good English and he is good at communicating.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
