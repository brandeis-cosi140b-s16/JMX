b'<p>ONE FOR THE STAMP COLLECTION</p> <p>Imagine if everything ran on Steven Gerrard Time. Everything would happen much faster and we would get so much done. The Fiver would hit its deadlines, maybe even write some funny jokes along the way, and then it would have time to find a cure for the common cold or, at the very least, buy a new pair of trousers for the first time since 1997. There would be no traffic. No one would stand in your way on the escalator at train stations. Larry David would be on the 375th series of Curb Your Enthusiasm by now, instead of keeping us waiting since the summer of 2011 for the ninth series. What a world that would be. You can get a taste of what it is like by simply injecting yourself with some sugar, making sure to hit those veins (recommended dosage: 10 table spoons of the stuff every 15 minutes).</p> <p>Sadly that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give you the full, genuine experience, as SGT currently only exists in the mind of a 34-year-old toddler with an unfortunate case of superhero syndrome and there can be the occasional complication. Take Steven \xe2\x80\x9cThe Flash\xe2\x80\x9d Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s comedy cameo during Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 defeat by Manchester United yesterday. With Liverpool trailing 1-0 and in dire need of a shot of energy, Brendan Rodgers naturally turned to the man who has performed so many rescue acts in the past, but how the ploy backfired. SGT went into overdrive, spilling over into our reality, with Anfield watching in stunned silence as Whirlwind Gerrard obliterated everything in its path during a mesmeric 38-second spell in which Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s captain managed to cram in 572 laps of the pitch, a shuddering tackle on Juan Mata, a Hollywood pass and a red-card stamp on Ander Herrera. Silly Stevie! Silly Stampy Stevie! What a way to bow out in your final match against United. What a way to dent Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s hopes of finishing in the top four.</p> <p>Gerrard later appeared in front of the television cameras to apologise for his frankly hilarious part in a defeat that leaves Liverpool five points behind United with eight games to play, although he was speaking so quickly that the Fiver failed to catch him saying sorry to Herrera for standing on his leg. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is big of someone when they do get sent off to come out and apologise,\xe2\x80\x9d Rodgers said, who may need some emergency dental work after gritting his teeth throughout his press conference. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was man enough to come out and apologise.\xe2\x80\x9d The Fiver admires such magnificent selflessness, not that Gerrard has had time to absorb the praise. He\xe2\x80\x99s been busy doing shuttle runs between Merseyside and Australia.</p> GONE IN 38 SECONDS            <p>And here it is, in all its brick-by-brick glory.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>11.34am: \xe2\x80\x9cWe know how much this club means to Shaun and Greg and we know how much hard work they had both put in during their time here. However, we have to make the decisions that we feel are in the best interests of the club and our perilous position in the table meant that we felt we needed to make a change\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Notts County chief suit, Aileen Trew, says the most negative thing any employed person can hear as she ushers Shaun Derry and Greg Abbott through the door marked Do One.</p> <p>11.35am: \xe2\x80\x9cI have nothing but positive things to say about Shaun and Greg\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Notts County chief suit Aileen Trew\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to cushion the crushing blow of said news just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t quite sit right. </p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMay I be one of the first of 1,057 pedants to remind Mike Coxon that the Dyer/Bowyer bout was in 2005 and not the 1990s. At the risk of being accused of attempting to resurrect the dead \xe2\x80\x93 I was there in the posh seats at the invitation of my boss. We were given a little badge, then had turbot and Chardonnay before the game and more booze at half-time. I was within spitting distance of Mr Souness but didn\xe2\x80\x99t. When the fight broke out I was impressed that the combatants had the good manners to kick-off right in front of the directors\xe2\x80\x99 box. I was about to stand and give them the thumbs up, but the ref had already given them the red card. How times have changed\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Justin Johnson.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cCan I be the first of 1,057 mystifyingly well-adjusted fully grown men to suggest that Mike Coxon might be a bit optimistic thinking the Fiver will make football/wrestling crossover puns (Friday\xe2\x80\x99s letters), given their lack of interest in an obvious play on Joe/Bret \xe2\x80\x98the Hitman\xe2\x80\x99 Hart (or any of his extended family). The Hitman\xe2\x80\x99s catchphrase was to describe himself as \xe2\x80\x98the best there is, the best there was, and the best there ever will be\xe2\x80\x99. Not sure how this applies to the Fiver, mind\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ed Taylor.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cA 1934 friendly between Austria Vienna? A top, top manager suffering from artificial-hip airport BING! And the draw for the Big Vase quarter-finals? Surely the Fiver can get an anorak manufacturer in search of a younger, hipster market to throw them a few tailor-made prizes for your readers? You could even offer them the use of the \xe2\x80\x98As worn by Weird Uncle Fiver\xe2\x80\x99 slogan\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Justin Kavanagh.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

Not that anyone really cares about Jes\xc3\xa9 though, because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t cost the price of an island in the south Pacific.</p> <p>The Blackpool chief suit, Karl Oyston, has been charged with misconduct following a text-message exchange with a supporter during which he called the fan a \xe2\x80\x9cmassive retard\xe2\x80\x9d. </p> <p>And the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Celtic have been fined \xc2\xa310,000 by Uefa wrist-slappers after players acted up and fans got busy with fireworks and flares in Big Vase against Inter last month.</p> RECOMMENDED LISTENING      <p>AC Jimbo and co talk Premier League, La Liga, Euro football, Big Vase and even Tin O\xe2\x80\x99 Paint Trophy.</p> STILL WANT MORE? <p>The football writers usually like to spend Sunday evening, sitting around the the old Joanna, signing songs from Engelbert Humperdinck\xe2\x80\x99s Grammy Award-nominated album, Always Hear The Harmony: The Gospel Sessions.

But he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there to sample the turrons in Sirvent or the traditional Catalan cuisine in Nou Celler, he was there to watch El Cl\xc3\xa1sico. Here are his thoughts on that and the rest of the weekend\xe2\x80\x99s action in La Liga.</p> <p>Paolo Bandini also spent Sunday night watching football on TV \xe2\x80\x93 and his eye was caught by former professional carbonara eater Felipe Anderson and his antics in the Lazio shirt.</p> <p>Did you spend your Sunday night being ridiculed and bullied by your friends when you stuck up for Michael Carrick?
