b'<p>Paul Scholes believes Manchester United need to make five major signings to arrest their decline, or they risk \xe2\x80\x9cgoing into the wilderness in the same way that Liverpool did in the 1990s\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>The former United midfielder, reacting to the club\xe2\x80\x99s miserable 2013-14 campaign and this season\xe2\x80\x99s opening day defeat at home to Swansea, said he felt \xe2\x80\x9cgenuinely scared\xe2\x80\x9d for the club\xe2\x80\x99s long-term future, and urged vice-chairman Ed Woodward to make signings quickly.</p> <p>Calling the situation \xe2\x80\x9cdesperate\xe2\x80\x9d, Scholes wrote in the Independent: \xe2\x80\x9cLet me be clear: I am sick of having to criticise the club which I gave my life to as a footballer. But United need to arrest their decline.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI feel it is time for major change. What do United need? Five players. Not five players with potential. Five experienced players \xe2\x80\xa6 for now. Five proper players who can hit the ground running and turn around a situation that looks desperate. United\xe2\x80\x99s forwards are as good as any team in the league. The problem is what comes behind them.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy five would be: Xabi Alonso, Sami Khedira, Rapha\xc3\xabl Varane, Angel Di Maria and Mats Hummels. It would be one very big cheque for Real Madrid, given that four of them would come from that club. It would be hard to land them all. But that is the level that United need at this stage of the transfer window.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Scholes also said he felt the structural problems at United were long-standing. \xe2\x80\x9cI suppose I should have realised that the very fact I was still playing for United at 38 years old was a sign that there was not enough pressure on us senior players from those coming into the side.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe sad, and worrying, aspect of it all, after watching Manchester City and Chelsea over the first three days of the season, is that United are not on that level. They may not even be on the same level as Arsenal and Liverpool, who I think are the next grade down. United must make some signings in the last two weeks of the transfer window.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEd Woodward keeps telling us that the money is there. I would say that now is the time to start spending it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
