b'Raheem Sterling must learn from Liverpool heroes, says Lucas Leiva | Paul Wilson'


b'<p>Lucas Leiva\xe2\x80\x99s take on the controversy at present surrounding Raheem Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s leisure time activities is that footballers should be role models \xe2\x80\x93 for each other. Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Brazilian midfielder is reluctant to list himself among the club\xe2\x80\x99s senior professionals, although he has been there for eight years, but his advice to younger players is to do what he did and learn from the established names in the dressing room.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was very young when I came here and, when I looked around, I would see Steven Gerrard, Xabi Alonso or Pepe Reina and how they conducted themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were real role models. They were successful not just because of their talent but because they did things the right way. These days it is hard to give any kind of advice to young players because they have so many people around them. Ten years ago you had more space. Now you have to be extra careful because everyone is filming or taking pictures on their phones. All I would say is don\xe2\x80\x99t get carried away by it all, just watch and learn from the players you respect.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Lucas struggled to break into the Liverpool team at first because Gerrard, Alonso and Javier Mascherano were all ahead of him. Now only Gerrard is left and he will be bowing out at the end of the season. When Lucas came to England in 2007 he joined a club that had just won the FA Cup and been to two Champions League finals. Since then there has been a solitary League Cup success and he missed it through injury.</p> <p>Not only will Sunday afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa be his first appearance at Wembley but the competition represents his best chance yet of ridding himself of an unwanted record. With 271 appearances under his belt, Lucas is the longest-serving Liverpool player never to have won a medal since the club regained top-flight status in 1962.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a little disappointing but Liverpool have been through a lot in the past few years,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe change in ownership and everything that went with it affected the club, a lot of senior players left, there were big changes in the squad and at some point you have to pay a price for that. It had to be done but the main thing now is that the club is moving forward again. For the new generation, the one that has come on since Brendan Rodgers came in, this is their second semi-final. We lost the first one against Chelsea but this is special. It is at Wembley. We have a lot of belief and confidence that we can reach the final. It would be a very nice reward for a hard-working group of players.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The general view is that the FA Cup could save Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s season, though despite Lucas\xe2\x80\x99s yearning for a trophy he is realistic about what would actually constitute the ideal end to the campaign. Since Manuel Pellegrini described Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s final eight games as eight cup finals his side have managed to lose the first two of them to sink to fourth. Any more slips could see Liverpool edge past to qualify for next season\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is still open,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIf City drop points we will try to make the most of it. We just have to keep winning our games and see where it takes us. We were not as good as City in the end last season. We have to hope this season might be different. Certainly the belief is still there.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf you look at the table, our bad start is costing us at the moment. If we had managed two or three more wins we would be challenging for second or third. Of course I am interested in medals and trophies but I also want to be playing at the highest level. That is what the Champions League means and that is what the club needs. It is hard to choose between the FA Cup and the Champions League but maybe at the end of the season we could achieve everything we want. If we won the FA Cup and got top four again it would be an incredible achievement.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Now 28, Lucas is on his fourth Liverpool manager and apart from Rafael Ben\xc3\xadtez, who signed him for the future, he has had to win them all over. Supporters, too, took a while to appreciate his qualities, though now he is a valued member of the squad who will become even more important on Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s exit.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t think I was going to stay this long. I felt I might be gone after the first season,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe time goes fast but I am still here and still proud to play for Liverpool. The last injury set me back a little bit but in the last couple of games I felt back to the level I was before, which is great. When I am fit and well I think I can offer a lot to the team. I just need to carry on like that because [knocks theatrically on the wooden desk in front of him] I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had the best of luck with injuries.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>A first FA Cup final for Lucas would also be a last one for Gerrard and a Liverpool win on Sunday could mark the start of one of the longest goodbyes in football, a sentimental and sickly-sweet scousefest building up to a tearful departure on the grandest stage of all. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s his birthday as well, which would make it even more special,\xe2\x80\x9d Lucas says with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course it would be brilliant for Stevie, and he deserves it, but everybody else here deserves a trophy too. Stevie has won many trophies. The rest of us are waiting to get started.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
