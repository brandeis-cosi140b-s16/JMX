b'<p>Tuesday marks the fourth anniversary of Alan Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s installation as Newcastle United\xe2\x80\x99s manager and he cites a remarkable absence of arguments with Mike Ashley as one reason for this longevity.</p> <p>In the business sphere Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s owner has a reputation as a most demanding employer but Pardew claims to have experienced only his more holistic side. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very important to have a solid relationship with your chairman or owner and I\xe2\x80\x99ve always had that with Mike,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s manager.</p> <p>Ashley confounded many by standing by Pardew as Newcastle struggled for much of 2014 before recently winning six games in a row, but it seems no cross words were exchanged during this prolonged rough patch.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMe and Mike don\xe2\x80\x99t really have too much communication,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut when we do it\xe2\x80\x99s really constructive. We\xe2\x80\x99ve never had a destructive conversation since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been here. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s very helpful because I\xe2\x80\x99ve had them at other clubs. The link between owner and manager is very important but sometimes it can get lost in the wash a little bit. Chief executives can get involved and the relationship gets distant.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pardew has been further bolstered by the security of a controversial eight-year contract but feels that both he and Ashley deserve praise for making their partnership work through the tough times on Tyneside.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s credit to the owner and also credit to me because I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to dig in a few times. Sometimes his flag is up the pole and sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s mine. But I think we both knew that when we signed that long contract, that there were going to be difficult days as well as good days for us both.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s manager is horrified that his length of tenure makes him a rarity in the increasingly turbulent world of English football. Indeed, only Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger, Exeter\xe2\x80\x99s Paul Tisdale and Karl Robinson at MK Dons have been in post longer.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI noticed that Mark [Yates] got sacked at Cheltenham, so I think I\xe2\x80\x99m fourth on the list of the League\xe2\x80\x99s longest-serving managers now, which is very disturbing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat isn\xe2\x80\x99t a good stat at all.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSince Tony Pulis left Crystal Palace by mutual agreement a Premier League manager hasn\xe2\x80\x99t left this season, which is unusual. Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s beginning to stabilise a little bit, although perhaps I\xe2\x80\x99m speaking to soon. The Championship is the bigger worry at the moment, because nine months is the average tenure. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how long it takes other people to get to know their jobs but nine months is certainly not enough for the coach of a football team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He can further reinforce his own job security by choreographing a repeat of the 2-0 win Newcastle enjoyed against Chelsea in the Premier League at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park last season. Thirteen months after that victory Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side have been revamped and Pardew expects a considerably tougher challenge in the north east on Saturday lunchtime.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say they\xe2\x80\x99re on a different level but we\xe2\x80\x99re playing a much better team than came here last year,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been watching Chelsea since I was 12. I used to watch John Neal\xe2\x80\x99s team on a regular basis but this is as good a Chelsea as I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen. Whether they can continue like this is a big question mark, though, because they have quite a few players who haven\xe2\x80\x99t won the Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 yet.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>There seems little chance of complacency in the visiting ranks. \xe2\x80\x9cJos\xc3\xa9 knows this is a tricky game,\xe2\x80\x9d says Pardew. \xe2\x80\x9cHe won\xe2\x80\x99t come here complacent. He never does. That\xe2\x80\x99s the art of his management and something that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think gets carried through at some other clubs. Chelsea certainly won\xe2\x80\x99t go unbeaten in all competitions but it\xe2\x80\x99s not impossible for them to stay unbeaten in the Premier League this season.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>An impressive defensive performance by Sunderland earned Gus Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s side a draw with Chelsea at the Stadium of Light last Saturday but Newcastle will not be emulating their neighbours. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, we won\xe2\x80\x99t do the same,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pardew. \xe2\x80\x9cI think Chelsea will score, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll need to score twice.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
