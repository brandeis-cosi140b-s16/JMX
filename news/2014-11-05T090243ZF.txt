b'Football transfer rumours: Ron Vlaar moving to Manchester United?'


b'<p>The Mill has become used to the existence of the transfer window in recent years. Outside of it, the gruel is not always as thick as it once was. We try out a faddy diet or two. Breathe deeply, lustily, fully. Because you never quite know what form your next hit of nourishment will take.</p> <p>So excuse us if we pop out for a week\xe2\x80\x99s supply of kale and book ourselves on to a spa retreat because we\xe2\x80\x99re in a bit of a vacuum this morning. It\xe2\x80\x99s not that there is nothing going on. There is a lot going on, or a lot of talking about things going on. It\xe2\x80\x99s just that not much of it is particularly constructive.</p> <p>Take Manchester United and Radamel Falcao. A big-name match made in heaven, you might say. A loan set to be consummated next summer, you could well believe. Positive stuff all round. But apparently not, because rumour has it that Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s feet are getting a little cold. Falcao, who missed the Chelsea and Manchester City games through injury, has not convinced the manager that he can handle the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s physical demands and a situation appears to have arisen whereby he must Change Louis\xe2\x80\x99 Mind. Any good news? Any exciting alternatives? None whatsoever.</p> <p>There is more \xe2\x80\x93 or perhaps less. The Telegraph says that United are prepared to spend \xc2\xa31.4m to terminate the contract of Anderson if nobody will have the decency even to be linked with him.</p> <p>The air is similarly stifling up at The Hawthorns. Brown Ideye joined West Bromwich Albion in the summer for what did seem at the time like a rather steep \xc2\xa310m, and it is no falsehood to state that things could have begun a little better for the Nigerian. He has scored just once in six appearances, three of those in the Capital One Cup, and cannot make the bench at the moment. And Alan Irvine is having none of it \xe2\x80\x93 much as you might think a little acclimatisation is required of a man most recently used to the rather mellower tempo of the Ukrainian league. According to the Mirror, Irvine wants to get shot in January and is casting around for a replacement. Who? No idea.</p> <p>There isn\xe2\x80\x99t much constructive news to report further south either. You might think Arsenal need a few new signings after last night\xe2\x80\x99s merry old fiasco and nobody has felt like one more often than Abou Diaby in recent years. But the Mail says that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be someone else\xe2\x80\x99s real new signing soon enough, with Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger prepared to let him go when his contract finishes at the end of the season. Joking aside, it looks like a sad end for a player of extraordinary talent.</p> <p>The best spin we can put on any of this is that all four will be like birds released into the wild. But for those who like their rumours bookended with origin A and destination B, there are still a few to keep us staggering through the day. United aren\xe2\x80\x99t going to let this Falcao business stop them from trying to plug a defence hitherto neglected to the point of hilarity, and are making eyes at Aston Villa\xe2\x80\x99s Ron Vlaar. They also fancy a pop at the Benfica midfielder Enzo P\xc3\xa9rez.</p> <p>In perhaps the least surprising seemingly-done-deal of this transfer window, it seems that unknown Toronto FC forward Jermain Defoe could be rewarding an exhaustive stint of scouting by Harry Redknapp and pitching up at QPR before very long at all.</p> <p>And how\xe2\x80\x99s this for a late, desperate rumours binge? Spurs, say the Mirror again, are looking at no fewer than three new forwards. The Colombian Te\xc3\xb3filo Guti\xc3\xa9rrez is one; Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s currently-crocked Jay Rodriguez is another, the Borussia M\xc3\xb6nchengladbach winger Patrick Herrmann is the third. Much-needed succour for the Mill, this, but it feels rather like the trip to McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s before the yoga class. So that will do for today; we\xe2\x80\x99re off to Whole Foods.</p>'
