b'Asian Cup semi-final: Australia 2-0 UAE \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>Australia are in the final and that\xe2\x80\x99s the important thing. They\xe2\x80\x99ll get a chance to win, on home soil, their first Asian Cup but to do so they will have to find a way through South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s staunch defence. </p> <p>I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say they\xe2\x80\x99ll need to lift from tonight\xe2\x80\x99s performance. Australia started well and were full of running as expected. But it was almost as if the two early goals took away their edge, their Eye of the Tiger if you will. The UAE weren\xe2\x80\x99t crash hot themselves and though Khalil, particularly, and Omar schemed, they never looked like overhauling Australia\xe2\x80\x99s early lead. But they should be pleased with their showing at the tournament. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they exceeded all their expectations.</p> <p>Australia can now focus on the final. </p> <p>A few quick words from goalscorer Jason Davidson before I go: \xe2\x80\x9cSince I left home at 14 it was always my dream to play for the green and gold. And to score a goal for the team and help them get to the Asian Cup final is a dream come true.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Join us on Saturday night for what we hope will be an historic night for Australian football. Thanks for your emails and eyes. Cheerio!</p>'
