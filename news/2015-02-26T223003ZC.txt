b'Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Diego Costa: I need to be \xe2\x80\x98extra careful\xe2\x80\x99 after stamping ban'


b'<p>Diego Costa believes his reputation precedes him in English football, provoking greater scrutiny from officials and pundits, and the Spain forward admits he must be \xe2\x80\x9cextra careful\xe2\x80\x9d in the wake of his recent three-match ban for stamping.</p> <p>The Brazil-born striker maintains he did not intentionally tread on Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Emre Can in the second leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final, an offence for which he was punished retrospectively by the Football Association. Yet he will go into Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s final against Tottenham Hotspur still experiencing the ramifications of that incident and, while he refuses to change his natural game, he has suggested he has effectively become a target.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to change my way of playing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Costa, whose 17 goals for Chelsea have all come in the Premier League. \xe2\x80\x9cI do know now that I have to be a little bit more careful because it\xe2\x80\x99s not the same when I do something as when someone else does it. Something I do, it\xe2\x80\x99s talked about much more than another player. I have to be extra careful but I\xe2\x80\x99m never going to change the way I play. That\xe2\x80\x99s what got me here, that\xe2\x80\x99s the way I play.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The striker, a \xc2\xa332m arrival from Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid last summer, has been booked eight times this season, though only once since mid-December, but has quickly established himself as integral at Chelsea as the focus of the forward line. There was a flurry of early goals though he has now not scored since 17 January, with Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho having suggested in the build-up to his return at Paris Saint-Germain last week that he might need time to regain his former match sharpness. Costa\xe2\x80\x99s three-game ban had actually ruled him out for three weeks, checking the momentum that had seen him strike six goals in his previous 10 appearances.</p> <p>While he still disagrees with the ban, the 26-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s focus is firmly set upon winning the first silverware of his Chelsea career \xe2\x80\x93 as well as of Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s second spell in charge \xe2\x80\x93 at Spurs\xe2\x80\x99 expense. \xe2\x80\x9cThe suspension has gone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Costa, who will be playing at Wembley for the first time. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s one thing that happened, and now I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to get back to my best physical form. You have just to forget about it. I joined a club like Chelsea to win titles. As we say, finals are not there to be played. They are there to be won. I will go into the game with the mentality and have the motivation to come away with the title.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAfter last season I had a few [hamstring] injuries and then, when I was on top form and was playing at my best, I had that suspension \xe2\x80\x93 and I still don\xe2\x80\x99t even know why that happened. Now, I\xe2\x80\x99m running a little bit behind, trying to do my best, working hard and hopefully I\xe2\x80\x99ll be 100%. As for not scoring recently, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t worry me. The truth is I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know how many games it has been. What worries me is to be in the best physical form to score goals. Never mind the opposition. We all know we are a good team and we have the quality to win.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>These two sides have met twice in the Premier League already this season, with Spurs\xe2\x80\x99 thumping 5-3 win on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day their first in the derby in 11 attempts stretching back to 2010. The last time the teams met at Wembley was in the 2012 FA Cup semi-final, when Didier Drogba inspired a 5-1 rout. Yet the Ivorian, who will start on the bench on Sunday, remains scarred by memories of his only defeat at the national stadium, 2-1 to Tottenham in the 2008 League Cup final when he scored the opener only for goals from Dimitar Berbatov and Jonathan Woodgate, in extra-time, to secure the trophy for Spurs.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve only lost once in a Wembley final \xe2\x80\x93 and we all know who that was against,\xe2\x80\x9d said Drogba. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Wembley has been very good to me over the years, that is the way I would prefer to describe it. It was a difficult one to take [in 2008] because I had only just returned from the African Nations Cup and it was only my second game back for Chelsea. We started well but lost to the better team: it was as simple as that. Most of the time, when you win a cup final, it is because you are the better team on the day, and this time it was Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s day.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn the same way that we are capable of giving Tottenham a hard life, you could say they made it very difficult for us at White Hart Lane the last time we played them.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey are a good team, they play good football and on paper I would say it\xe2\x80\x99s an even contest \xe2\x80\x93 which would make it even more enjoyable to score goals against them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
