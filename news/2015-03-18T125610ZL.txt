b"<p>For the first time in five years France will have two Ligue 1 sides in the quarter-finals of the Champions League and, although both Paris Saint-Germain (last week against Chelsea) and Monaco (against Arsenal on Tuesday night), scraped through, the French media has enjoyed the fact that the successes came against two supposedly superior English Premier League opponents.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBingo\xe2\x80\x9d read the front page of L\xe2\x80\x99Equipe as they made no effort to hide the fortuitous nature of Monaco\xe2\x80\x99s ability to survive an Arsenal onslaught at Stade Louis II. \xe2\x80\x9cShoved, dominated, beaten, but qualified\xe2\x80\x9d continued the sports daily, while \xe2\x80\x9cunsustainable and formidable\xe2\x80\x9d was another description of their achievement.</p> <p>L\xe2\x80\x99Equipe then went for a French-English amalgamation to rub salt into the Gunners\xe2\x80\x99 wounds, branding Arsenal an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc3\xa9ternel loser\xe2\x80\x9d. R\xc3\xa9gis Testelin wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cOnce again, the Gunners exit the competition in magnificent defeat, like an eternal loser, the sceptics will add. The consolation is small, but it is a way of erasing their slip-up in the home leg and reinforcing their objective between now and the end of the season: finishing in a podium position in the Premier League. Beaten 3-1 at home, Arsenal only had a 2% chance to qualify, but they were very close in the end.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger hurting but Monaco\xe2\x80\x99s Jardim accuses Arsenal of disrespect </p>   <p>The paper acknowledged Mesut \xc3\x96zil\xe2\x80\x99s impressive performance, labelling him \xe2\x80\x9can inspiration\xe2\x80\x9d, and also paid tribute to Danijel Subasic\xe2\x80\x99s excellent performance in the Monaco goal, heralding him as \xe2\x80\x9csuper Suba\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>A flick inside to view both teams\xe2\x80\x99 player ratings had the Gunners superior to their Monegasque opponents in a match only given a three out of five-star rating for entertainment.</p> <p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s men were handed two seven out of 10 performers \xe2\x80\x93 something of an achievement considering L\xe2\x80\x99Equipe\xe2\x80\x99s notoriously hard to please marking system \xe2\x80\x93 in \xc3\x96zil and Santi Cazorla, with a handful of sixes. Only the Monaco goalkeeper Subasic got the same mark for the home team, with Aymen Abdennour, Wallace and the captain J\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9my Toulalan\xe2\x80\x99s scores of six telling their own story about the defensive nature of the performance put in by Leonardo Jardim\xe2\x80\x99s side.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s inability to take enough of their chances on the night was emphasised in the French press and Les Bleus scorer of the Gunners\xe2\x80\x99 opener Olivier Giroud bore the brunt of the criticism.</p> <p>Le Parisien went with \xe2\x80\x9cGiroud did not do enough\xe2\x80\x9d although they did note that the 28-year-old appeared \xe2\x80\x9cmore determined than ever\xe2\x80\x9d during the game in an attempt to take a positive from their compatriots\xe2\x80\x99 elimination.

As mentioned, this is the first time since Bordeaux and Lyon clashed in the last eight in that season that two French sides have reached this stage and Marseille and PSG are the only teams from Le Championnat to have made it there since.</p>     L\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\x89quipe\xe2\x80\x99s front page on Wednesday morning. Photograph: L'\xc3\x89quipe    <p>Lyon made it one step further that time, five years ago, ousting Bordeaux 3-2 on aggregate to reach the semi-finals before eventual elimination at the hands of Bayern Munich. After seeing both of their representatives progress 3-3 on away goals this season, France can now delight in the fact that one or both of their teams could make it as far or further than Les Gones did.</p> <p>Could 2015 in Berlin even witness another French finalist? It is not impossible but there is still much work to be done and Ligue 1 has had only two Champions League finalists, both 11 years apart. Marseille triumphed against Milan in Munich in 1993 and Monaco were beaten by Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s Porto in Gelsenkirchen in 2004.</p>"
