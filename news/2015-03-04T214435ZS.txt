b'Stoke City 2-0 Everton | Premier League match report'


b'<p>Victor Moses was the hero as Stoke City moved comfortably past the 40-point safety threshold with a gritty victory over Everton, who are still 12 points short of that target and remain on the fringes of the relegation fight.</p> <p>Stoke were worth their win, if only for the excellence of Moses\xe2\x80\x99 first-half goal and general attacking play. The Chelsea loanee was one of the few players on the pitch willing to take on opponents and on several occasions he proved capable of beating them, too. Everton are going to have to fight harder than this if they are going to climb away from trouble. The visitors neither battled like a David Moyes team nor passed like a Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez one, with the result that Stoke, who keep things relatively simple and know what they are good at, saw them off with surprisingly few alarms.</p> <p>Aaron Lennon returned to the Everton starting lineup to face the team he rejected joining on loan in January and was booed from the outset, though for the most part he was as innocuous out wide as he proved to be in his latter seasons at Tottenham. Gareth Barry\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to recover possession from Charlie Adam led to an early booking that will put him out for the next two matches, his 10th caution of the season triggering an automatic suspension.</p> <p>There was little football to speak of at first. Everton hoofed more long balls in the direction of Romelu Lukaku than Stoke launched towards Peter Crouch, neither with any sign of success. Moses showed some neat touches for the home side but initially could not get into the game, while Everton had the most tenacious and hard-working midfielder in the splendidly consistent James McCarthy.</p> <p>It took half an hour for the game to warm up, which it did when Tim Howard was called upon to make the first save of any note, punching clear when Moses escaped S\xc3\xa9amus Coleman to send in a shot from the edge of the area.</p> <p>That woke the crowd up, as did an altercation on Stoke\xe2\x80\x99s right touchline soon afterwards, when McCarthy and Steven Naismith ganged up on Phil Bardsley. That led indirectly to the first goal, when Bardsley sent a cross over from the same wing that Moses met with a stunning header.</p> <p>With the Everton defence all too aware of the aerial threat posed by Crouch, Moses rose almost unchallenged to guide a header past Howard from just beyond the penalty spot. It was a goal of some quality, though sadly the only thing meriting such a description in a disjointed first period. \xe2\x80\x9cVictor has always had a great leap,\xe2\x80\x9d the admiring Mark Hughes said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a fantastic header, great power and placement.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Everton began the second half slightly more promisingly. Lukaku finally managed to find space for a shot that took a slight deflection and Arouna Kon\xc3\xa9 came on to test Asmir Begovic almost immediately, though Everton goal attempts were sporadic. Hughes kept making attacking substitutions and eventually they paid off for the Stoke manager.</p> <p>City were simply defending in the closing stages, with even Moses getting back to help, before they found the energy to make a decisive breakaway six minutes from time. Mame Biram Diouf ran clear from the centre circle with Phil Jagielka in his wake, found Marko Arnautovic overlapping on his right, and when his fellow substitute\xe2\x80\x99s shot came back off the far post Diouf was still onside for a simple tap-in.</p> <p>Everton could have few complaints. Not only have they won only one league game in 12, of the 14 points that now separate these clubs Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s side have donated six to the Stoke survival fund. There were boos from the travelling support at the end. \xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t have enough of a cutting edge,\xe2\x80\x9d Mart\xc3\xadnez admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cBut at least we get a proper rest now. We have just played five games in two weeks and it showed, but we still have 10 games to play and six of them are at Goodison.\xe2\x80\x9d That is 10 league games, of course.</p> <p>Everton\xe2\x80\x99s continued commitment to the Europa League, something Mart\xc3\xadnez would normally never question, is currently the elephant in the room.</p>'
