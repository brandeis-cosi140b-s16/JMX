b'John Terry: \xe2\x80\x98tippy-tappy football is great but you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to win the league\xe2\x80\x99'


b'<p>John Terry has pointed to Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s resilience and ability to dig deeper than those among the chasing pack as key to the team\xe2\x80\x99s imminent title success this season, arguing neat and tidy possession football is meaningless if it does not yield victories.</p> <p>The former England captain was outstanding in his side\xe2\x80\x99s goalless draw at Arsenal on Sunday, a result which means Chelsea can claim the title this week if they defeat Leicester on Wednesday and Crystal Palace at the weekend. The leaders have still only lost twice in the league all season, and not at all since New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, and boast a 10-point advantage at the top which they have maintained despite suspensions and injuries disrupting their approach over recent months.</p> <p>The disgruntled Arsenal fans had chanted \xe2\x80\x9cboring, boring Chelsea\xe2\x80\x9d as Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s derby petered out, with Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side maintaining their clean sheet having won their two previous matches, against Queens Park Rangers and Manchester United, despite conjuring only three shots on target. Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s side had monopolised the ball at Stamford Bridge only to succumb to a winner from Eden Hazard, who was duly crowned the Professional Footballers\xe2\x80\x99 Association player of the year on Sunday.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe are definitely not boring and if we do go on to win it, nobody\xe2\x80\x99s going to remember the performances when perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s not been that exciting,\xe2\x80\x9d said Terry. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve dug deep and other teams haven\xe2\x80\x99t, and that is why they are so far behind us. Possession is great. We could see that from the Manchester United game last week. Possession and tippy-tappy football\xe2\x80\x99s great, but if you are not winning games you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to win the league.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s approach has become more pragmatic, and \xe2\x80\x9cless artistic\xe2\x80\x9d according to the Portuguese, in the absence of Diego Costa and Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my, but they remain the second highest scorers in the division behind Manchester City. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s not forget the first half of the season, up until Christmas, when we were the best side by far,\xe2\x80\x9d said Terry. \xe2\x80\x9cThe football we played with [Cesc] F\xc3\xa0bregas and his assists, the goal at Burnley [from Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle] and others after that. The play was different class.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThings then went against us and the manager, being him, came up with the way to get us through games. That\xe2\x80\x99s where he\xe2\x80\x99s at his best. Let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget we were the best side up until Christmas for sure and we have actually beaten the teams who have made things difficult for us. Now we are one step from where we want to be. Leicester are flying, you can see they have got a bit of wind in their sails as well, so it is going to be a really tough game on Wednesday, but it is in our hands. Not anybody else\xe2\x80\x99s. We are grinding out results, we have got the quality in the squad, so hopefully we can get over the line because we are very close.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The manager had described Terry\xe2\x80\x99s performance in the goalless draw at the Emirates stadium as his \xe2\x80\x9cbest ever\xe2\x80\x9d, maintaining the 34-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s fine form this season. The centre-half is an ever present over the league campaign and has proved inspirational in a team that has not even trailed in a Premier League game since losing at White Hart Lane on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day. Terry, Gary Cahill and Branislav Ivanovic were all included in the PFA\xe2\x80\x99s team of the season, with the excellent C\xc3\xa9sar Azpilicueta unfortunate to miss out.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not too sure [it was my best display],\xe2\x80\x9d added Terry. \xe2\x80\x9cI got on the end of a lot of crosses and cleared a few. You can feel when things are going well and, definitely, during the game I felt it was. But to hear that from the likes of the manager, who stands there and assesses you day-in, day-out, is really nice. But I just have to keep on and keep going, because it can go the other way.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cArsenal are a really good side, especially going forward, so we needed to be on it defensively, which we have been collectively. I just thought, even in midfield, tracking back late on you could see they were a little shattered a little bit, but everyone dug deep. Defending is an art. I totally respect Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger [who had described defending as easy last week], he\xe2\x80\x99s a great manager. But, from our point of view, I am just delighted.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
