b'Fernando Torres could still return to Atl\xc3\xa9tico after permanent Milan move'


b'<p>Fernando Torres\xe2\x80\x99s Chelsea career is officially over after the Premier League leaders announced he is to make his loan move to Milan permanent in January.</p> <p>Torres, 30, won the Champions League, the Europa League and the FA Cup in three and a half years at Stamford Bridge, but never lived up to expectations after a \xc2\xa350m transfer from Liverpool, failing to replicate his once-prolific scoring record in the capital.</p> <p>He moved to Milan on a two-year loan in August and, while he has been strongly linked with a return to his first club Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid, on Saturday Chelsea announced a deal had been reached for him to move permanently from 5 January.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe striker moved to the San Siro on a two-year loan deal in August and on January 5 he will complete a permanent transfer to the Serie A side,\xe2\x80\x9d read a Chelsea statement. \xe2\x80\x9cChelsea Football Club thanks Fernando for his service during the past four seasons and wishes him the very best for the future.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The deal does not rule out a return to Atl\xc3\xa9tico in the upcoming transfer window however. The Spanish champions have indicated they do not have the funds for a permanent deal themselves, but may yet sign him on another loan deal from Milan once he has left Chelsea.</p> <p>On Saturday, before Torres\xe2\x80\x99s move to Milan was announced, the Atl\xc3\xa9tico assistant Germ\xc3\xa1n Burgos said the Spanish champions were close to tying up a deal for their former player.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt [the Torres deal] is on the verge of completion and we are waiting for things to firm up,\xe2\x80\x9d Burgos was quoted as saying in Spanish media.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe will be a very important reinforcement for the second half of the season. We will get the best out of him, the same as everyone, and he knows where he is coming to.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The same reports suggested that Atl\xc3\xa9tico\xe2\x80\x99s Italian winger Alessio Cerci would move to Milan on loan as part of the deal, which would run until the end of the 2015-16 season, but on Saturday he denied on his Facebook page that he had signed for another club.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI am an Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid player and together with the club I am considering the best solution for both,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that is right and normal.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
