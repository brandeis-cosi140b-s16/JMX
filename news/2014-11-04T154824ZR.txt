b'<p>Rio Ferdinand has decided not to appeal against the three-match ban and \xc2\xa325,000 fine handed to the Queens Park Rangers defender by the Football Association last week.</p> <p>The former England captain was sanctioned after using the word \xe2\x80\x9csket\xe2\x80\x9d, slang for a promiscuous woman, in a reply to a Twitter user on transfer deadline day.</p> <p>But despite appearing to label the FA\xe2\x80\x99s judgment as \xe2\x80\x9cludicrous\xe2\x80\x9d on Friday, Ferdinand has opted not to appeal because it is understood he feels he has no chance of overturning their decision. The governing body\xe2\x80\x99s disciplinary process has an almost perfect conviction rate in these cases.</p> <p>QPR received the written reasons behind the sanction on Monday evening but having studied them, it is understood both parties came to the conclusion any appeal would not be worthwhile. However, Ferdinand is thought to have expressed his disappointment at the composition of the three-man disciplinary panel, which he does not believe was properly representative.</p> <p>Ferdinand\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers had already written to the FA which stated it was their view he had no case to answer before their punishment was handed down. The defender, who has recently lost his place in the QPR team, has also been ordered to attend an education programme. The FA will publish the written reasons behind its sanction on Wednesday.</p> <p>This is the second time Ferdinand has been reprimanded by the FA for his use of Twitter after he appeared to endorse a description of Ashley Cole as a \xe2\x80\x9cchoc ice\xe2\x80\x9d in 2012.</p>'
