b'Which football-fan actors have appeared on screen in the colours of a rival? | The Knowledge'


b'<p>\xe2\x80\x9cRecently I have been enjoying the BBC\xe2\x80\x99s revival of the classic sitcom Open All Hours,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Stu Joslin last week. \xe2\x80\x9cIn this series, Barry Elliott (better known as the senior of the Chuckle Brothers) plays a customer called Mr Marshall, who dons a Doncaster Rovers jacket and scarf. Bearing in mind that it is well documented that the Chuckle Brothers are both in fact ardent Rotherham United fans, I was wondering if any other famous football fans have had to take to the stage or screen wearing the colours of a rival team for the sake of the part?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chuckle Sr is far from alone in portraying a supporter of a rival team in the name of thespianism. In The Fix Liverpool fan Ricky Tomlinson played an Everton supporter, while Liverpool fan Jason Isaacs played the Everton player Tony Kay. And Simon O\xe2\x80\x99Brien played keen Liverpool fan Damon Grant in Brookside, despite being an Evertonian.</p> <p>But perhaps most impressively Steve Burnham and Bill Markham write to point out that Everton chairman Bill Kenwright played a Liverpool fan in an episode of the Liver Birds:</p>            <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPhilip Glenister supports Arsenal but played Manchester City fan Gene Hunt in Life On Mars/Ashes To Ashes,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Marcos Garcia. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must have been especially confusing for him in the Life On Mars episode where he was playing the landlord of the pub full of Manchester United supporters \xe2\x80\x93 an Arsenal fan pretending to be a Man City fan pretending to be a Man United fan.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Also in the north-west: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s Only One Jimmy Grimble, the story of a teenage Man City fan in a school full of Man Utd fans, set around the peak of the gap between the two clubs\xe2\x80\x99 fortunes in the late 90s, starred diehard Reds fan Lewis McKenzie in the titular City fan role,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Darren Beach. The film also features West Ham fan Ray Winestone as a City fan.e</p> <p>The list goes on: West Ham fan Nick Frost donned a Bristol Rovers shirt in Hot Fuzz; Tottenham fan Neil Pearson played an Arsenal fan in Fever Pitch; West Ham man Danny Dyer plays a Chelsea fan in Football Factory; in Phoenix Nights Manchester United fan Justin Moorhouse wears a Manchester City shirt; in Rebus Hearts fan Ken Stott is Hibernian-supporting Detective Inspector Rebus; Spurs supporter Warren Mitchell played West Ham fan Alf Garnett in Till Death Us Do Part; Aston Villa fan Mark Williams donned a Birmingham City shirt for a series of sketches in The Fast Show.</p> <p>Finally a couple of players who have worn rivals\xe2\x80\x99 shirts. Firstly, Rangers legend Ally McCoist. \xe2\x80\x9cIn A Shot At Glory, the man affectionately known as \xe2\x80\x98Super\xe2\x80\x99 Ally plays the part of Jackie McQuillan, a legendary former Celtic striker brought back from the brink to sign for the fictional Kilnockie (bizarrely, and presumably to flog the film to an American audience, managed by Robert Duvall and owned by Michael Keaton),\xe2\x80\x9d writes Scott Coulter. \xe2\x80\x9cWith McQuillan spearheading the attack, Kilnockie embark on a memorable Scottish Cup run that culminates in a showdown at Hamden with McCoists own beloved Rangers. And, thanks to Andrew Docherty, here\xe2\x80\x99s the man himself.</p> <p>Last but certainly not least here\xe2\x80\x99s Nick Anstead: \xe2\x80\x9cI think actor might be stretching it, but this advert would seem to fit the bill \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p> HEADING FOR TROUBLE <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was a wee nipper playing football down the park with jumpers for goalposts it was customary when, having rounded the keeper with no other player nearby, to get down on one\xe2\x80\x99s hands and knees and knock the ball into the empty goal with one\xe2\x80\x99s head to further humiliate the opposition,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Brian Tunney. \xe2\x80\x9cHas anybody ever been so bold as to pull of this glorious move in a professional game?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Several cheeky chaps have attempted this playground favourite in the professional ranks. \xe2\x80\x9cOne John \xe2\x80\x98Leader\xe2\x80\x99 Ritchie did just that in a game for Stoke City against Southampton in the 1970s,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Matt Prince. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the pre-match build up Peter Osgood had opined that Ritchie wasn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly good with his head, a quite preposterous statement given that the man who remains Stoke City\xe2\x80\x99s all-time leading goal scorer, was simply sublime in the air.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cStoke won the game 4-1, with Ritchie scoring a hat-trick. For his third, and Stoke\xe2\x80\x99s fourth, Ritchie received the ball courtesy of a rebound off a post from a Jimmy Greenhoff shot, went past the stranded keeper and trapped the ball on the line; then, grinning from ear to ear he dropped to his knees, in front of the Boothen End, and nodded the ball over the line. Apparently, Osgood didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the funny side.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNathan Tyson scored a goal exactly like that for Wycombe Wanderers against Wrexham in September 2005,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Stu Joslin. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s alluded to in the match report here as \xe2\x80\x98a cheeky low range header\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>And, thanks to Richard House, here is Tyson\xe2\x80\x99s moment of glory:</p>            <p>Andy Clarke also got in on the act for Peterborough:</p>            <p>And here\xe2\x80\x99s Tolu Olorunmoteni: \xe2\x80\x9cPaul-Georges Ntep scored in this fashion against Reims in the 2013/14 season.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s a ballsy move for a 19-year-old:</p>            <p>But let the story of Mini Jakobsen be a warning. \xe2\x80\x9cJakobsen was a Norwegian player equally famous for his big mouth as his short legs, did something similar in a junior game, he explains in this article,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Guffen Helleve. \xe2\x80\x9cJakobsen\xe2\x80\x99s goals was cancelled by the referee, who found Jakobsen\xe2\x80\x99s actions to be bad sportsmanship.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> VAN MAN (UNITED) <p>\xe2\x80\x9cManchester United have used three \xe2\x80\x98Vans\xe2\x80\x99 during the Premier League era: Ruud Van Nistelrooy, Robin Van Persie and Louis Van Gaal,\xe2\x80\x9d begins Adam Morris. \xe2\x80\x9cHas any other clubs had more Vans than this? Can anyone name all of the Vans that have played in the Premier League since it started?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Well, the Van issue is of course the burning issue of the day so we could hardly ignore this question. In fact Manchester United have had four playing Vans in the Premier League era \xe2\x80\x93 the aforementioned Van Nistelrooy and Van Persie, but also Edwin van der Sar and Raimond van der Gouw \xe2\x80\x93 plus their current manager, making Old Trafford the undisputed king of the Vans. Tottenham, next in line to the throne, have had two \xe2\x80\x93 Pat van de Hauwe and Rafael van der Vaart \xe2\x80\x93 but no other team has had more than one.</p> <p>We think this is a comprehensive list: Raimond van der Gouw (Man Utd); Pierre van Hooijdonk (Nottingham Forest); Andy van der Meyde (Everton); Ruud van Nistelrooy (Man Utd); Robin van Persie (Arsenal, Man Utd); Edwin van der Sar (Fulham, Man Utd); Rafael van der Vaart (Tottenham); Daniel van Buyten (Man City); Jelle van Damme (Southampton, Wolves); Pat van den Hauwe (Tottenham), Ricky van Wolfswinkel (Norwich), Dennis van Wijk (Norwich).</p> <p>So now you know.</p> KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the most unusual place a match ball has been lost during a game (eg river, road)?\xe2\x80\x9d wondered Matthew Crocker back in the halcyon days of 2007.</p> <p>You might think a river an unusual place to lose a ball, Matthew, but in some parts of the world nothing could be more natural. Take Shrewsbury, for example, where the club\xe2\x80\x99s former home at Gay Meadow was situated right on the banks of the River Severn. They used to lose so many balls to the river that they even employed a local coracle maker - Fred Davies - to sit in one of his boats during matches and retrieve any that wound up in the water.</p> <p>But rivers are small fry - try playing right next to the sea like the Welsh team Holyhead Town. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember in the late 50s or 60s reading a short report of a match at Holyhead Town having to be abandoned because all the balls had been kicked out to sea,\xe2\x80\x9d offers Paul Crankshaw.</p> <p>What Paul can\xe2\x80\x99t tell us, however, is whether those balls were lost intentionally, as a number apparently were during the 1941 Rio State Championship final between Fluminense and Flamengo. \xe2\x80\x9cFluminense only needed a draw and went 2-0 up, but then Flamengo got level in the 83rd minute,\xe2\x80\x9d explains Guilherme Tanaka. \xe2\x80\x9cFluminense\xe2\x80\x99s players then took to hoofing balls into a nearby lake until they had run out altogether. The ruse nearly backfired as Flamengo\xe2\x80\x99s directors sent their rowing team to retrieve the balls, and a considerable amount of time was added on, but in the end Flamengo couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find another goal and Fluminense retained the title.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>You don\xe2\x80\x99t need water to lose a football though, as Paul Kilgour discovered at a pre-season friendly between Cardiff and Danish first division side Frem in Copenhagen. \xe2\x80\x9cAt one point the ball was hoofed up the pitch and over the goal,\xe2\x80\x9d recalls a misty-eyed Paul. \xe2\x80\x9cThe ball boy gave chase, but a dog got there first and chased the ball into the woods, never to be seen again.\xe2\x80\x9d Ah, the memories.</p> <p>For Tom Oxley, however, the strangest place a ball could possibly end up is ... York. His position becomes a bit more understandable when you realise the game was taking place in Kent. \xe2\x80\x9cOn a York City away day to Gravesend (now Ebbsfleet United) we arrived five minutes late for kick-off, and as we were running across the car park a ball came flying out of the stadium,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tom. \xe2\x80\x9cI managed to hide it under a traffic cone, collecting it after the game and taking it home, where it soon became the official match ball for the York City FC supporters\xe2\x80\x99 club, until someone blasted it on to the roof of Oaklands School, never to be retrieved. A twice lost ball, 250 miles from home.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive.</p> Can you help? <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMartin Canning is to be promoted to full-time manager after overseeing three defeats as caretaker manager at Hamilton Academicals,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Adam Harcus. \xe2\x80\x9cHas there been a caretaker manager out there with a worse record who still got the job?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy team, Aston Villa, have scored just 11 goals this season in 22 games but they also have 22 points from those games,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Conor Thompson. \xe2\x80\x9cHas any team ever posted a greater points-per-goal ratio?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Recently Chelsea conceded five goals in one match (5-3 defeat to Spurs) and then scored five goals in their next match (5-0 victory over Swansea). Has any team ever bettered this turnaround by conceding then scoring 6 or 7 etc?
