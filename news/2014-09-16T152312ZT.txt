b'The Fiver | Back with a bang'


b'BIG CUP IS BACK, BABY! <p>It might have been the late-night triple cheese toastie with extra mustard. Or it could have been the decision to give up the Tin and the microwave hotdog for dinner in a bid to try live healthy for a few days. Then again, it may be the fact that the Fiver is the wrong side of 30 and its only legacy is a hastily cobbled together email that is read by few and enjoyed by fewer. Whichever way, recently the Fiver has been having more nightmares and less sleep, and it needs an antidote quicker than Manchester United get out their chequebook.</p> <p>Of course, the Fiver is no stranger to such a situation and so off it went for the bottle of snoozy pills it keeps locked in a cabinet above the bathroom sink. Bad news there, though. A quick shake revealed it to be as empty as the space between Robin Thicke\xe2\x80\x99s ears. Palms sweaty and left eye twitching, your favourite tea-time email was about to cry for help until it realised, help was already at hand. Tonight\xe2\x80\x99s the night that Big Cup\xe2\x80\x99s group stage gets going. That should do just nicely, thanks very much. Sit down, feet up; TV on, conk out.</p> <p>Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s that time of year again. The time when the champions, the best, the great teams, the champions, come together for a great sporting event. And what a sporting event tonight promises to be, especially for England\xe2\x80\x99s finest. First up is a club that came as close to winning the league last year as the Fiver did to winning the Nobel Prize for Physics, who are taking on another club that came equally close to taking the title. Guess who? Yes that would be Bayern Munich Feeder FC versus Arsenal. Given that this is the umpteenth time in as many seasons that these two have met, this game should contain as many surprises as a romantic comedy starring Jennifer Aniston.</p> <p>But if the thought of watching that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get you hot under the collar, then the thought of watching a team that could not beat Aston Villa against a team the Fiver has never heard of almost certainly will. It\xe2\x80\x99s been five years since Liverpool were allowed to play with the big boys of Europe but they are back with a bang, playing a club who did not exist 14 years ago, whose home games cannot take place in their own stadium because it\xe2\x80\x99s in a worse state than the Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s fridge, whose annual budget is less than what Mario Balotelli spends when he\xe2\x80\x99s sent out to buy an ironing board and some starch. Oh the glory!</p> <p>Of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to point, laugh and say that Ludogorets\xe2\x80\x99 chances are akin to those of the girl in the Friday night horror movie, but at least they can puff out their chests and point out that they won a league last season, unlike the Fiver, or the rest of those Big Cup champions.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Jacob Steinberg from 7.45pm BST for MBM coverage of Borussia Dortmund 2-0 Arsenal, and Ian McCourt for Liverpool 2-1 Ludogorets.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI have never experienced anything like it. That is just primitive filth. I took one sip and realised that it was warm but thought that it was because of the sun. But by the second sip I realised that something was wrong\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 so very wrong. FC Muri goalkeeper Reto Felder considers taking legal action against the Baden fans who \xe2\x80\xa6 urinated in his water bottle during a recent Swiss first division game.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel. Subscribe today! And there\xe2\x80\x99s also a new app for iOS and Android.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSo Rio Ferdinand\xe2\x80\x99s book is called #2sides (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver) because \xe2\x80\x98there are #2sidestoeverystory and this #side is Ferdinand\xe2\x80\x99s #side\xe2\x80\x99. Surely he should have called it #1side in that case? Actually, given that it seems he has just slated various people throughout the book, maybe he should have just called it #Broadsides instead\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Daniel Rice.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: \xe2\x80\x98football tries to emulate Fifa 94 glitches\xe2\x80\x99 (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Bits and Bobs). Running away from the referee in Fifa 94 did not avoid a yellow card, but simply delayed it. In much the same way as winning at Hull doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean Alan Pardew will avoid the sack\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Brian Saxby.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver, you write the word \xe2\x80\x98t1tbits\xe2\x80\x99, quite obviously avoiding the \xe2\x80\x98i\xe2\x80\x99 so as to not have the Fiver be blocked from all sorts of mail blockers. The easier option was to use tidbits. That\xe2\x80\x99s my entry into the Fiver Pedants\xe2\x80\x99 League\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Nikhil Mahajan [entry revoked \xe2\x80\x93 Fiver Style Guide Ed].</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMumbai City in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver!

Where from is anyone\xe2\x80\x99s guess, mind.</p>            BITS AND BOBS <p>Former Germany goalkeeper Tim Wiese has revealed he is considering an offer to become a professional wrestler with the WWE. \xe2\x80\x9cI will listen. I don\xe2\x80\x99t sh1t my pants,\xe2\x80\x9d he slobber-knockered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should I immediately say no? I will go through the enquiry with my agent next week.\xe2\x80\x9d Oh my God in heaven.</p> <p>Nottingham has beaten off (leave it \xe2\x80\x93 you\xe2\x80\x99re better than that) Manchester and Portsmouth to be named Sport England\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98City of Football\xe2\x80\x99, a \xc2\xa31.6m project aimed at getting more people playing the game regularly. And if the city can go on producing footballers as talented as Jermaine Pennant, Jermaine Jenas and Leon Best, then it will be money well spent.</p> <p>Eden Hazard might struggle to run as fast as he usually does in future because of the massive amounts of cash weighing his pockets down. The Belgian playmaker is set to sign a new contract worth a tidy \xc2\xa3200,000-a-week at Stamford Bridge, making him the club\xe2\x80\x99s highest paid player. \xe2\x80\x9cOne more month, one less month, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a new contract,\xe2\x80\x9d cha-chinged Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho, saucily playing with the concept of time.</p> <p>QPR\xe2\x80\x99s plans to build a shiny new 40,000-seater stadium might be scuppered, because they apparently haven\xe2\x80\x99t asked the people who own the ground they wish to build it on. Bit of an oversight, that. \xe2\x80\x9cThe company are not in negotiations with QPR and will not enter into any future talks with the club,\xe2\x80\x9d pooh-poohed Tony Mendes, managing director of Cargiant.</p> <p>In \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, we\xe2\x80\x99re in safe hands\xe2\x80\x99 news, a member of the watchdog meant to be keeping an eye on Fifa\xe2\x80\x99s finances has been arrested on suspicion of corruption and money-laundering. Canover Watson has been relieved of his duties while the accusations are investigated.</p> <p>Elsewhere at the big Fifa house, the deliciously-named J\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xb4me Champagne has called in the interior decorators and started measuring up the windows in Sepp Blatter\xe2\x80\x99s office, after announcing that he is set to launch a fearless challenge for the old man\xe2\x80\x99s crown when the presidential \xe2\x80\x98election\xe2\x80\x99 comes around next year.</p> <p>Barcelona have named a pitch at their training ground after former manager Tito Vilanova, who died earlier this year.</p> <p>And Marco van Basten has been forced to step down as AZ Alkmaar head coach as the job was \xe2\x80\x9cmore and more often causing me physical and mental problems\xe2\x80\x9d, although he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to work at the club as a special assistant to his successor. Get better soon, Marco.</p> WIN! WIN!
