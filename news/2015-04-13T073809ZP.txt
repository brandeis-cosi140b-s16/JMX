b'Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend\xe2\x80\x99s action'


b'1) Young for England? <p>Ashley Young\xe2\x80\x99s last game for England came in September 2013 as a 67th-minute substitute in the goalless World Cup qualifier in Ukraine best remembered for Roy Hodgson praising the \xe2\x80\x9cvery high quality\xe2\x80\x9d of the game and barely even trying to conceal his rage when he was informed that Gary Lineker had described it as \xe2\x80\x9cawful.\xe2\x80\x9d Since then, Young has dropped out of Hodgson\xe2\x80\x99s thinking without anyone really quibbling with the decision or campaigning on the player\xe2\x80\x99s behalf. Young\xe2\x80\x99s form had not only deteriorated to the point where he was in danger of becoming the player Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s supporters liked the least, he had also saddled himself with a reputation as one of the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s more prolific divers. And a player who tries to win penalties with acts of cheating \xe2\x80\x93 for that is what it is \xe2\x80\x93 cannot expect a great deal of sympathy when his form slumps and other players are brought in to take his place.</p> <p>To see Young excelling as part of United\xe2\x80\x99s gradual renaissance, culminating in the former Aston Villa player being the outstanding performer in the 4-2 defeat of Manchester City, is therefore one of the more unexpected success stories at Old Trafford this season, especially as it means him keeping the most expensive player in English football, \xc3\x81ngel Di Mar\xc3\xada, out of the team. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was fantastic,\xe2\x80\x9d his manager, Louis van Gaal, said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was our best player. I am very happy for him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Can he revive his England career? Roy Hodgson was at Old Trafford on Sunday and Young\xe2\x80\x99s chances must have been significantly improved by his contribution, including the equalising goal as well as the crosses for Marouane Fellaini and Chris Smalling to score. His diving appears to have been curtailed and if he can maintain this level of performance nobody should be too surprised if he comes into Hodgson\xe2\x80\x99s plans for England\xe2\x80\x99s two games in June: the friendly against Republic of Ireland in Dublin and then the Euro 2016 qualifier in Slovenia.</p> <p>Young, with 30 caps, turns 30 the following month, which is usually the age when insecurity appears in a footballer\xe2\x80\x99s mind. In his case, the future is looking considerably brighter than anyone could possibly have anticipated at the start of the season.

They are in a battle to qualify for the Europa League now. Yet there is a suspicion that they would not be too worried if they miss out. Nothing against the Europa League, a fine and exciting competition when it gets going, but Tottenham have been looking leggy in recent weeks. The Thursday-Sunday grind has taken a toll on their squad and for a club whose ultimate ambition is to reach the Champions League, it might not be the end of the world if their Thursday nights are a bit freer next season. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not easy,\xe2\x80\x9d Pochettino said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you are a young squad and you make the biggest effort during the season maybe you arrive, not physically, but mentally in a very difficult moment at the end of the season.\xe2\x80\x9d Jacob Steinberg</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Tottenham Hotspur 0-1 Aston Villa\xe2\x80\xa2 Sherwood thanks Spurs for chance to manage after Villa win</p>  3) Ospina is Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s unsung hero <p>He is South American, enjoyed a fine World Cup, joined Arsenal in the summer and has played a major part in their success this season. It is Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez, but not just him. Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s record with David Ospina in goal is extraordinary. He has played 12 league games and Arsenal have emerged victorious in 11 of them. If that 92% win rate will prove unsustainable in the long term, the Colombian has certainly justified Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s decision to promote him ahead of Wojciech Szczesny. Ospina didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much to do in the 1-0 win at Turf Moor on Saturday but when he was required, he showed the sort of conviction that gives defenders confidence in their goalkeeper. An early block from Sam Vokes prevented Burnley from taking the lead. Kieran Trippier\xe2\x80\x99s free-kick was repelled. Ospina\xe2\x80\x99s performance illustrated why Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s defending has become more authoritative of late. For years, when Szczesny, Lukasz Fabianski and Manuel Almunia were selected, there have been suggestions Arsenal need a new goalkeeper. Now perhaps they don\xe2\x80\x99t.

Some of the post-match focus, after the streaky 1-0 win at Queens Park Rangers, was on the goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois, by dint of his match-changing save from Matt Phillips. Mourinho said with a smile that he had told Courtois that he owed him a couple of points, after his error at Hull City and how he had been beaten from 66 yards by Stoke City\xe2\x80\x99s Charlie Adam. Yet Mourinho wanted to highlight somebody else \xe2\x80\x93 the back-up goalkeeper, Petr Cech. \xe2\x80\x9cCech\xe2\x80\x99s attitude is amazing,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore the game, he was telling the captain to choose a certain end, if he won the toss because, at 1.30pm, a certain goal is better to play in because of the sun. He was not playing but he was thinking of Courtois.\xe2\x80\x9d David Hytner</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: QPR 0-1 Chelsea\xe2\x80\xa2 Costa out for Chelsea until May at earliest, says Mourinho\xe2\x80\xa2 Chelsea make \xc2\xa34m bid to sign Japan forward Muto in summer\xe2\x80\xa2 QPR\xe2\x80\x99s Phillips: from forgotten man to assist-maker extraordinaire</p>  5) Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s tactical acumen enabled Bolasie to terrorise Sunderland <p>Alan Pardew showed off his true managerial ability while exacting brutal revenge on Sunderland for the four straight defeats he suffered against the Wearsiders as Newcastle United manager. Granted it helped Palace\xe2\x80\x99s cause that Lee Cattermole picked up a silly first-half booking for pulling back Yannick Bolasie and thereafter needed to watch his step. Yet if Pardew must have been delighted to see Dick Advocaat subsequently replace an alarmingly frustrated Cattermole \xe2\x80\x93 Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s key player \xe2\x80\x93 with Liam Bridcutt, his tactics already looked near perfect. With Palace\xe2\x80\x99s defence cleverly isolating Jermain Defoe, their pace enabled them to persistently undo Sunderland on the counterattack, with the excellent Bolasie \xe2\x80\x93 the scorer of a fabulous hat-trick \xe2\x80\x93 in particular constantly pulling Advocaat\xe2\x80\x99s backline out of shape courtesy of his intelligent movement. Even so Patrick Van Aanholt had been doing well for Sunderland in the first half. Spotting this problem, Pardew clearly instructed Wilfried Zaha to make life difficult for the home left-back after the interval and such advice appeared to work a treat. Van Aanholt is the only Sunderland defender blessed with speed but, under increasing pressure, he was no longer available to help out the less-than-pace-suffused John O\xe2\x80\x99Shea and Santiago Vergini. Palace\xe2\x80\x99s ruthlessly efficient targeting of that pair soon saw them fall apart in the face of Bolasie and company as their manager\xe2\x80\x99s game plan paid increasing dividends. Certainly the near anonymous Jack Rodwell and Jordi G\xc3\xb3mez found themselves thoroughly out-manoeuvred by much intelligent central midfield pressing on the part of James McArthur and Mile Jedinak. Pardew is rarely shy about talking about himself up but when he claimed the 1-4 scoreline flattered Sunderland he was not exaggerating.

Saido Berahino was given No9, Astle\xe2\x80\x99s number, by Tony Pulis as a reward for the young striker\xe2\x80\x99s impressive run of form. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has been so good for us this season and we had a little chat beforehand about it,\xe2\x80\x9d the manager said. Few could dispute it was a nice touch but why Darren Fletcher wore No11 in centre midfield was anybody\xe2\x80\x99s guess. Alan Smith</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: West Brom 2-3 Leicester City</p>  7) Has Hull\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnew assistant manager bounce\xe2\x80\x9d worn off?  <p>After Steve Bruce hired Mike Phelan to help him in early February, Hull drew with Manchester City and then beat Aston Villa and Queens Park Rangers. It looked like they were heading in the right direction. But they have not won a match since then and are now deep in peril with fearsome assignments ahead. Of all the teams still threatened by relegation, Hull have the most daunting set of fixtures, with four of their six remaining matches against teams in the top seven. They have yet to beat a team in the top half this season. Goalkeeper Steve Harper, who started against Southampton as one of several changes made by a management team desperately seeking solutions, believes the Phelangood factor is still strong. \xe2\x80\x9cThe training has been good and since Mike has come in, the tempo has gone up and been good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harper. \xe2\x80\x9cWork has been put in on the training ground, credit to the gaffer, Mike and the staff, we went back to a four [in defence, against Southampton] which gave us a better attacking threat. We just need to start taking the chances that we create.\xe2\x80\x9d Bruce reckons that two, or maybe three, victories will see his team to safety, but can they get that many from matches against Crystal Palace, Liverpool, Arsenal, Burnley, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United? Paul Doyle</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Southampton 2-0 Hull City </p>  8) Cork could provide the fizz at base of England\xe2\x80\x99s midfield diamond  <p>Garry Monk has done impressive business in his two transfer windows as Swansea manager, but Jack Cork is shaping up to be his most stellar acquisition. Since Cork\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa33m arrival from Southampton, Monk has been able to shift Swansea from their familiar 4-2-3-1 set-up to a midfield diamond with minimum disruption. Cork sits at the base of that diamond, offering an effective shield for his back four, breaking up play and distributing effectively. The 25-year-old is not flash but he is already an integral element at Swansea. With England well on course to qualify for Euro 2016, surely Roy Hodgson could do worse than assess Cork\xe2\x80\x99s credentials before the finals come round.

Photograph: Rebecca Naden/Reuters    9) West Ham should stick with Allardyce, for one more year <p>The West Ham manager, Sam Allardyce, may have described Marko Arnautovic\xe2\x80\x99s injury-time equaliser as \xe2\x80\x9cthe ultimate blow\xe2\x80\x9d, but the soon-to-be-out-of-contract 60-year-old knows he is already on the ropes in east London and before the match spoke to the press as though he was a dead-man walking. Rafa Ben\xc3\xadtez, also out of contract at Napoli where he has just rejected a three-year extension, was reportedly spotted at the club\xe2\x80\x99s training ground last week, along with former Everton and Manchester United (and current part-time Derby County) coach Steve Round, and the Spaniard now looks certain to land the job. However encouraging this campaign may have been, West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s first priority next season will be to ensure that they are a Premier League club when they make the move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016. However accomplished his CV is, appointing Ben\xc3\xadtez would be a gamble. West Ham are a club with well-known long-term aspirations but until they get to Stratford, they might be better placed to play it safe and stick with Allardyce in the short-term, if only for one more year. Allardyce has been cast aside before, most notably when he was foolishly sacked by Blackburn Rovers in 2010. It proved to be a poor decision. Michael Butler</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: West Ham 1-1 Stoke City \xe2\x80\xa2 Allardyce says he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know if he\xe2\x80\x99ll be at West Ham next season</p>  10) Benteke revival proof Sherwood\xe2\x80\x99s simple psychology works <p>If he decides the heat of Premier League management is too much or his win ratios start to slip, Tim Sherwood could set up some sort of consultancy business reinvigorating the careers of struggling wayward, but ultimately talented, strikers. Last season at Spurs he brought Emmanuel Adebayor in from an Andr\xc3\xa9 Villas-Boas decreed exile and the forward bagged 14 goals in the second half of the campaign, and now Christian Benteke, who before Sherwood\xe2\x80\x99s arrival had scored just three goals in 18 appearances, but since his record is now eight in nine. Benteke\xe2\x80\x99s revival could also be down to a general improvement in Villa\xe2\x80\x99s form, which of course couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get much worse than under the desperate Paul Lambert, while he spent the early weeks of the season recovering from injury, but there\xe2\x80\x99s something else too, and the Belgian looks revitalised. Sherwood\xe2\x80\x99s approach with Adebayor was to make him \xe2\x80\x9cfeel like he was the main man\xe2\x80\x9d, while it\xe2\x80\x99s been similar with Benteke. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had chats with him, told him what I think of him, and how everyone in Europe seemed to want him a year ago, and that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just vanish,\xe2\x80\x9d Sherwood said on Saturday. It is, of course, easy to be sniffy about Sherwood and his methods because they appear to be quite simplistic, but why over-complicate matters? This relatively basic psychology and man-management clearly works \xe2\x80\x93 for how long remains to be seen, but at the moment Benteke, with Sherwood\xe2\x80\x99s help, looks as if he\xe2\x80\x99s firing his club to safety.
