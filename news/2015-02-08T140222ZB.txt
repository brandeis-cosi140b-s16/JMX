b'Burnley v West Bromwich Albion: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0as it happened | Michael Butler'


b'<p>If Burnley are relegated this season, people will point to this result as a big reason why. This is definitely two points dropped and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get any easier for them: they travel to Manchester United and Chelsea for their next two games. </p> <p>The home side were absolutely dominant throughout, but were undone by sloppy defending at two corners. West Brom hardly threatening otherwise, although they remarkably could have won it as Berahino spurned a glorious chance late on with a close-range shot which was well saved by a combination of Heaton and Mee. </p> <p>Burnley climb out of the relegation zone, now one point ahead of Hull, but they miss the chance to leapfrog West Brom. Thanks for your emails and tweets, this was fun. See you next time. Bye!</p>     Who da man? You da man Brown Ideye. Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images  '
