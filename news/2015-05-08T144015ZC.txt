The visitors\xe2\x80\x99 captain will hardly care, and there is likely to be a show of respect from Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho for a player he has always admired. Chelsea should be rested after four days off. Liverpool, clinging to faint hopes of a top-four finish, must become the first visiting team to triumph here this season.
