b'Raheem Sterling: how many clubs actually want to sign him?'


b'Liverpool  <p>Liverpool have Sterling under contract until 2017 and showed they will not be coerced into a sale during the stand-off with Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez in 2013, although there is a marked contrast in the players\xe2\x80\x99 importance to the team and future transfer value. Brendan Rodgers is adamant Sterling is staying put. An inflated fee for potential, however, would surely tempt a rethink. Andy Hunter </p> <p>Likelihood: 6/10 </p> Manchester City <p>They would love to sign Raheem Sterling and can afford to pay him more than \xc2\xa3100,000 if this will seal the deal. There would be no surprise if the club offered, say, a basic of \xc2\xa3120,000 that could rise to \xc2\xa3150,000 with incentives. On the football front: a fast, game-intelligent bright young thing who carries a goal threat is a total no-brainer for a City squad that requires freshening up. Will Liverpool sell to a rival though? Jamie Jackson</p> <p>Likelihood: 7/10</p> Manchester United  <p>Louis van Gaal has Memphis Depay incoming this close season in the category of young, rapid winger. Yet the manager loves callow potential he can mould and harness so would seriously consider buying a footballer who can play across the frontline and who alongside Depay and Wayne Rooney would form a three-man attack in the manager\xe2\x80\x99s favoured 4-3-3 that would terrify most opposition. United, soon to be flush from the \xc2\xa3750m, 10-year Adidas kit deal that starts on 1 August, could afford to pay Sterling, and would countenance doing so, a basic of around \xc2\xa3140,000 a week. But a sale to Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s fiercest rivals would be an eye-opener, to say the least? JJ</p> <p>Likelihood: 3/10</p> Chelsea <p>The club could afford Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s wage demands, and the mooted \xc2\xa340-50m fee would be in their scope. The fact the winger is homegrown is a bonus and as a provider of genuine width, they would be attracted to the possibility of bringing him back to west London on plenty of levels. He is an option they would consider and their main scout has been at Anfield several times this season. But would he constitute a priority when they have Willian, the underused Juan Cuadrado and youngsters such as Isaiah Brown waiting in the wings? Dominic Fifield</p> <p>Likelihood: 6/10</p> Arsenal <p>At the end of March, when Arsenal were made aware of Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s situation at Liverpool, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger, Dick Law and Steve Rowley privately made it plain that they would not be interested in him in the summer. The club want to tie Theo Walcott to a new contract. And they are hardly short of wingers and No10s. But things can change very quickly in football. Sterling would represent an upgrade on Walcott. David Hytner</p> <p>Likelihood: 5/10</p> Bayern Munich <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that Sterling is on Bayern\xe2\x80\x99s radar \xe2\x80\x93 they\xe2\x80\x99re looking for precisely that sort of player, and pacy wingers of his calibre are in short supply \xe2\x80\x93 but whether they\xe2\x80\x99d be willing to pay a 20-year-old the kind of wages that would elevate him above stalwarts like Thomas M\xc3\xbcller and Manuel Neuer is a very different matter. Raphael Honigstein</p> <p>Likelihood: 4/10</p> Paris Saint-Germain <p>A young, very talented forward who is (kind of) on the market: Sterling ticks all the boxes for PSG. The Parisian club are on the lookout for this type of player this summer. They were very close to signing Memphis Depay and Sterling follows the same logic. They have been monitoring his contractual situation for a while now. Money would not be a problem even with Sterling wage\xe2\x80\x99s demands (just think that \xc2\xa3100,000 a week is only slightly more than what Yohan Cabaye earns at the Parc des Princes). He is not Paris\xe2\x80\x99s No1 priority (that is Angel Di Mar\xc3\xada) but he is definitely on their radar. Julien Laurens</p> <p>Likelihood: 7/10</p> Barcelona <p>FC Barcelona cannot sign because of a Fifa ban. What they can do is bring back on loan players such as Gerard Deulofeu and Denis Su\xc3\xa1rez, creative talents who would add to a forward line that, last time anyone looked, was quite tasty anyway. Leo Messi, Neymar and Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez have 115 goals between them this season. So, do Barcelona need Sterling? What do you reckon? Sid Lowe</p> <p>Likelihood: 1/10</p> Real Madrid <p>Summer time is signings time at the Santiago Bernab\xc3\xa9u and all the more so after a season without a major trophy. David De Gea should come but few at Real Madrid have shown any sign yet of seeing Sterling as a superstar. Make enough noise now, though, and they might. Or, realistically, they might not.</p> <p>Likelihood: 3/10</p> Internazionale <p>Despite posting losses of more than \xe2\x82\xac100m on their 2014 accounts, Inter remain determined to strengthen this summer. Attack, though, is not the priority. If the club are to offer big wages for any one player it is likely to be Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9, of whom Roberto Mancini remains a big admirer. Paolo Bandini</p> <p>Likelihood: 1/10</p> Milan <p>It remains possible that Silvio Berlusconi will sell Milan in the coming weeks \xe2\x80\x93 in which case a new owner might seek a statement signing. As things stand, though, the former prime minister remains at the helm, and says he wants his team rebuilt around a core of Italian players. PB</p> <p>Likelihood: 1/10</p> Juventus <p>After a Champions League run that has earned them more than \xe2\x82\xac100m, Juventus have the means to spend but already grabbed one young forward in Paulo Dybala and have no immediate need for another. Furthermore, not even the club\xe2\x80\x99s highest earners \xe2\x80\x93 Carlos Tevez and Paul Pogba \xe2\x80\x93 are paid as much as Sterling is reportedly seeking.
