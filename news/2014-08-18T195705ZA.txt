b'Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger warns of fatigue before Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s difficult Besiktas test'


b'<p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger has warned his Arsenal players they face a stern test of character in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s awkward Champions League qualifier against Besiktas. He admitted his team are \xe2\x80\x9cshort of preparation\xe2\x80\x9d, not to mention their daunting trip to Everton to follow on .</p> <p>The Londoners will have Laurent Koscielny available for the game at the Ataturk stadium, where Besiktas are playing while their new stadium is being built, after he recovered from an achilles problem as the visitors seek to reach the group stage for the 15th successive season. Arsenal laboured in defeating Crystal Palace at the Emirates on Saturday, needing a last-minute winner from Aaron Ramsey, in their opening Premier League fixture and Wenger already is concerned at his side\xe2\x80\x99s prospects of recovering from the draining trip to Istanbul in time for Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game at Goodison Park and back .</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a big test,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wenger when asked what awaits against Besiktas. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had a short preparation and we know that in one week we have three big games: Besiktas home and away and Everton in between. Every challenge is different and beating a Turkish team away from home is very difficult but we want to perform at our best. Besiktas are on the back of a good result against Feyenoord [in the third qualifying round] but we\xe2\x80\x99re on our toes and want to produce a good result.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Progress would be worth around \xc2\xa320m to Arsenal, who have won all 12 of their previous qualifying games to reach the Champions League group stage. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very important game, for the club and for everyone,\xe2\x80\x9d said the midfielder, Mathieu Flamini, who has recovered from illness and should feature. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to give everything and make sure we qualify. We know it won\xe2\x80\x99t be an easy game and we respect Besiktas. But we\xe2\x80\x99re ready for these big games and ready to go through.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Slaven Bilic\xe2\x80\x99s Besiktas are much improved, and bolstered by the signing of Demba Ba from Chelsea, as they attempt to reach the group stage for the first time in five years. The former Croatia manager admitted his side were up against \xe2\x80\x9cone of the strongest teams in Europe\xe2\x80\x9d but said they had a game plan which could see them prevail. He will be heartened by the fact that they have won their last 12 games in Uefa qualifying as they attempt to eke out a lead to take into next week\xe2\x80\x99s return at the Emirates stadium.</p> <p>Wenger, for his part, remains wary of the threat that awaits at a half-full Ataturk stadium. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x9cI have a good experience in the Champions League,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cI know you have to be pragmatic and realistic and just go game by game. First we have to qualify. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very difficult task and we know we have two difficult games. Before speaking about anything else we know we have to put in two big performances against Besiktas.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
