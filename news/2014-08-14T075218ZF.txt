b'Football transfer rumours: Danny Welbeck to Hull?'


b'<p>There are 104.6 miles between Old Trafford and the KC Stadium. In current traffic, you can make it between the two in an hour and 59 minutes (real-time updates for your commute from the Mill, and probably the most accurate thing you\xe2\x80\x99ll read in our oeuvre), and it is a curiously well-beaten path. The Tigers already count four United alumni among their number, manager Steve Bruce included, and several more have passed through during the last half-decade\xe2\x80\x99s assiduous combing of Red Devil cast-offs.</p> <p>But with apologies to Robbie Brady, James Chester and Paul McShane, the biggest deal yet is apparently plotting that schlep across the Pennines. Danny Welbeck \xe2\x80\x93 yes Welbz himself \xe2\x80\x93 is the man Hull want to perk up an attack that might soon be losing Shane Long to Southampton, with Brucie hoping a carrot of \xc2\xa314m might entice Louis van Gaal into expediting the much-mooted exodus from M16 that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really happened yet. Goals have been hard to come by for Welbeck this year \xe2\x80\x93 just the two since 1 January \xe2\x80\x93 but that didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop Bruce from signing Nikica Jelavic and it seems fairly clear that the striker, 24 in November, would fancy strutting his stuff up top each week rather than being shunted out wide to do an Intriguing Tactical Job. So, eyes open for an England forward putting a cross-country shift in sometime soon.</p> <p>And if Welbz doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fancy it? Watford captain Troy Deeney, whose inhabiting of a glorious constantly-linked-but-never-moving space is our very raison d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xaatre, is also under the Hull supremo\xe2\x80\x99s scrutiny.</p> <p>Perhaps unlike Welbeck, we\xe2\x80\x99ll stay in Manchester. The Arturo Vidal saga, such as it is, could be over soon \xe2\x80\x93 with suggestions that he could finally pitch up at United with Javier Hern\xc3\xa1ndez lined up in part-exchange. Pinches of salt all round, as per.</p> <p>The trail from Amsterdam to London is similarly log-jammed to the M62 at the best of times and, for different reasons, often equally unmemorable. Kolbeinn Sigthorsson\xe2\x80\x99s lucidity may well be questioned if he seals a move from Ajax to QPR, but the Icelandic front man\xe2\x80\x99s switch looks closer after a hitch involving personal terms was negotiated.</p> <p>Nervous glances, meanwhile, at nearby Stamford Bridge, where Chelsea will have to shift another of their foreign players in order to comply with rules regarding Premier League and Champions League squads. Who could it be? Petr Cech, Marco van Ginkel, Mikel John Obi and Fernando Torres may all be wary of finding a horse\xe2\x80\x99s head in their locker between now and the end of the month if they sit too comfortably.</p> <p>Arsenal seem fairly relaxed about their attacking options now that Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez is in the fold and Yaya Sanogo is battering them past Benfica. They\xe2\x80\x99re willing to let young German winger Serge Gnabry, who scored at Swansea in last season\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League, head out on loan for some more sustained top-level experience \xe2\x80\x93 with Aston Villa among those keen for their own infusion of Teutonic excellence.</p> <p>With a section of Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s squad seemingly having decided the intensity and passion of the Qatari league is more their thing than the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s barren, sterile eeriness, Garry Monk has a vacancy or two to fill \xe2\x80\x93 particularly at centre-back. No matter, because Argentinian centre-back Federico Fern\xc3\xa1ndez is on his way from Napoli, from whose Champions League squad he has been omitted, and should sign for around \xc2\xa37m by the end of the week.</p> <p>Finally, relief at Newcastle \xe2\x80\x93 where Tim Krul has skilfully knocked down a straw man by confiding in team-mates he is happy to stay at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park after being impressed by the signings of countrymen Siem de Jong and Daryl Janmaat. And there we were thinking footballers only conversed about cars, women and fast living.</p>'
