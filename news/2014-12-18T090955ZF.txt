b'Football transfer rumours: Wesley Sneijder to join Southampton?'


b'<p>The incredible rags to riches story at Manchester United rolls on, with news emerging that the Old Trafford paupers, who showed such incredible strength of character, calm and togetherness when they had around two seconds of being rubbish earlier this year, have stumbled across a bit of cash and would like to spend \xc2\xa347m on Borussia Dortmund\xe2\x80\x99s Mats Hummels. Aw, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they just adorable? It makes you want to tap-dance all the way to work.</p> <p>Harry Redknapp has been racking his brains for strikers that Queens Park Rangers can sign for his meeting with Tony Fernandes today, but can\xe2\x80\x99t stop thinking about Peter Crouch and Jermain Defoe. It\xe2\x80\x99s understandable, it\xe2\x80\x99s like how the Mill can\xe2\x80\x99t stop thinking of anything that\xe2\x80\x99s not funny.</p> <p>Ashley Cole\xe2\x80\x99s agent presumably reckons it\xe2\x80\x99s a disgrace that his client, who\xe2\x80\x99s currently tearing it up at Roma \xe2\x80\x93 probably, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t checked \xe2\x80\x93 is being linked with Crystal Palace. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a disgrace,\xe2\x80\x9d Ashley Cole\xe2\x80\x99s agent is presumably quoted as saying. The Palace Ultras won\xe2\x80\x99t like this one bit.</p> <p>Eden Hazard is going to sign a new deal that will make him Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s biggest earner. How nice for him.</p> <p>Andr\xc3\xa9 Villas-Boas says there\xe2\x80\x99s no chance he\xe2\x80\x99ll be heading to Liverpool or, in fact, that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be working in the Premier League any time soon. That\xe2\x80\x99s probably not the setback he thinks it is.</p> <p>Also not heading to Liverpool: Xherdan Shaqiri. The Bayern Munich winger is set for Wolfsburg instead.</p> <p>Southampton are done now, finished, old hat, yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s news. Which makes them and Wesley Sneijder a match made in heaven. Ronald Koeman, who is basically finished as a manager now, wants to sign the Galatasaray schemer. He\xe2\x80\x99ll have to hurry, though, the bulldozers will be circling St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s soon.</p> <p>And Radamel Falcao would like to stay at United when his loan spell from Monaco ends. Oh well, the Mill would like to write something funny before the year\xe2\x80\x99s out, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not happening either.</p>'
