b'Acclaimed portrayal of an Ivorian Frank Spencer | The Fiver'


b'<p>TOUR\xc3\x89 DE FORCE</p> <p>Blackeye Rovers medics have devised a special fitness test for Rudy Gestede before tonight\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup replay against Liverpool at Ewood Park. The hulking striker has a tight hamstring and the pre-match workout will consist of him being asked to scrunch his face into a scowl and shout \xe2\x80\x9cboo!\xe2\x80\x9d very loudly while team-mates scurry hither and thither in his vicinity. If he can do that, he\xe2\x80\x99s more than ready to scare the bejaysus out of a Liverpool defence so jittery that they get motion sickness just walking out on to the pitch.</p> <p>Suspensions for Martin Skrtel and Emre Can mean that Kolo Tour\xc3\xa9 is set for action again, hot off his acclaimed portrayal of an Ivorian Frank Spencer during Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s 90-minute skit at the Emirates. Dejan Lovren could also start despite doubts about his fitness, his confidence having taken a fearful bloody shoeing by dint of him being declared unworthy to be cast ahead of the troupe that put on that show at Arsenal. In a bid to soothe Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s nerves, Brendan Rodgers may also bring in Glen Johnson, whose exemplary calmness under pressure should never be confused with just not giving a damn.</p> <p>Even better, Simon Mignolet has declared that he will continue inspiring confidence in Tour\xc3\xa9 the way he did on Saturday. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore the game [against Arsenal], Kolo reminded me that I had to keep him on his toes with it being his first game for a while,\xe2\x80\x9d hurrahed the goalkeeper, as an interjection from Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez flew straight over his head. \xe2\x80\x9cOrganising the defence is something that is very important and I try to do my best every single day in training to make sure the lads get the information they need,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Mignolet, as Mesut \xc3\x96zil offered him some information that he completely failed to grasp.</p> <p>Rodgers is desperate to get his selection right tonight in order to salvage something shiny from a glum campaign. \xe2\x80\x9cThe FA Cup would certainly give us a great boost as a team, with lots of young players and players coming into the club,\xe2\x80\x9d trumpeted Rodgers, whose contribution to the Anfield trophy cabinet since taking charge nearly three years ago has consisted of hiring nimble technicians to give it an occasional scrub. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was the key thing for me, to get the group challenging at the top end of the league and for trophies,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Rodgers, who took over at a time when the club was in the throes of a trophy drought that had been going on for nearly four months.</p> <p>The Rovers manager Gary Bowyer reckons that his own side\xe2\x80\x99s knack bother means Liverpool have a great opportunity. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have so few players we will be wondering about having to play the kitman, who has a dodgy knee,\xe2\x80\x9d quipped Bowyer, possibly as Rodgers pondered putting in a transfer bid.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Paul Doyle from 7.45pm BST for MBM coverage of Blackeye Rovers 0-2 Liverpool in their FA Cup quarter-final replay, before Jacob Steinberg saddles up at 9pm BST for Rayo Vallecano 1-3 Real Madrid in La Liga.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was in Harrods with my wife and my son for some shopping and I forgot to pay [for] a honey jar and some sliced meats we had previously ordered. While exiting the shop unaware of my oversight, I was stopped by security guards which then called the police as a standard routine procedure. As I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t carrying with me any identity documents at the time, I was asked to go to the nearest police station in order to be identified after which I left and went back home. Hence, I have now instructed my lawyers to protect my image with all necessary legal actions against those who reported this inaccurate and tendentious news\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Leyton Orient\xe2\x80\x99s Andrea Dossena issues a statement via his Mr 15% after he and his wife were arrested by police on Tuesday afternoon.</p>      REBOUND OF THE DAY <p>5 April: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is an opportunity we would be foolish to ignore. This summer is our chance to reflect, refresh and rebuild\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Torquay boss Chris Hargreaves on the club bringing in Paul Sturrock to work alongside him.</p> <p>8 April: \xe2\x80\x9cSadly the involvement of Paul Sturrock as an advisor at Torquay United has come to an end after [he] was offered a permanent contract at another club\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 a club statement fires up some Eric Carmen.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if The Fiver is aware of a different kind of footballer who already has the Stop Talking movement (Fiver passim) well under way. Marshawn Lynch, American hero and serial crotch-grabber/not-sure-which-camera-to-look-at-er has made it his personal mission to frustrate assorted hacks and delight the trolling American public with one-word or one-phrase answers at the media appearances that he is required by the NFL to attend. Perhaps The Fiver could take up his statement \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m just here so I don\xe2\x80\x99t get fined\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 as its personal motto?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Preston Goulson.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Test marketed the campaign at Montessori level\xe2\x80\x99? Has The Fiver ever more perfectly illustrated the demise of the working-class fan than in this phrase in Nigel Byrne\xe2\x80\x99s letter yesterday. Montessori level, good lord\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Jason Tew.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: \xe2\x80\x98RIP Devilfish\xe2\x80\x99 (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s last line), a sad day indeed. One of the funniest men in poker, my favourite of his one-liners came in London as he was approached outside a casino by a beggar who recognised him: \xe2\x80\x98Any change Devilfish?\xe2\x80\x99 to which he replied: \xe2\x80\x98No, still got the big house and the Range Rover\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Gary Oakes.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
