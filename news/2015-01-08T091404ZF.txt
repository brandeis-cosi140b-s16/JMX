b'Football transfer rumours: Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez to Manchester United?'


b'<p>Here\xe2\x80\x99s a sentence you won\xe2\x80\x99t read very often: poor old Barcelona. It\xe2\x80\x99s all going wrong at the Camp Nou. And no wonder \xe2\x80\x93 look at them, languishing a whole point behind Real Madrid. No one seems to like Luis Enrique, Leo Messi wants out, elections have been brought forward \xe2\x80\xa6 it\xe2\x80\x99s chaos, chaos I tells yer.</p> <p>Which is good news for the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s big beasts. Not only is Messi edging towards the exit like a rabbit who\xe2\x80\x99s just discovered the party he\xe2\x80\x99s at is actually an all-fox affair, but Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez could be coming back to the Premier League. Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea are \xe2\x80\x9cmonitoring\xe2\x80\x9d the Uruguayan (perhaps via some sort of sonar equipment) and are hoping Bar\xc3\xa7a\xe2\x80\x99s next president, whoever that may be, will be prepared to let him leave.</p> <p>Heading in the other direction could be David de Gea, with the Manchester United goalkeeper wanted by both Bar\xc3\xa7a and Real Madrid. If he does depart, Louis van Gaal wants his World Cup penalty shootout trickshot Tim Krul to replace him. And in other goalkeeping news, Arsenal fancy bringing in Petr Cech after losing patience with smokin\xe2\x80\x99 Wojciech Szczesny.</p>  <p> Related: Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s Marcos Rojo sparks fury with drug baron Instagram post </p>   <p>Also looking to swap something erratic for something rather more reliable are Liverpool, who have gone all weak at the knees over Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s James Milner, while Mario Balotelli could be off to Olympiakos on loan until the end of the season.</p> <p>Down in the lower reaches of the Premier League table, West Bromwich Albion want the Blackburn striker Rudy \xe2\x80\x9cA Message To You, Rudy\xe2\x80\x9d Gestede to spearhead their battle against relegation, Sunderland want Celtic\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa38m-rated Virgil van Dijk to shore up their defence and Aston Villa want Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Scott Sinclair to \xe2\x80\xa6 no, we\xe2\x80\x99re not sure on that one.</p> <p>If MLS fans thought they had had enough excitement for one week, then they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to think again. Break out the bunting, pop those champagne corks and gather at the airport \xe2\x80\x93 Emmanuel Adebayor could be heading to a club near you soon. Because Spurs have had enough of him.</p>  <p> Related: Wilfried Bony looks set to become a Manchester City player in days </p>   <p>And back across north London, Arsenal are getting the hump after having two bids knocked back this week. Dinamo Zagreb have turned their noses up at a \xc2\xa35m bid for the 22-year-old midfielder Marcelo Brozovic and Legia Warsaw have been similarly unimpressed by a \xc2\xa32.4m offer for the 17-year-old wunderkind Krystian Bielik.</p>'
