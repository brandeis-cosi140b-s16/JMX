b'Football transfer rumours: Hugo Lloris to Manchester United?'


b'<p>A possible move by Manchester United for Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris is today\xe2\x80\x99s big rumour of the day. Various media outlets report that the French goalkeeper will be lured to Old Trafford should David De Gea sign up with Real Madrid, as is widely suspected. According to a radio interview given by his agent Jorge Mendes, De Gea is currently in talks with United over a new contract, but quill nib has yet to make contact with vellum.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not true that the deal is done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mendes. \xe2\x80\x9cI am negotiating his contract renewal but we haven\xe2\x80\x99t signed anything yet. As of this moment, we will see what happens. We\xe2\x80\x99re holding talks and at this moment, it seems he could continue with United, but as I say, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t signed anything yet.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In other goalkeeping news, that headband-wearing green blob flinging itself around the radars of Arsenal and Liverpool is Mexican stopper Guillermo Ochoa. The subject of multiple internet memes after his World Cup heroics against Brazil last summer, the 29-year-old has fallen out of favour at La Liga side M\xc3\xa1laga, where his appearnaces are being restricted to cup competitions. Ochoa had been tipped to move to Anfield in January, but the deal didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.</p> <p>Liverpool are also hoping to secure the services of Benfica\xe2\x80\x99s Argentinian winger Eduardo Salvio this summer, while Arsenal want 21-year-old Lyon midfielder Nabil Fekir, but may have to fight off interest in the France U-21 international from Paris Saint-Germain. Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal and Manchester United all like the cut of Inter striker Mauro Icardi\xe2\x80\x99s jib, but it is the Premier League leaders who are believed to have begun negotiations with the agent of a player who is believed to be valued at \xc2\xa31m for every one of the 18 goals he\xe2\x80\x99s scored so far this season. Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa335m pursuit of Real Madrid central defender Rapha\xc3\xabl Varane also continues apace, despite their failure to bring him to Stamford Bridge during the January transfer window.</p> <p>Dayot Upomecano is 16 years old, French, half-decent at football and therefore a transfer target for Arsenal. Expect him to sign up for the Gunners, make a four-minute substitute appearance in the Capital One Cup and then find himself unceremoniously farmed out on loan to Concord Rangers or FC Twente.</p> <p>After falling out with team-mates at every club he\xe2\x80\x99s played for, Southampton striker Pablo Osvaldo will take his unique brand of winning people skills to Boca Juniors this week, after a disastrous loan spell at Inter.  </p> <p>Having played for Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s U-21s against their Chelsea counterparts in a 2-1 win on Monday night, Nick Powell is wanted on loan by new Nottingham Forest manager Dougie Freedman, who previously tried to sign the midfielder for Bolton. The 20-year-old had been at Leicester City on a season long loan deal, which was ended prematurely in January. Nigel Pearson is believed to have expressed reservations about the player\xe2\x80\x99s attitude and timekeeping during a four-month spell at the King Power Stadium when he got just 42 minutes of playing time, but presumably did manage to escape without being throttled.</p>         Canadian folkie Dennis Ellsworth failed to impress Leicester City manager Nigel Pearson on Sunday night, but is soldiering on with his UK tour regardless.     <p>And despite also failing to impress Pearson at his local drinker on Sunday night, Canadian folk singer Dennis Ellsworth will overcome what we can only presume is his bemusement at becoming unwittingly embroiled in English football\xe2\x80\x99s latest controversy by continuing his UK tour with shows at The Institute, Kelvedon (13 February), The Gala Theatre, Nottingham (18th), The Greystones, Sheffield (20th), Howard Assembley, Leeds (21st), Loves Cafe, Weston Super Mare (25th), Warwick Arts Centre (26th) and St Philips Church, Manchester (27th). While the Mill would rather gnaw its own arm off than attend a folk gig, it suggests you go along and lend him your support and ears if he happens to be at a venue near you.</p>'
