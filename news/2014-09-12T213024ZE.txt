b'Everton\xe2\x80\x99s Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez: captain Phil Jagielka is not guaranteed place'


b'<p>Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez has said the captain\xe2\x80\x99s armband does not guarantee Phil Jagielka an automatic start at Everton but insisted the England international is recovering from his World Cup disappointment.</p> <p>Jagielka has endured a difficult start to the season as part of a porous Everton defence that has conceded 10 goals in three winless games. For arguably the first time since he joined the club in 2007, the defender\xe2\x80\x99s place is under scrutiny ahead of Everton\xe2\x80\x99s visit to West Bromwich Albion on Saturday with fellow England international John Stones pressing for a recall.</p> <p>Mart\xc3\xadnez admits his Everton captain is not immune to time on the bench, and with seven games in the next three weeks there will be rotation at Goodison Park, but claims a dip in form is to be expected after Jagielka\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in Brazil.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBeing captain is a massive role but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee you anything in respect of playing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Everton manager, who may be without new signing Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o at The Hawthorns due to a groin injury.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI always thought Phil Jagielka, like any player that comes back from the World Cup, was going to have a period to get back to his best. It takes time.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s rare that players come back and carry on with a real good moment of form. It\xe2\x80\x99s rare to see what Kevin Mirallas has done, for example; someone who got to a very good level and had a successful feeling at the World Cup and then takes his level even higher. Phil Jagielka is a leader, someone you can rely on, and the first one who wants to get back to his best level.</p> <p>&quot;I thought his performance with England [against Switzerland in the Euro 2016 qualifier] will help him a lot in terms of having to perform in the hardest moment of the game. Phil will be a very important player for us but no one has playing time guaranteed, that\xe2\x80\x99s for sure.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Stones started twice for England during the international break but did not make Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s starting lineups against Arsenal or Chelsea. Leighton Baines labelled Everton\xe2\x80\x99s defending in the 6-3 loss to Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side as \xe2\x80\x9cembarrassing\xe2\x80\x9d but the manager is adamant the fault can be rectified.</p> <p>Mart\xc3\xadnez added: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a major problem at all. It\xe2\x80\x99s something we have to fix and something we need to address. Defensively, we had the third best record in the league last season. Maybe at the moment, since that late goal at Leicester, our confidence was a little bit touched. This season it\xe2\x80\x99s not as assured as they were last season. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s something we need to get back in ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
