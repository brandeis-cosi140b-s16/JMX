b'Premier League living wage pledge must go further, says campaign leader'


b'<p>The director of the living wage campaign has welcomed a new commitment over full-time employees from the 20 Premier League clubs but urged them to extend the promise to all contracted staff.</p> <p>The Premier League chief executive, Richard Scudamore, has announced that all top-flight clubs will pay the living wage, which currently stands at \xc2\xa39.15 an hour in London and \xc2\xa37.85 outside, to full-time staff from the start of the 2016-17 season.</p> <p>At present only Chelsea are fully accredited to the scheme, although other clubs including Everton, Manchester City and West Ham United have made positive moves towards it.</p> <p>The issue has become a totemic one in the wake of the announcement of the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s huge new domestic TV deal, worth an overall \xc2\xa35.3bn, a figure that could rise to \xc2\xa38.5bn once overseas sales are factored in.</p> <p>As part of a package of promises designed to head off criticism, the Premier League clubs made the living wage commitment on Thursday.</p> <p>But while the director of the campaign, Rhys Moore, broadly welcomed the move, he said it should be extended to the subcontractors such as matchday stewards and catering staff who make up the majority of the employees at top-flight clubs.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe broadly welcome this move on the part of the clubs acting collectively. It is definitely a move in the right direction. However, the vast majority of low-paid work in the Premier League is with subcontractors. This commitment doesn\xe2\x80\x99t address that, which is why we think living wage accreditation is so important,\xe2\x80\x9d said Moore.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe commitment Chelsea made to become the only accredited living wage employer in the Premier League goes so much further than this.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>A delegation of Citizens UK members who had been working on a campaign to persuade football clubs to commit to paying the living wage met Premier League executives after the unveiling of the TV deal and delivered a Change.org e-petition that had reached 65,000 signatures.</p> <p>Scudamore\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to promise to persuade clubs to pay the living wage the morning after announcing its \xc2\xa35.14bn live domestic rights deal with Sky and BT became a lightning rod for criticism.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAt the end of the day there\xe2\x80\x99s a thing called the living wage but there\xe2\x80\x99s also a minimum wage, and politicians do have the power to up that minimum wage. That\xe2\x80\x99s entirely for the politicians to do, that\xe2\x80\x99s not for us to do,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the BBC after the announcement of the record TV deal. David Lammy, the MP for Tottenham, responded that Scudamore should feel ashamed of not backing the living wage campaign.</p> <p>Martin Wroe, a vicar and writer from London who chaired the meeting with the Premier League, has estimated that there are approximately 40,000 employees within the Premier League currently working below the living wage.</p> <p>On Thursday Scudamore said he was \xe2\x80\x9cproud\xe2\x80\x9d of the clubs for taking the decision over the living wage and for committing to the redistribution of at least \xc2\xa31bn of the broadcasting deal, which is likely to top \xc2\xa38bn once overseas sales are taken into account.</p> <p>However, that figure includes the sums paid out in parachute payments to relegated clubs and Scudamore said that detailed discussions about how it would be divided would have to wait until the overseas rights were sold and an ongoing Ofcom investigation had concluded.</p>'
