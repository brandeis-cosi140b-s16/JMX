b'Bayern Munich v Shakhtar Donetsk: Champions League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s all folks, Bayern record the joint-best ever Champions League result (only after Liverpool 8-0 Besiktas in 2007) and cruise through to the quarter finals. A real shame that this match never really got going, as the Ukrainian team would surely have tested the German champions with 11 men. But credit to Bayern, as Lewandowski aside, they were typically clinical.</p> <p>There will be slight worries for both Robben and Ribery, who were both substituted with injuries. It is also maybe the last time we will see all those Brazilians in a Shakhtar shirt in Europe, with a a number of clubs poised to make bids for Costa, Fred, and Teixeira in the summer.</p> <p>Man of the match? Boateng: one goal, two assists. Tidy.</p>    <p>THAT&#39;S IT!!
