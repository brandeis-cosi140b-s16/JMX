b'Football transfer rumours: Fabio Coe\xc3\xb1trao to Manchester United?'


b'<p>It has taken seven games for Louis van Gaal to realise Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s defence aren\xe2\x80\x99t up to scratch, so he has entrusted \xc3\x81ngel di Mar\xc3\xada to persuade F\xc3\xa1bio Coentr\xc3\xa3o to follow him from the Madrid sunshine to the freezing cold and wet of the north-west in January. Better still for Van Gaal, Gerard Piqu\xc3\xa9 could return from Barcelona now Roy Keane is no longer at Old Trafford to \xe2\x80\x9cscare the shit\xe2\x80\x9d out of him.</p> <p>The wheels also appear in motion for Radamel Falcao\xe2\x80\x99s move to be made permanent \xe2\x80\x93 despite the fact he has yet to score. He may change his mind when the clocks go back at the end of the month and fails to see a single glimmer of sunlight until season\xe2\x80\x99s end. Personal terms may already have been agreed with Ed Woodward prepared to stump up \xc2\xa3250,000-a-week. That\xe2\x80\x99s over \xc2\xa3100,000 more than the average house price in Manchester.</p> <p>Dani Alves has also had enough of the Mediterranean and wants to move to the Premier League. You\xe2\x80\x99ll never guess where he might be off to? Yes, Manchester United. Although Liverpool are interested too.</p> <p>MK Dons\xe2\x80\x99 highly-rated midfielder Dele Alli could be on his way to Anfield in January \xe2\x80\x93 only to be loaned back down south right away for the rest of the season.</p> <p>After his best week to date as West Brom manager, Alan Irvine has put his foot in it by talking about the inevitable: Saido Berahino will be off, once a big club comes calling.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Lukas Podolski is getting fed up of the Emirates bench and has warned things have to change or he will leave Arsenal. Which is fine, seeing as his Instagram account appears to show him spending every free moment at home in Cologne.</p> <p>Chelsea are the front-runners to sign Sami Khedira from Real Madrid. His contract ends next summer but he could arrive in January, despite interest from United and Arsenal, who could do really do with another midfielder who has had his fair share of injury problems.</p>'
