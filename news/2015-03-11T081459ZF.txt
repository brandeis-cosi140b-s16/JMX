b"Football transfer rumours: Chelsea to sign PSG's Marquinhos?"


b'<p>To suggest that David Luiz looks like Sideshow Bob is nothing new. But the Rumour Mill would like to go out on a limb and suggest that there\xe2\x80\x99s a touch of the Sideshow Mel \xe2\x80\x93 Bob\xe2\x80\x99s clowning replacement \xe2\x80\x93 about the Brazilian defender\xe2\x80\x99s compatriot and PSG team-mate, Marquinhos (albeit without the funky hair and bone). </p> <p>As such it should come as no surprise, that much like a more dapper Krusty the Clown, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho wants to bring in his own Sideshow Mel to replace serial (title-bid) killer Sideshow Bob. It may have taken a year, but the links to PSG\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa340m defender keep on growing, and while Manchester United may harbour an interest Chelsea are ready to swoop. Unless of course this is just the usual pre-match tittle tattle, designed to upset one of your opponent\xe2\x80\x99s key players. Surely not?</p>     David Luiz and Sideshow Bob \xe2\x80\x93 can you tell the difference? Photograph: The Guardian    <p>If United are beaten to the PSG defender then they will turn to one of Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s old flames, Rapha\xc3\xabl Varane. Louis van Gaal thinks the Real Madrid centre-back is the man to sure up his porous defence, and the Frenchman would set the club back the suspiciously precise figure of \xc2\xa339.4m. Of course, Chelsea are on the case too, viewing Varane as another option to replace John Terry\xe2\x80\x99s ageing limbs.</p> <p>And the Blues aren\xe2\x80\x99t done there. After pictures emerged of real life Simpsons star Lionel Messi enjoying a spot of dinner with old Barcelona pal Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas, some took the opportunity to put two and two together and get \xc2\xa3100m record transfer deal. With far-fetched gossip like that how are the readers to believe anything? Won\xe2\x80\x99t somebody think of the children?</p> <p>PSG, anxious not to be left out of such scuttle-butt, are lining up an \xc2\xa38.5m move for C\xc3\xa9sar Azpilicueta. The Mill thinks the Parisians could have tried a bit harder if they were attempting to unsettle the Stamford Bridge defence ahead of Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League showdown.</p> <p>In Liverpool, a slimmed-down Mayor Joe Quimby has sent his minions over to Italy to bring back a bit of Brazilian talent. Reports on the continent say that Anfield scout Paul Goldrick was in Rome to watch Felipe Anderson, an attacking midfielder with seven goals and eight assists in 23 matches this season for Lazio. Of course, Brendan Rodgers won\xe2\x80\x99t have it all his own way, with Manchesters City and United, and Chelsea, all weighing up a \xc2\xa320m bid. If Anderson slips through Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s fingers they\xe2\x80\x99ll return to Rome for Roma\xe2\x80\x99s Miralem Pjanic. </p> <p>Manchester City may have more pressing matters to attend to though, with tittle-tattle emerging that their captain Vincent Kompany was involved in a furious bust-up with Fernandinho at half-time in their defeat to Liverpool. The squabble was apparently so bad that Manuel Pellegrini felt the need to drop Kompany for their next game, a comfortable win against Leicester. Rumours that the row was caused by an unreturned Simpsons Season Six box set could not be corroborated by the Mill at time of going to press. </p>     Stephan El Shaarawy does his best Bart Simpson impression. Ricardo Moraes/Reuters Photograph: Ricardo Moraes/Reuters    <p>Meanwhile, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger, disappointed by Santi Cazorla\xe2\x80\x99s new shorn locks, is giving Milan\xe2\x80\x99s very own spiky-haired play-maker the eye, with Stephan El Shaarawy reportedly of interest to the collector of nimble-of-feet attacking midfielders.</p> <p>El Shaarawy is out with a broken metatarsal, but injury has never stopped Wenger in the past, so expect an Arsenal bid imminently. \xe2\x80\x9cMy goal is to get back as soon as possible. The interest of Arsenal surely gratifies me but my goal is to return to Milan and do well at Milan,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Italian attacker, presumably not followed by a rendition of the 90s classic Do the Bartman.</p> <p>And if that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work Wenger will instead turn to Aleksandar Dragovic. Forget that Dynamo Kyiv\xe2\x80\x99s Austrian plays in an entirely different position \xe2\x80\x93 at centre-back - North London\xe2\x80\x99s Principal Skinner needs a player with spiky vertiginous Bart-like hair to act out his Springfield role-play, and Dragovic has proved in the past that he could fit the bill. </p>'
