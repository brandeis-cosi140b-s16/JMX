b'Football transfer rumours: Van Persie out, Cavani in at Manchester United?'


b'<p>Having missed Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s past six matches through injury and failed to cover himself in too much glory in the ones he has played under his compatriot Louis van Gaal, it looks as if Robin van Persie might be cut loose by Manchester United this summer. For all the pre-season talk of how he and van Gaal would enjoy country walks, trips to the Arndale centre and moonlit swims together upon teaming up at Old Trafford, the 31-year-old has endured a miserable season and the Mirror reports that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be sold this summer to free up \xc2\xa3200,000 of weekly wages that will find their way into the bank account of PSG\xe2\x80\x99s Edinson Cavani. A handsome, lank-haired South American striker moving to Manchester United from a high profile Ligue 1 club? What could possibly wrong?</p> <p>Leeds United\xe2\x80\x99s crushing last-gasp 4-3 defeat at the hands of Wolverhampton Wanderers on Monday will have caused Sam Byram no end of anguish, but the 20-year-old full-back from Essex will be flattered by the news that he is being linked with an \xc2\xa38m move to Liverpool. A competent young defender who loves a good bomb forward on the old overlap, Byram\xe2\x80\x99s name has previously been mentioned in conjunction with moves to Everton and Manchester City while Sunderland and Southampton are also reported to have had offers rejected.</p> <p>It being that time of that time of the season when stories about potential massive-money moves for Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 mysteriously begin appearing with monotonous regularity, it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise to read that Inter are cranking up their interest in bringing the Ivorian to the San Siro on a five-year deal worth the thick end of \xc2\xa355m to the player. Accused of ducking his head out of the path of Jason Puncheon\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful free-kick for Crystal Palace during City\xe2\x80\x99s latest reverse, the 31-year-old is unlikely to cower in the face of such largesse from the Serie A club.</p> <p>With just a season left on his contract, the 27-year-old Belgian winger Kevin Mirallas could find himself the object of a tug-of-love between West Ham and Tottenham Hotspur, while the German newspaper Bild reports that Chelsea and Manchester United are among a plethora of clubs continuing to make cooing noises at Augsburg\xe2\x80\x99s 20-year-old Ghanaian left-back Abdul Rahman Baba. Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund, Schalke and Real Madrid have joined them in what is unlikely to be an orderly queue.</p> <p>For all the myriad charms of the beautiful city that is Naples, it\xe2\x80\x99s being reported that Gonzalo Higua\xc3\xadn has begun to tire of life there and wants to leave for pastures new. Arsenal are confident of securing his services. Meanwhile, in Turin, a certain Old Lady is rubbing her hands together at the prospect of breasting the tape ahead of the Gunners in the well-documented race to sign Higua\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s compatriot, the highly-sought-after 21-year-old Palermo striker Paulo Dybala for \xe2\x82\xac30m. Arsenal are also rumoured to be interested in PSG\xe2\x80\x99s former Newcastle midfielder Yohan Cabaye, who would cost them \xc2\xa310m, the price of a Eurostar fare and a taxi or Tube fare to cover the short hop from St Pancras station to the Emirates.</p> <p>Meanwhile back in Germany, Bayern Munich are hoping to sign the Real Madrid full-back Sergio Ramos, while in what sounds like a bout of introspective ennui, the Borussia Dortmund defender and Manchester United target Mats Hummels has conceded that he is pondering his future, the general meaning of life and what it\xe2\x80\x99s all about.</p>'
