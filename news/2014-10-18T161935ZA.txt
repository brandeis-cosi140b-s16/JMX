b'Arsenal 2-2 Hull City | Premier League match report'


b'<p></p> <p></p> <p>It is unusual for both managers to step away from the dugout and express a similar level of rueful disappointment. That was the case here as Steve Bruce lamented how Hull were unable to cling on to what would have been a satisfying victory, followed by Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger airing his deep frustration.</p> <p>Wenger was distinctly unimpressed with his team\xe2\x80\x99s habit of enjoying possession but conceding self-inflicted goals due to defensive lapses. Of course, some of the accountability for that should stare the Frenchman in the face if he looks in the mirror. Defensive shortcomings are perhaps not surprising in a squad built without enough experienced defenders.</p> <p>Hull were able to capitalise. They were enterprising, solid and Bruce\xe2\x80\x99s instincts told him they were comfortable enough to see out a 2-1 lead as a fractious game ticked into stoppage time. For Arsenal, the consolation of a draw salvaged by a late combination between Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez and Danny Welbeck certainly reduces the heat that was beginning to boil up inside the Emirates. But considering Arsenal have won a mere two games out of eight in the Premier League this season, for all the relief of the equaliser, the general mood as the crowd drifted off was of discontent.</p> <p>It was an odd, jerking see-saw of a contest. Hull began in such casual mood Arsenal could have been in charge early on as they created a string of chances. Steve Harper, the veteran goalkeeper, excelled to beat down a drive from Welbeck and then tip over Santi Cazorla\xe2\x80\x99s pearl of a curling shot. The initial sluggishness from the visitors was punished in virtuoso style by S\xc3\xa1nchez in the 13th minute. A salsa run down the right propelled him into the box, and he struck early \xe2\x80\x93 low and lethal \xe2\x80\x93 to give Arsenal the lead.</p> <p>Not for long. Mohamed Diam\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s powerful weaving run carved through the heart of Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s makeshift defence. Nacho Monreal, the emergency centre-half in Laurent Koscielny\xe2\x80\x99s absence, showed scant resistance. Mathieu Flamini was too easily pulled away, and Diam\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s dinked finish was cooly executed.</p>           Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger and Steve Bruce react to draw \xe2\x80\x93 video    <p>Arsenal protested furiously to the referee, Roger East, claiming a foul on Flamini. Bruce acknowledged that Hull had been fortunate, describing the moment of controversy as an \xe2\x80\x9cindividual piece of grappling\xe2\x80\x9d with a glint in his eye. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe we have got a decision. You don\xe2\x80\x99t get many of them at the Emirates. It was a good one to get.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It got much worse for Arsenal as they started the second half as if in a distant reverie. Straight from kick-off Hull passed the ball neatly and found Tom Huddlestone on the right flank. There were plenty of home defenders in the box as he crossed, but Abel Hern\xc3\xa1ndez\xe2\x80\x99s movement was so switched on, so alert, he ruthlessly exposed Per Mertesacker to head Hull in front as numerous supporters were ambling back from their half time refreshment. Bruce was thrilled at what he called \xe2\x80\x9ca goal to grace any arena\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>The Uruguayan had been promoted from the bench when Nikica Jelavic twisted his knee in the warm-up. That was one of three injuries Hull suffered. Harper tore a muscle in his biceps and Michael Dawson\xe2\x80\x99s ankle, according to Bruce, was \xe2\x80\x9cthe size of a basketball\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Arsenal strained to get a foothold back in the game. Their play was intricate, and Hull\xe2\x80\x99s defensive and midfield blocks presented a formidable barrier. The trio of Jake Livermore, Huddlestone and Diam\xc3\xa9 showed great resolve.</p> <p>The Emirates air was thick with frustration. Wenger looked stressed on the touchline. The atmosphere was tempestuous. Arsenal came close when S\xc3\xa1nchez ghosted in to glance in a fine header \xe2\x80\x93 matched by a superb tip-over from the replacement goalkeeper Eldin Jakupovic. Finally, the Chilean made the difference with a spurt of inspiration and a clever assist for Welbeck, who finished smartly with his left foot.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the fourth time we have conceded in the last minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruce, before suggesting that if a draw at the Emirates is frustrating that has to be a sign of the club\xe2\x80\x99s progress.</p> <p>Arsenal, though, have questions about theirs as they lie 11 points behind Chelsea. Wenger was annoyed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a big concern. The other teams win and we don\xe2\x80\x99t. We had 80% possession and only one point. We were unlucky with the ref on the first goal, on the second we only blame ourselves. Defensive concentration was missing and you cannot give goals away like that.\xe2\x80\x9d Full of regret, both teams went home.</p>'
