b'Vincent Kompany had a point \xe2\x80\x93 but can a home crowd still make a difference? | Paul Wilson'


b'<p>Vincent Kompany would seem to have a perfectly valid complaint about the crowd situation when Manchester City met CSKA Moscow in the Champions League. Whether the unusual atmosphere excused another below-par performance from City is another matter \xe2\x80\x93 it probably did not, though Kompany was not trying to make excuses \xe2\x80\x93 but there are clearly issues here that Uefa need to have a look at.</p> <p>First off, if playing behind closed doors is a punishment, then closed doors should mean just that. Total exclusion, no one allowed in, not even corporates from the home club. If Uefa were really serious about punishing CSKA for the racist incidents that set this train of events in motion, they would now be asking why the club allowed the obvious intention of the measure to be flouted.</p> <p>Fair enough, with no more than 350 people inside the stadium is still basically empty, but a few hundred supporters can make their voices heard in an empty stadium and if the only chanting the players could hear was in favour of CSKA then City were clearly disadvantaged when their own fans were not allowed inside the ground. Several hundred City supporters were thought to have made the arduous journey to Moscow, mainly because they had made travel arrangements before the sanctions on CSKA were announced.</p> <p>That is another area Uefa could tighten up. Ideally spectator bans and the like should be announced in advance of competition draws, but if that is not possible and the governing body is under pressure to act immediately, then fans of the innocent opponents who have made the journey in good faith should be allowed in. They are not under any suspicion of racist behaviour, and they are at least as deserving of entry as CSKA\xe2\x80\x99s corporate clients. As Kompany said, it was hard to work out who was actually being punished in this instance. If exceptions could be made for the home side they certainly could have been for the visitors.</p> <p>If City feel badly done to, they could always reflect that Real Madrid will have it worse at Liverpool. The Anfield stadium will not be empty, it will not be echoey and quiet, it will be raucous and full-throated, and we have been hearing all week from a selection of players who know \xe2\x80\x93 Steven Gerrard, \xc3\x81lvaro Arbeloa, even Cristiano Ronaldo \xe2\x80\x93 that the atmosphere Liverpool supporters can generate is capable of putting opponents off their stride. Even opponents as garlanded as Real Madrid. According to Arbeloa, who used to play for Liverpool under Rafa Ben\xc3\xadtez, a European night at Anfield is certain to be an intimidating experience.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe are in for a tough game, I have told all the players that. Even league matches have a special atmosphere here,\xe2\x80\x9d the Spanish defender said at Anfield in advance of the game. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is difficult to explain, you just have to experience it. People are telling me Liverpool did not play all that well at the weekend but believe me if they had lost 10-0 at QPR I would still be worried about coming here for a European night.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Hang on, time for a bit of perspective. Arbeloa regularly plays in front of crowds of 85,000. Just this weekend there is a tasty bit of business coming up with his side\xe2\x80\x99s good friends from Barcelona. The Bernab\xc3\xa9u is the sort of imposing edifice that makes even Anfield look a little bit like Loftus Road, and Real Madrid fans are not noted for their quiet, thoughtful demeanour during games. So is Arbeloa really saying Anfield trumps all that, or is he simply peddling a popular myth? Popular in the sense that people want it to be true, not just in the sense that many people believe it.</p> <p>The question is asked because a few weeks ago, in advance of Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s opening Champions League game against Ludogorets, Philippe Coutinho came up with a similar line to Arbeloa\xe2\x80\x99s, about the atmosphere at Anfield being special even for an ordinary league match. Oh no it isn\xe2\x80\x99t, chorused back a selection of responses on Twitter, many of them bearing Everton avatars.</p> <p>Liverpool have some good songs, everybody knows that, but there have been times this season when Anfield has been as silent as the proverbial library. If Liverpool aren\xe2\x80\x99t plundering spectacular goals from all over the pitch, and let\xe2\x80\x99s face it that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been happening much this season, Anfield is just as likely to go quiet as any other ground in the league.</p> <p>Evertonians would say that though, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they? And doubtless there were a few Mancunian points of view being expressed as well.</p> <p>For Liverpool supporters such opinions amount to heresy, although one did get in touch to say the Anfield matchday atmosphere has been getting gradually flatter, bit by bit, season by season, for the last 20 years or so. Sad but true, he remarked. There are two reasons why. First, all-seater stadiums, introduced for reasons all too familiar to anyone on Merseyside, have basically sanitised the footballing experience. The sort of overcrowded, dangerous yet undeniably intoxicating terrace scenes that accompanied Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s early successes in the European Cup cannot be recreated any more, for solid reasons of safety.</p> <p>The other reason is that the introduction of seats and subsequent escalation of ticket prices has changed the nature of football crowds, not just at Anfield but at other grounds in England. Not everyone can afford regular attendance any more. You need a certain level of income for a season ticket. Football crowds have become more middle-aged, more family oriented, and therefore more sensible and sedate. Liverpool still retains many of its old traditions and a lot of the atmosphere that made it famous, but even Anfield has not been immune to the process. A time traveller from 30 years ago would easily notice the difference.</p> <p>That is not to say the old place cannot whip up a storm any more on a European night. As recently as the Ben\xc3\xadtez era, when Liverpool played Chelsea in the Champions League, a vivid recollection remains of Michael Howard, then at the height of his career in the Conservative party, on his feet in the main stand joining in with all the songs. He clearly did not wish to be seen as the only Liverpool supporter not singing, though he might have been the only person in the ground not swearing.</p> <p>When even the people in the posh seats are willing to stand up and sing, you can build up quite an atmosphere even with a capacity of 45,000. Liverpool are still doing that better than anyone else, and looking at the comments of Coutinho, who has played in Brazil and Italy, and Arbeloa, who is back in Spain, it is tempting to conclude that English football in general has noisier, more impassioned crowds than is common on the continent. If Coutinho and Arbeloa are blown away by the present Anfield atmosphere, goodness knows what they would have made of the St Etienne game in 1977.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole ground is shaking,\xe2\x80\x9d Gerald Sinstadt said in his memorable TV commentary. \xe2\x80\x9cThe French players won\xe2\x80\x99t have seen anything like this before.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The camera then cut to what can only be described as a Kop in ferment, complete with banner proclaiming: \xe2\x80\x9cJoey eats frogs\xe2\x80\x99 legs\xe2\x80\x9d. Sinstadt was spot on. We just won\xe2\x80\x99t be seeing anything like it again either.</p>'
