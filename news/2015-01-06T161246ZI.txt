b'Impersonating Steve McQueen | The Fiver'


b'<p>A FUNDAMENTAL LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIRE AND WATER</p> <p>The Fiver knows all about stress. Playing hide and seek with The Man as deadline approaches puts enormous strain on the ticker \xe2\x80\x93 especially when we have eff all to show for the many hours spent trawling the internet for jokes that can be spun into a satirical take on football news and passed off as funny and free. That\xe2\x80\x99s pressure. Right there reader.</p> <p>But we have a few available ways to let off steam. This is King\xe2\x80\x99s Cross after all. Tin, cuddling, funky-cigarettes, illegal arm-wrestling and Weird Uncle Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s special bookshop number just a few. We can do pretty much anything. No one cares. Not even The Man. But consider poor Wojciech Szczesny. After making a right royal show of himself in Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s 2-0 defeat at Southampton last weekend \xe2\x80\x93 in which he galloped off his line like a rabid dog chasing its favourite toy to allow Sadio Man\xc3\xa9 to lob him for the first and then inexplicably poked the ball to Dusan Tadic to score Saints\xe2\x80\x99 second \xe2\x80\x93 you could forgive him for wanting to soothe his jiggered ego after the match.</p> <p>But it appears the poor judgment that he displayed on the pitch followed him into the St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s showers. You see, after scrubbing his body and polishing his big brass neck clean, Szczesny sparked up. Now, with Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger presumably in close proximity and many a scantily-clad team-mate knocking about who could receive a nasty burn to the buttock, it probably wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the cleverest thing the Polish stopper has ever done. Particularly given Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s previous with Arsenal players who like a good chuff.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI disagree completely with that behaviour. When you are a football player you are an example and you don\xe2\x80\x99t do what damages your health,\xe2\x80\x9d parped Wenger after Jack Wilshere\xe2\x80\x99s first attempt at impersonating Steve McQueen back in October 2013. The Arsenal midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent attempt \xe2\x80\x93 on a lads\xe2\x80\x99 holiday with Joe Hart in Las Vegas \xe2\x80\x93 won\xe2\x80\x99t have done much to improve Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s attitude towards smoking either. In Szczesny\xe2\x80\x99s case the true cost of having a puff has been a \xc2\xa320,000 fine and possibly his place in the Arsenal starting line-up against Stoke. Reports that he may be left out for the remainder of the season have been emphatically stubbed out by the club.</p> <p>Perhaps Wenger should have cut Szczesny some slack. After all, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know what\xe2\x80\x99s most damaging to his wellbeing: playing behind Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s comedy troupe of a defence, or having the odd crafty drag.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Gregg Bakowski from 7.45pm GMT for MBM coverage of Everton 2-1 West Ham in the FA Cup.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is complete arrogance for him to expect us to make special arrangements just because it\xe2\x80\x99s him. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what Pardew was doing for [that long]. You can crawl up there on all fours in a couple of minutes. He was also very rude to staff\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Dover Athletic chairman Jim Parmenter takes a pop at the new Crystal Palace boss after he complained about his squad having to walk 20 minutes to the Crabble ground from their coach drop-off point.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was good of $tevie Mbe to announce his departure from Liverpool five months in advance (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver). Having announced it this way, now all us neutrals can be treated to five months of fawning media queries about just what Liverpool will do without him every time he scores a goal or manages to play a pass that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sail over the touchline. We\xe2\x80\x99ve already had some ludicrous media contortions about how he\xe2\x80\x99s footballs ultimate \xe2\x80\x98one-club man\xe2\x80\x99, despite the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\xa6 erm, leaving to play for another club, unlike inferior one-club men like say Franco Baresi, Ryan Giggs or Paolo Maldini. He\xe2\x80\x99s leaving because his manager told him he needs to have the number of games he plays managed, an idea that Mbe himself is \xe2\x80\x98totally fine with\xe2\x80\x99 even though he\xe2\x80\x99s now leaving, the conversation reluctantly revealed to the press by $tevie but obviously not to throw Brendan Rodgers under the bus as the reason for his departure in the middle of a difficult season. This whole media fuss isn\xe2\x80\x99t about $tevie Mbe, honestly, it\xe2\x80\x99s about the fans deserving to know the truth\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Jason Tew.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn spite of all the anti-Liverpool, pro-Ker-ayzeee Gang media bias, I was quite taken with the AFC Wimbledon fans\xe2\x80\x99 chant of \xe2\x80\x98we support our local team\xe2\x80\x99 last night. I found it rather quaint, kind of like one would support one\xe2\x80\x99s local butcher\xe2\x80\x99s or library (Google it, kids). It was rather spoilt however by the \xe2\x80\x98Dorset Dons\xe2\x80\x99 England flag which hovered frequently into view.
