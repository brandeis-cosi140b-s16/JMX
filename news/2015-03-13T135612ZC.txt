b'Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho hits back at Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has claimed Graeme Souness is \xe2\x80\x9ca frustrated man\xe2\x80\x9d and accused him and Jamie Carragher of having short memories over their criticisms of Chelsea players during their Champions League exit to Paris Saint-Germain in midweek.</p> <p>The sight of nine of the London club\xe2\x80\x99s outfield players crowding around the referee, Bjorn Kuipers, following Zlatan Ibrahimovic\xe2\x80\x99s challenge on Oscar had been branded \xe2\x80\x9cdisgraceful\xe2\x80\x9d by Carragher in his capacity as a pundit for Sky.</p> <p>Souness, sitting at his side in the studio at Stamford Bridge, was equally scathing and described the conduct as \xe2\x80\x9cpathetic\xe2\x80\x9d while praising PSG as \xe2\x80\x9ca proper team\xe2\x80\x9d for standing up to their hosts. Yet Mourinho reacted with incredulity at those comments. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know the world is a bit strange,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe because of diet and maybe the quality of the products we are eating, but memories are getting shorter. Because, you know, when Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness speak about it, it\xe2\x80\x99s because they are having a problem for sure. Jamie stopped playing a couple of years ago and, in two years, he has forgotten everything he did on the pitch.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMr Souness also, but he stopped playing a long time ago. I coached Benfica after he left there so I know a lot about him, so much about him. But I have had a certain kind of education, not just in football but in life, and I prefer to laugh. Envy is the biggest tribute that the shadows do to the man. It\xe2\x80\x99s about life.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Chelsea are not panicking but must rediscover spark after PSG blow | Dominic Fifield </p>   <p>Asked to elaborate on the clear friction which exists between him and Souness, Mourinho explained: \xe2\x80\x9cThe difference between me and Souness is this. Souness as a player, up there [holds his hand above his head]. Jos\xc3\xa9 as a player, down there [lowers it again]. But Jos\xc3\xa9 as a manager, up there. Souness as a manager, down there.With another difference. I was not a frustrated man because I was not a top player. He is clearly a frustrated man. A fantastic player, and I have lots of respect, in spite of some episodes, for a fantastic player with a fantastic career in a fantastic club with a top generation of players. Lots of respect.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Sky\xe2\x80\x99s punditry team has been spiky at times this season, particularly over the coverage of Diego Costa\xe2\x80\x99s performance against Liverpool in the second leg of the Capital One Cup semi-finals. He had singled out Jamie Redknapp at the time and, while peace appeared to have been brokered with a performance on the network\xe2\x80\x99s Goals on Sunday show, the comments in midweek have left the situation frosty once again.</p> <p>The manager offered a strong defence of his players\xe2\x80\x99 general conduct by pointing out Chelsea have been charged only once this season for failing to control their players \xe2\x80\x93 following last month\xe2\x80\x99s win over Everton, where a melee on the pitch also saw the visitors sanctioned.</p> <p>Ibrahimovic had suggested the home players had behaved \xe2\x80\x9clike 11 babies\xe2\x80\x9d seeking to have him sent off following his challenge on Oscar, but the Chelsea manager rejected that criticism. If they surround the referee [in the Premier League] we are charged and we have to pay a fine, and if we do that the players pay the fine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho, whose team were fined \xc2\xa330,000 by the Football Association for that incident against Everton.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe have, in this moment I think, had eight or nine months of competition and we were charged once. We paid for that. It\xe2\x80\x99s as simple as that. Go to the Premier League and see how many teams were charged and how many times. Chelsea were charged once. Against PSG the game finished and one by one \xe2\x80\x93 not just the players but the coaches from PSG \xe2\x80\x93 I shook their hands. I told them they deserved it. This was the way we behave after a defeat.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the example my players get after a defeat. I went to my dressing room, I put everybody together because I am normally very calm and think people deserve to go home and reflect before they speak so as to be without any doubt or emotion, this is what we did.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
