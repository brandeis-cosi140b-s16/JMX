b'Ronald Koeman tells Southampton to go for it against Chelsea'


b'<p>At first it was just a language problem that led Ronald Koeman to say he did not understand the question about whether he would be tempted to \xe2\x80\x9cpark the bus\xe2\x80\x9d when Chelsea pull into St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s on Sunday. Then it became clear that it was not just the phrase that was unfamiliar to him: the very concept of opting for an ultra-defensive approach is alien to the Dutchman, who insisted that Southampton will attack against the league leaders.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI believe in our way of playing and not to change the system, we try to do it our way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Koeman, whose team have regained their early-season form thanks to successive victories over Everton and Crystal Palace.</p> <p>Those wins have restored confidence after five straight defeats had stifled talk about the club challenging for a place in next season\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League. Southampton have climbed back into the top four and even though they have lost to all the big-name sides that they have faced \xe2\x80\x93 Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United, Liverpool and Tottenham \xe2\x80\x93 Koeman is intent on ensuring his team will not take an inferiority complex into the meeting with Chelsea. Koeman dares to try to keep his team among the elite by playing with boldness.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe are dreaming a little bit now because we have a great position in the league,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had a difficult time after some defeats. We have now won two in a row, that\xe2\x80\x99s important, game by game to do our best and what we like to do: play attractive football, offensive football. And go for it. But that means every game, not because our opponent is Chelsea or Manchester City. No, we go for it. That\xe2\x80\x99s football and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t go for it, stay home.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Although he has not altered his attacking approach, Koeman has helped stimulate Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s resurgence by changing his system, with the wins over Everton and Palace coming in a new 3-5-2 arrangement.</p> <p>The team has also benefitted from the return to fitness of influential players such as James Ward-Prowse, with Koeman even enjoying the luxury of rotating a squad that was short of options a few weeks ago, as Dusan Tadic, Victor Wanyama and Shane Long began on the bench at Palace.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAll the lads are buzzing and we\xe2\x80\x99re back on track,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ward-Prowse. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is going to be a great game between two teams that are in form now. It will be an entertaining encounter.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cChelsea are a fantastic side, have a lot of world-class players but if we are to get to where we want to get to in Europe we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have play teams like this. That\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of challenge and we\xe2\x80\x99re ready for it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
