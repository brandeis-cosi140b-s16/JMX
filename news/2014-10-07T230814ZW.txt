b'<p>\xe2\x80\x9cLiverpool are making a habit of coming second and then not following it up,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Patrick Routledge, neither unreasonably nor inaccurately. \xe2\x80\x9cAre they the masters of failing to build on promising seasons?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Liverpool are indeed becoming well versed in the fine art of finishing a season in runners-up spot and then failing to seal the deal in the following campaign. Since their last title in 1990, they\xe2\x80\x99ve come second on four occasions \xe2\x80\x93 1990-91, 2001-02, 2008-09 and 2013-14 \xe2\x80\x93 and unless the likes of Mario Balotelli, Lazar Markovic and Dejan Lovren get their act together immediately if not sooner, this season will be four campaigns from four in which Liverpool have failed to take the final step to glory in the wake of a near miss.</p> <p>Throw in an inability to build on second-place finishes in 1973-74, 1968-69, 1909-10 and 1898-99, and we can see that Liverpool are serial offenders here. Eight times they\xe2\x80\x99ve failed to capitalise on their momentum! But they\xe2\x80\x99re not England\xe2\x80\x99s worst performers in this particular respect. Step forward the backslippers supreme, Aston Villa, who have failed to take the step from second to first on 10 occasions. A questionable record stretches from this grand old club\xe2\x80\x99s Victorian pomp \xe2\x80\x93 they were the very first runners-up in English league football, but could only come eighth the season after \xe2\x80\x93 to the Premier League era. Not only that, theirs is a 100 %, 10-from-10 record. Liverpool can at least gain some solace from the five times they\xe2\x80\x99ve converted second-place finishes into championships 12 months later.</p> <p>A high profile in this peculiar list is, of course, a function of involvement in plenty of title scraps in the first place. So like 18-time champions Liverpool, you\xe2\x80\x99d expect 20-time champions Manchester United to feature heavily. And indeed United have failed to build on second-place finishes seven times in their history, level second right now with Liverpool. However United have a significantly better conversion rate, having taken the step from second to first on eight other occasions. They\xe2\x80\x99ve also never failed to build on a second-place finish during the Premier League era, for what that distinction is worth.</p> <p>Preston North End are next on the list, all six of their second-place finishes leading to nothing tangible. Four of those failures came during the league\xe2\x80\x99s infancy \xe2\x80\x93 the Lilywhites couldn\xe2\x80\x99t improve on their runners-up finishes of 1890-91, 1891-92, 1892-93 and 1905-06 \xe2\x80\x93 while the last two instances came during the 1950s, which may come as something of a surprise when you consider Preston\xe2\x80\x99s thoroughly Victorian image, but becomes less so when you remember Tom Finney would have been wreaking havoc after the war.</p> <p>Meanwhile there are three teams who have failed on five occasions to convert the cruel gruel of a second-place finish into delicious championship-winning gravy 12 months later. Everton are the best of this bunch, having at least managed to take the step up after two other runners-up seasons. The other two have never followed second place with first, failing five times out of five: Wolverhampton Wanderers and \xe2\x80\x93 of course, how could we forget them \xe2\x80\x93 English football\xe2\x80\x99s most infamous nearly men, Don Revie\xe2\x80\x99s Leeds United. In a particularly painful sequence, Leeds came second five times in eight years between 1965 and 1972, and always came up short the year after. (Their title during that period, in 1968-69, came after a third-place finish.) The conclusion? As Bill Shankly once said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are second, you are nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In fact, exactly why we expect runners-up to go on to win the championship the following year is a moot point. It\xe2\x80\x99s only happened 26 times, and only 10 clubs have ever achieved it, with Manchester United (8) and Liverpool (5) doing the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of the work. Sunderland (3), Arsenal (3), Everton (2), Sheffield United, Burnley, Blackburn Rovers, Chelsea and Manchester City are the others to have successfully made the transition from best losers to champs.</p> LONGEST UNBEATEN DUOS (II) <p>\xe2\x80\x9cGoing into last weekend\xe2\x80\x99s matches after five (or more) matches played, there were two Premier League teams still undefeated, three Bundesliga teams undefeated, a whopping five La Liga teams undefeated, and two Serie A teams undefeated,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Bob Zoellner. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the furthest/most matches played into a season in a league with more than one team still undefeated?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Last week we mentioned the 1998-99 Yugoslavian season but Eoin Byrne can do better than that. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I\xe2\x80\x99m not the only one to point this out,\xe2\x80\x9d begins the only person to point the following out, \xe2\x80\x9cbut both Porto and Benfica were undefeated after 28 games of the 2012-13 Portuguese league season. In fact, it came very close to both teams going undefeated.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn the penultimate game, Benfica headed to Porto two points clear at the top (P28 W23 D5 L0 Pts74, to Porto\xe2\x80\x99s P28 W22 D6 L0 Pts72) and things were going well for them when they took an 18th-minute lead. Porto quickly equalised though, and the game was level as it headed deep into the second half, leaving it quite possible that Porto could finish undefeated but still only second. A young Brazilian by the name of Kelvin went on to score a great 90th-minute winner, though, sending Porto a point clear at the top of the table with only one game to play, which needless to say they won away to Pacos de Ferreira. Benfica also won their game, so the only defeat either suffered was the defeat Benfica suffered at Porto.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou can see the goal here. The reaction of Jorge Jesus, the Benfica coach, is priceless.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>         Jorge!    <p>This is also a fine excuse to mention the famous 1967-68 tussle between Celtic and Rangers for the Scottish championship pennant. Admittedly it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really answer Bob Zoellner\xe2\x80\x99s question at all \xe2\x80\x93 Rangers beat newly crowned European champions Celtic 1-0 at Ibrox in mid-September - but the end-of-season records are still jaw-dropping, so what the hell. By the time the final games came round, the Old Firm had a combined record of played 66, won 57, drawn eight, lost one. Rangers went into their last match unbeaten, level on points with Celtic but well behind on goal average. Perhaps flummoxed at the prospect of failing to win the league after going an entire campaign undefeated, they succumbed at the final hurdle, 3-2 at home to Aberdeen, and Celtic won the title at Dunfermline a couple of days later. On the way home, Rangers striker Alex Ferguson was accosted by an upset Teddy Bear, who hoofed him in the shin. \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really blame him,\xe2\x80\x9d sighed Fergie years later. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt as sick as he did.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> WAITING FOR THE MAN <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOn 20 September 2014, Mikkel Andersen finally made his Reading debut against Sheffield Wednesday having joined the club on 26 January 2007,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Will Jones last week, as he built up to the big question: \xe2\x80\x9cHas another player had to wait so long to make their debut for their new club?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Thanks to you good, good people, Will hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had to suffer a similarly interminable wait for a response.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAfter looking back at teams during pre- and post-second world war, I found that England international John Aston Sr rose up through Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s ranks and joined the first team in December 1939,\xe2\x80\x9d begins Joseph Tesoriero. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he didn\xe2\x80\x99t make his debut until almost seven years later on 18 September 1946 against Chelsea, because of the war. He went on to win 17 caps for England and win the 1948 FA Cup.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of course! The war! We\xe2\x80\x99re going to up the ante with Billy Liddell, who joined Liverpool as an amateur on 27 July 1938, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn out in a full-blown fixture as a professional until 5 January 1946 in a 2-0 FA Cup win over Chester City. (Liddell scored, naturally.) But our guess is it won\xe2\x80\x99t take someone long to uncover another wartime example which trumps that. However Andersen, Aston and Liddell\xe2\x80\x99s waits are nothing compared to the Argentinian goalkeeper Alejandro Saccone.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSaccone is retired now,\xe2\x80\x9d reports Martin Laplace, \xe2\x80\x9cbut in a career that spanned 13 years, he played just six games, which might be some kind of record in itself. Anyway, he joined River Plate in 1993 and played his first (and only) game for the club on 3 June 2004, 11 years after signing up for the team. He enjoyed two on-loan stints in between.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAfter watching the Thierry Henry/Robert Pires penalty shambles, I was wondering if the Johan Cruyff/Jesper Olsen incident was the only previous example of the \xe2\x80\x98two-man penalty\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Lee McGleish back in 2005, just after the Arsenal pair had made spectacular clowns of themselves, albeit with the best aesthetic intentions in mind, against Manchester City.</p> <p>Well, Lee, despite Monsieur Henry admitting to having taken his inspiration from the Ajax pair\xe2\x80\x99s famous spot-kick in 1982, there are three far earlier examples of the cheeky \xe2\x80\x98tap penalty\xe2\x80\x99.</p> <p>On 21 November 1964, Plymouth Argyle beat Manchester City 3-2 in a Division Two game at Home Park. The winning goal came from Mike Trebilcock \xe2\x80\x93 after the referee gave the Pilgrims a penalty, Johnny Newman tapped the ball sideways, enabling Trebilcock to race in and fire home.</p> <p>Apparently, however, Argyle had already employed the trick once before. And some further digging reveals that Newman was involved again \xe2\x80\x93 on 6 February 1961, in the 5-3 League Cup fourth round, second replay defeat to Aston Villa. This time, Wilf Carter nudged the ball for him to run in and crash home.</p> <p>Yet the nearest variation to the \xe2\x80\x98two-touch\xe2\x80\x99 penalty can be tracked back even further; all the way to 5 June 1957 in fact, when Belgium entertained Iceland in a World Cup qualifying tie. Already leading 6-1, Belgium were awarded a 44th-minute penalty. Up stepped Rik Coppens to take it, but instead of firing towards Bj\xc3\xb6rgvin Hermannsson in the Iceland goal, Coppens nonchalantly passed to team-mate Andr\xc3\xa9 Piters, who returned the favour, enabling the former to score past a stunned Hermannsson. The match ended 8-3 and Coppens went on to be voted 73rd on a list of all-time great Belgians.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive.</p> CAN YOU HELP? <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBit of an odd question, but I live in New Zealand and we\xe2\x80\x99ve just had an election,\xe2\x80\x9d begins Chris Cherry. \xe2\x80\x9cOver the course of the current government\xe2\x80\x99s tenure, the PM John Key has made the most of the All Blacks\xe2\x80\x99 popularity. He\xe2\x80\x99s been taking pictures with individual All Blacks, selfies with captain Richie McCaw, and some of the All Blacks even tweeted support for him and the National party during the last election campaign. As an ex-pat, this all seems a bit weird to me, even after such a long time here, but it got me thinking. Although I can\xe2\x80\x99t think of any instances, have the England team or any members of it ever, or any other national team had such a chummy relationship with a ruling party, or for that matter, any political party?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first round of the 2014 NSW Premier League, Blacktown Spartans player Nathan Millgate scored a hat-trick in the Spartans\xe2\x80\x99 6-1 thrashing of the Sutherland Sharks,\xe2\x80\x9d begins Graham Clayton. \xe2\x80\x9cAll three of Millgate\xe2\x80\x99s goals were headers. Have there been any other examples of a player scoring a headed hat-trick in a game?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHibernian have lost the last 10 Scottish Cup finals they have played in, last winning it in 1902,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Paul Rudolph. \xe2\x80\x9cHave any other sides lost more consecutive finals of their country\xe2\x80\x99s major cup competition?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com.</p>'
