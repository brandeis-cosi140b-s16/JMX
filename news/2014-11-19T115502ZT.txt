b'The half-and-half scarf: nightmarish scourge or natty souvenir?'


b'<p>Half-and-half scarves seem to be a very modern kind of football phenomenon, perhaps one born out of the increase in neutrals and one-offers at big games. Even at the Scotland v England friendly at Celtic Park on Tuesday night, punters could pick up a knitted garment that enabled the wearer to proclaim that the sides were \xe2\x80\x9cTogether in friendship\xe2\x80\x9d (above), a statement that would have been quickly shown as overly-optimistic once inside the cauldron of Celtic Park.</p> <p>Also available outside the ground at the Argentina v Portugal friendly at Old Trafford was this little number:</p>     Messi v Ronaldo scarf.

Sadly for those preferring a more left-field candidate, a third-and-third-and-third scarf also featuring Thomas M\xc3\xbcller was disappointingly unavailable.</p> <p>Derby games are by no means immune. A Venn diagram of Liverpool and Everton supporters would have a minuscule crossover, yet you could buy one of these earlier this year:</p>     Liverpool v Everton half-and-half scarf.

It is a little like keeping your ticket stub as a souvenir. Perhaps harder to explain are the less glamorous fixtures.</p>     West Bromwich Albion v Southampton scarf.

Or are they harmless trinkets with the anti-half-and-half brigade misguidedly enraged by the crime of being young or naive?</p>     A young fan with a Weston-Super-Mare v Doncaster scarf.
