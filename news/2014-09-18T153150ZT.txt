b'The Fiver | His decision-making wasn\xe2\x80\x99t up to much'


b'\xe2\x80\xa6 AND SOLSKJAER HAS LOST IT <p>Not long ago \xe2\x80\x93 about nine months, to be precise \xe2\x80\x93 Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sitting smugly behind a table in Cardiff, getting unveiled as their new manager. Someone asked if he\xe2\x80\x99d learned much from Lord Ferg, the man who while both were at Manchester United taught him the incredible knack of scoring with wild abandon despite spending almost all of almost every match on the subs\xe2\x80\x99 bench. \xe2\x80\x9cI had the best teacher there can be,\xe2\x80\x9d he deadpanned. \xe2\x80\x9cSo of course I am looking through my diaries. I always used to write notes. I was a boring man, but a reflective man.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>His new employer was Vincent Tan, the red-obsessed, near-permanently-sunglassed, mustachioed Cardiff owner. Many words can and indeed have been used to describe Tan, but \xe2\x80\x9cboring\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9creflective\xe2\x80\x9d are not two of them. Nine months later Solskjaer has gone, citing a \xe2\x80\x9cdifference in philosophy\xe2\x80\x9d. His failure to spot this difference might be one of the things that Solskjaer has to reflect on this evening, boringly.</p> <p>He might also reflect about that time in May 2012 when Aston Villa called and asked if he\xe2\x80\x99d mind awfully if they made him their manager. He said he\xe2\x80\x99d rather not. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the right time,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained soon afterwards. \xe2\x80\x9cMy family didn\xe2\x80\x99t fancy moving and it would not have been right for me to come to the Premier League after winning two league titles.\xe2\x80\x9d Later that year he appeared on Blackeye Rovers\xe2\x80\x99 shortlist after the departure of Steve Kean-out and was by way of bonus linked with Bolton. \xe2\x80\x9cThere will always be speculation when someone in England needs a new manager,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at the time. \xe2\x80\x9cBolton\xe2\x80\x99s not for me. [These] rumours crop up all the time. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not that bothered about them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Towards the end of 2013, after Molde finished fifth in the league, 19 points behind champions Stromsgodset, his chairman suggested he might look for employment elsewhere. \xe2\x80\x9cFor Ole, it is obvious that this can be good timing if he wants to further his career,\xe2\x80\x9d prodded Tarje Nordstrand Jacobsen. Even so, he turned down Legia Warsaw and West Bromwich Albion. But when Cardiff City called in January, Solskjaer jumped. Turns out it was right for him to come to the Premier League after winning two league titles after all. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a fantastic challenge,\xe2\x80\x9d he correctly analysed. \xe2\x80\x9cCardiff are ready to take the next step up. I hope I can help them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Turns out Cardiff\xe2\x80\x99s next step would be down. Quite a long way down. Tonight they sit 17th in the Championship table, precisely one division lower than they were when he arrived, Solskjaer having helped them to five wins in 25 matches. Turns out his decision-making wasn\xe2\x80\x99t up to much, which everyone could probably have worked out from his career choices. The club, on reflection, should learn from this. The problem is, what they should learn is that anyone who wants to manage Cardiff City probably isn\xe2\x80\x99t the right kind of person to manage Cardiff City. The other problem is that, now Solskjaer\xe2\x80\x99s gone, the only reflective thing at Cardiff City is the owner\xe2\x80\x99s sunglasses.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Paul Doyle from 6pm BST for MBM coverage of Partizan Belgrade 1-1 Tottenham, followed at 8pm BST by Everton 1-2 Wolfsburg with Simon Burnton.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf in doubt, gifts shall not be offered or accepted.

As you\xe2\x80\x99re probably aware, we tend to be pretty insular here in the USA! USA!! USA!!! so we don\xe2\x80\x99t spend too much time thinking of matters outside of our borders. Second, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a horse in the race so I don\xe2\x80\x99t care whether the people of Scotland vote for independence or to remain part of whatever political entity they are currently a part of; I\xe2\x80\x99ve always enjoyed previous visits to Scotland and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure I will in the future. What I\xe2\x80\x99d like to know is how all of this impacts the Fiver. If Scotland votes for independence, will you start to cover the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s Newc O\xe2\x80\x99Rangers as though they are just another Montreal Impact or Orlando Pirates? Or will you continue to devote the same rigorous coverage to Scottish fitba as you currently do (which, as far as I can tell, consists of cutting and pasting the paragraph from the previous August Bank Holiday about the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Celtic\xe2\x80\x99s Big Cup elimination)?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 R Reisman.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: \xe2\x80\x98Greg Dyke\xe2\x80\x99s next plan is to ban clubs from signing cheap foreigners.\xe2\x80\x99 Given that, say, Xabi Alonso cost \xc2\xa38m and, say, Adam Lallana cost \xc2\xa320m-plus, are we sure it is the Premier League buying cheap foreign players that is the problem, rather than English players being ridiculously over-priced due to scarcity of supply and Premier League regulations artificially stimulating over-inflated demand? (Not the only thing that is over-inflated in this entire scenario, thinking about it)\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Kevin Carter.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI would like to join 1,056 other pedants in pointing out that Bild\xe2\x80\x99s player rating system is not \xe2\x80\x98maverick\xe2\x80\x99 (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver), but based on grading in German schools and so in fact rather conventional.
