b'The Fiver | Blame Kennedy Bakirciogl\xc3\xbc and Tonton Zola Moukoko'


b'AM/F R/L/C <p>It is an inescapable fact of life that in life, there are other people who must be met. And, even worse, it is also an inescapable fact of life that in life, there are other people who must be spoken to. This is bad.</p> <p>The reason that this is bad is because sometimes, other people say things which can be very difficult to listen to. There are, for example, those who insist on telling you about their dreams, fantastical and fabricated stories in which they suddenly become unstoppably interesting and engaging. Who could not enjoy tales of supernatural rollercoaster rides in which the hero makes passionate love to a combine harvester, shaped like Edwina Currie but fashioned from fizzy pink excrement, in front of a murderous crowd comprising Peter Rabbit and Pietro Vierchowod, surrounded by buildings made from glittering purple rubber that dance and sing and kill? Let us call them Type A.</p> <p>Yes, sometimes, other people say things which can be very difficult to listen to. There are, for example, those who insist on telling you about their football, for them, to be honest, at the end of the day, y\xe2\x80\x99know. Who could not enjoy tales of opinion, analysis and derring-do? Let us call them Type B.</p> <p>Of course, life being life, it is inevitable that Type A meets Type B, at a place commonly known as Football Manager - whereupon they form Type, er, C. And, naturally, they still cannot help but bestow the benefit of their experiences upon those with no interest in them whatsoever.</p> <p>As such, it is not remotely surprising to learn that Premier League clubs are to use data gathered from the aforementioned game \xe2\x80\x93 shovelled into the Prozone system without which Meisl, Stein, Busby, Shankly, Paisley, Michels, Menotti, Clough, and Ferguson would have been nothing. This news is a particular boon for those who think that football is mathematics: a jumble of numbers lumped together to produce a correct answer, and which counts as a form of communication. On the other hand, for those who think that football is football, this is rather less the case.</p> <p>The notion, it seems, is that this will aid the recruitment process - now furnished with its own structure, to include timetable, language, set pieces, cliches, jokes and \xe2\x80\x9cpersonalities\xe2\x80\x9d. Or, put another way, football now encompasses two discrete sports: the one called \xe2\x80\x9cfootball\xe2\x80\x9d, which involves people chasing a ball around, and the one called \xe2\x80\x9ctransfers\xe2\x80\x9d, which involves people chasing shrill tedium around.</p> <p>Kennedy Bakirciogl\xc3\xbc and Tonton Zola Moukoko have much for which to answer.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the manager now, so it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Boss\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98Gaffer\xe2\x80\x99. You\xe2\x80\x99ll still get the occasions when someone forgets and says \xe2\x80\x98Monks\xe2\x80\x99. But as soon as the fines come in it\xe2\x80\x99ll stop\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Swansea manager and former player Garry Monk outlines plans to make himself popular with a squad who used to be his team-mates.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel. Subscribe today! And there\xe2\x80\x99s also a new app for iOS and Android \xe2\x80\x93 details of the football offering are here.</p> RECOMMENDED VIEWING <p>Diego Maradona puts his hand of god to good use by slapping a journalist.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: possible future Ivory Coast president Didier Drogba (Friday\xe2\x80\x99s Quote of the Day). If he did manage to achieve this esteemed position, he would undoubtedly dive into the country\xe2\x80\x99s biggest challenges, review the falling currency and address the issue of corruption by weeding out the cheats. Thankfully funds could be immediately saved as Drogba will have no need for bodyguards. If any member of the population gets to within five metres of him, we can be assured he will immediately collapse poleaxed to the ground\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Steve Tallamy.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSo, one of the pedants wants referees to carry \xe2\x80\x98sophisticated lasers and trigonometry kits\xe2\x80\x99 on the pitch to properly set defenders for free-kicks (Friday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters)? As a certified ref, all I can say is \xe2\x80\x98Oof!\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m already carrying a watch, whistle, yellow and red cards, a book, a pen, and my vanishing/invisible spray and holster. I also generally carry a coin (for flipping before the match or to resolve tough calls), rosary beads (to gain strength for dealing with the managers), and a pocketful of \xe2\x80\x98Scooby snacks\xe2\x80\x99 (for my clicheed seeing-eye dog). And lest we forget, I\xe2\x80\x99m already dressed like a bumblebee or ladybird. Do I really need more high-tech gear? Will it make me run even slower behind the play? Dare I suggest STOP REF GEAR!?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Mike Wilner.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe solution to the variable referee 10-step pacing conundrum (Friday\xe2\x80\x99s letters) is surely to issue every arbiter with a Pace Stick. Apart from improving the reliability of wall-positioning, the bearing of a three-foot long, jointed, highly polished, brass-tipped length of stained and varnished tropical hardwood would add greatly to the authority of these fine men and women, as well as enhancing their powers of self-defence, particularly if the brass tips were sharpened\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Alec McAulay [Mike Wilner won\xe2\x80\x99t like that \xe2\x80\x93 Fiver Ed].</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was intrigued by Steve Hill\xe2\x80\x99s description of the modern referee as (quote) \xe2\x80\x98a man of varying height\xe2\x80\x99 (Friday\xe2\x80\x99s letter). Perhaps he\xe2\x80\x99d care to expand?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Steve Bennett.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cA few decades on, my hurt at being selected next-to-last, last, or (more usually) not at all, in playground games has more or less worn off. But after so many of their number have been picked by better clubs, what must the few remaining Southampton footballers be feeling? They\xe2\x80\x99ll be standing about awkwardly and trying to look nonchalant, but they\xe2\x80\x99ll be hurting. Once Morgan Schneiderlin leaves, they\xe2\x80\x99ll probably give up and pretend to be really interested in BMX bikes\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Charles Antaki.</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
