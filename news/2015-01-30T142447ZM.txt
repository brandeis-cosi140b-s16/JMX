b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini believes Diego Costa should change his on-field behaviour following the Chelsea striker\xe2\x80\x99s three-match ban for stamping on Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Emre Can.</p> <p>The sanction means the Brazilian will not be able to face Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s Manchester City side in Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s key Premier League match at Stamford Bridge. The champions enter the game five points behind Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side so know Costa\xe2\x80\x99s absence may offer them a better chance.</p> <p>On Friday morning the Football Association announced Costa will serve a three-game suspension for the stamp after he lost an appeal.</p> <p>Pellegrini believes Costa to be a fine centre-forward but does not need to use the game\xe2\x80\x99s dark arts. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a great player. A very important player,\xe2\x80\x9d said the City manager. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has his character, it is not an easy character but I hope for him, that this punishment, I am not trying to take advantage for the game tomorrow, I think it will be a good thing for him to change in the future because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to do it in that way because he is a very good player, a top player.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pressed if Pellegrini thinks Costa oversteps the mark, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI just give my opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>While the Chilean did not wish to speak about Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s current unhappiness \xe2\x80\x93 the Chelsea manager cancelled his Friday press conference and believes there is a \xe2\x80\x9ccampaign\xe2\x80\x9d from media and managers to influence referees decisions against his team \xe2\x80\x93 Pellegrini did aim a barb at Chelsea when defending his squad\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Abu Dhabi last week.</p> <p>City arrived back from the emirate less than 24 hours before losing to Middlesbrough in the FA Cup. Yet after Chelsea were also knocked out, by Bradford City, Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cAbout last week, about Abu Dhabi, another club that didn\xe2\x80\x99t travel to Abu Dhabi also lost in the FA Cup. It was not the reason we lost. This week was a normal week and we worked well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of Mourinho Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t try to do a conflicting press conference because I was not going to help with nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Samir Nasri and Eliaquim Mangala are doubts for the trip to Chelsea. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a small problem with Samir Nasri coming back, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he is 100% fit, we will see tomorrow with the doctor but he worked the last two days with the squad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pellegrini of the Frenchman, who is recovering from a calf injury. \xe2\x80\x9cMangala had a small problem with his shoulder today, we will see tomorrow. They are the only two small problems we have.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Scott Sinclair has been loaned to Aston Villa until the end of the season.</p>'
