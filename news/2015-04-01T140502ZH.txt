b'Hearts to feature Save the Children on shirts for next three seasons'


b'<p>The name of Save the Children will appear on the strips of Heart of Midlothian for the next three seasons, after the Edinburgh club announced an historic tie-up with the charity on Wednesday.</p> <p>A group of anonymous Hearts-supporting businesspeople contacted the club\xe2\x80\x99s owner, Ann Budge, several months ago with a view to offering financial support. The upshot was a unique deal whereby what Budge confirmed as a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant seven-figure sum\xe2\x80\x9d will be split between the charity and football club. Hearts will become the first UK side to carry the name of a worldwide charity on their home and away tops having rejected standard shirt-sponsorship opportunities.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe benefactors are wholly supportive of the way in which the club is being rebuilt and the values that underpin its activities,\xe2\x80\x9d said Budge.</p> <p>This marks the latest move in the restoration of Hearts\xe2\x80\x99 reputation after Budge bought the club from administration last year. That image had been tarnished under the Lithuanian businessman Vladimir Romanov when he was the owner at Tynecastle. The controversial payday loan company Wonga was Hearts\xe2\x80\x99 shirt sponsor prior to Budge\xe2\x80\x99s involvement.</p> <p>Last October, the club became the first in the British professional game to adopt the living wage for all employees. Chelsea have subsequently followed suit.</p> <p>Hearts will return to Scotland\xe2\x80\x99s top flight next season, having claimed the Championship at a canter while losing only one game to date.</p> <p>Neil Mathers, Save the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Scottish head of operations, said: \xe2\x80\x9cTo have our name on Heart of Midlothian FC\xe2\x80\x99s football shirts is an absolute honour \xe2\x80\x93 and a perfect match for our charity. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fantastic opportunity for Save the Children and will allow us to reach many more children across Edinburgh, helping them to get the best start in life and achieve their potential.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
