Here is a piece worth reading over your lunch break:</p> When Kevin Keegan went to Hamburg <p>In Kevin Keegan\xe2\x80\x99s three seasons in the Bundesliga he managed to win the Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or twice, play in the European Cup final against Nottingham Forest and release a top-10 smash hit</p>     Kevin Keegan.
