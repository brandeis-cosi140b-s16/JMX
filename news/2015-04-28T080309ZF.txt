b'Football transfer rumours: Eden Hazard to Real Madrid?'


b'<p>Smash capitalism now! That is the surprising rallying cry of Real Madrid, who have today taken to the streets with grubby clobber, scrawny dogs on tatty pieces of string and more home-brew cider than you could shake a didgeridoo at, as they kick off their campaign to return western society to the bartering system. What\xe2\x80\x99s it all in aid of? Exchanging Eden Hazard for Gareth Bale, if you please. You can see their logic but things could get complicated if Manchester United say they\xe2\x80\x99ll swap David De Gea for two Luka Modrics and half a Karim Benzema.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Edinson Cavani, the footballer most likely to star in the next Pirates of the Carribbean movie, has picked up a megaphone, climbed up the Eiffel Tower and, brazen as you like, announced his intention to move to United. The Mill may have sexed that story up a bit. A less salacious, more accurate account would be that French media organs are claiming that, fresh from hitting two goals against Lille last weekend in the absence of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Cavani has told Paris Saint-Germain that unless he gets to play at centre-forward rather than out wide on a regular basis, he\xe2\x80\x99ll seek a move this summer. Which is where United could come in.</p>  <p> Related: How Eden Hazard rolled with the punches to become Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s big hitter | Barney Ronay </p>   <p>Then again, Liverpool could come in there too, especially as they have a special fondness for Uruguayan players, thanks to Sebasti\xc3\xa1n Coates. But Brendan Rodgers, who only a couple of weeks ago sensationally came out as a realist, accepts Cavani is unlikely to choose Anfield over a Champions League venue, so has set his sights on Christian Benteke and Danny Ings instead, and will lure Alex Song to help supply that pair. </p> <p> Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger has finally figured out the final piece of the Arsenal jigsaw: the vital ingredient that his side has been lacking all these years is ... a nippy wide man. So off Wenger will pop to the Nou Camp again this summer, and back he\xe2\x80\x99ll come with Pedro. And maybe he\xe2\x80\x99ll stop off in Croydon on the way back to pick up Yannick Bolasie, too. Then if Liverpool still want Theo Walcott, they can have him. </p> <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s not just wide men that Wenger wants, of course. He also yearns for a world-class goal-getter, which which takes us back to where we came in. Or not. Because rather than pursue Cavani, Wenger has his heart set on luring Alexandre Lacazette from Lyon, who has plundered 26 goals* in 30 Ligue 1 matches the season. The Mill has stuck an asterisk there to remind itself to point out that seven of those 26 goals came from penalties and they should really be counted separately, just as if someone asks you how many cars you own, you should make it clear if your tally includes several that came in Kinder eggs.</p> <p>That is not to say Lacazette is plod. He is in fact very good. Which is why Manchester City, Bayern Munich and, for what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, Liverpool are also on his trail. And City are also determined to make Wenger think twice about holding on to Jack Wilshere, for whom City are said to be preparing an offer of around \xc2\xa330m. The best possible response to such an offer would be for Wenger, Ivan Gazidis, Stan Kroenke, Sir Chips Keswick and Lord Harris of Peckham to form themselves into a hiphop combo called Grandmaster Ars\xc3\xa8ne Arse and the Furious Five, and then exclaim: \xe2\x80\x9cAhhh, higher baby! Ahhh, go higher baby! Ahhh, go higher baby! And don\xe2\x80\x99t ever come down!\xe2\x80\x9d Failing that, they should take the money pronto and go buy Geoffrey Kondogbia. </p> <p> Staying in France ... is not something that Claudio Beauvue is likely to do. The 27-year-old Guingamp striker is being eyed up by West Bromwich Albion and Hull City, amongst others. The thing is, WBA might not make any bids until the club is sold this summer; Jeremy Peace is said to be in talks with several interested parties from Australia, the USA and China. </p> <p>Aston Villa want Bakary Sako. So do Wolves. Something has got to give, namely Villa \xe2\x80\x93 all that remains is to determine how much they have to give. Tim Sherwood also wants to happy-talk Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho into selling Patrick Bamford to Villa. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Brazilian sensation Nathan is close to completing a move to Chelsea, having passed a medical at the club. But he also watched Chelsea play at Arsenal on Sunday, and Porto hope that will have put him off and persuade him to sign for them instead.</p> <p>Internazionale are already snapping up the next generation of Belgian prodigies: they\xe2\x80\x99ve reached an agreement to bring 15-year-old Zinho Vanheusden to Italy from Standard Li\xc3\xa8ge as soon as the centre-back turns 16. At the other end of the spectrum, the Italian side are poised to sign Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 shortly after his 32nd birthday cake.</p> <p> Finally, Claudio Ranieri has expressed his interest in taking over at Marseille in the event of the entire club running out of patience with Marcelo Bielsa, whose relentlessly odd methods are really starting to grate now that the team\xe2\x80\x99s form has plummeted.</p>'
