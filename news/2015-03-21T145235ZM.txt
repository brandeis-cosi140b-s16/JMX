b'Manchester City 3-0 West Bromwich Albion | Premier League match report'


b'<p>The good news for Manchester City is that the gap at the top of the Premier League table has now been cut to three points, at least for a few hours. Slightly less encouraging was that in 90 minutes of target practice against a side reduced to 10 men virtually from the outset and barely able to get out of their own half, City were unable to overtake Chelsea in the goal difference column. Come the end of the season, if Manuel Pellegrini is to be believed and the leaders are going to drop points, such details could be important.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe are not thinking about Chelsea,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will not be playing them again this season so I will probably not even watch their game. Manchester United at Liverpool might be more useful. All we can do now is concentrate on our own games. I think Chelsea might drop points, but if they don\xe2\x80\x99t we could win all our remaining games and not win the title.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>City are not in a creative moment, according to Pellegrini, who made seven changes to the side beaten in Barcelona in midweek. What you need in such circumstances are visitors like West Bromwich Albion, who had taken a point more than City from league games in 2015 before this game kicked off, but lost a defender within 90 seconds of the match starting.</p> <p>Gareth McAuley was the unlucky early departee, unlucky because he was not the culprit when Wilfried Bony was tripped on the edge of the area on City\xe2\x80\x99s first attack. It was Craig Dawson who committed that foul, and though McAuley did arrive on the scene late, the position of the free-kick indicated that Neil Swarbrick had penalised the initial offence, seen it as a denial of a clear goalscoring opportunity, then sent off the wrong player.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSome referees would not see that as a red card. There was a similar incident in the Wolves-Derby game on Friday and the player was not even booked,\xe2\x80\x9d Tony Pulis said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut once he\xe2\x80\x99s decided it was a goal-scoring opportunity I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe he picked the wrong player. We all know it is a tough job but we can\xe2\x80\x99t keep moaning about referees. The time has come to help them with a system of referrals.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Swarbrick admitted to his error after the match via Professional Game Match Officials Limited, which said in a statement: \xe2\x80\x9cThe referee has confirmed the offence was caused by a different player, which should be addressed now as a case of mistaken identity. The referee has apologised for his error.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>That incident all but killed the contest even if it took City another 25 minutes to take the lead, with Frank Lampard shooting narrowly wide and David Silva bringing a flying save from Boaz Myhill while the game remained scoreless, but once they did the outcome was not in doubt.</p> <p>Fittingly, it was Bony, who might have scored after a minute, who put the home side ahead with his first goal since his \xc2\xa325m transfer from Swansea. City moved the ball along the edge of the area searching for an opportunity until Fernando went for goal and saw his shot half blocked. The ball went forward rather than back, and though it reached Bony at an awkward height the striker stayed onside, brought it down well and finished from the six-yard line with his usual vigour.</p> <p>City\xe2\x80\x99s attempts on goal tally moved beyond 20 before half-time, with West Brom allowing Joe Hart a rest after his midweek heroics by failing to register a single effort, on target or otherwise. Not all of the home side\xe2\x80\x99s attacks were incisive, it was more a case of shots from distance being blocked by a packed defence or saved by the goalkeeper, until the second goal arrived courtesy of a mix-up between Myhill and Jonas Olsson.</p> <p>When Eliaquim Mangala took out a defender to reach a Jes\xc3\xbas Navas corner the goalkeeper appeared to have the loose ball covered, only for Olsson to scoop it out of his arms at the last moment to present Fernando with a chance he could hardly miss. It was the sort of defending to keep a coach awake at night and Pulis cut a disconsolate figure on the sideline in the minutes before the interval, frequently turning away or kicking the ground in frustration.</p> <p>Myhill helped keep the score respectable with two excellent saves from Silva and Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero early in the second half, before Lampard set him an easier task with an underhit shot after Silva had picked up his run with a clever pass. By the time the hour came up City were finding ever more creative ways not to score.</p> <p>Ag\xc3\xbcero hit the post and Bony the bar on the same attack, before Navas crashed in a shot from a narrow angle to bring another fine save. That was something like City\xe2\x80\x99s 36th attempt on goal, and the traffic was so one-way that when West Brom finally won a corner after 65 minutes their supporters leapt to their feet in ironic celebration. Had Saido Berahino pulled a goal back shortly afterwards, instead of heading against the bar from a corner, the home side might have been seriously embarrassed; instead the chance was missed and Stevan Jovetic came on to make the margin of victory more flattering with a shot from the edge of the area that Silva managed to help into the net.</p>'
