b'Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend'


b'1) Chelsea more likely to batten down the hatches than attack <p>There is a mysterious Chelsea chant, in which the Shed End profess their love of the club. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all follow the Chelsea, over land and sea,\xe2\x80\x9d they bellow before, for reasons no one really understands, yelling \xe2\x80\x9cAnd Leicester!\xe2\x80\x9d A win against Arsenal on Sunday, would mean that Chelsea could clinch the Premier League title at the King Power Stadium on Wednesday evening which, at the very least, might give a nonsensical chant some meaning at last. But somehow it seems unlikely as Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho will be just as happy with a draw at the Emirates. Yes, there is the headline stat that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger has not beaten Mourinho in 12 attempts in the league. There is also the fact that Chelsea have not lost a league match to Manchester United, City, Arsenal or Liverpool since Mourinho returned to the club in 2013, but that does not mean Chelsea have won all those matches, or even come close. Chelsea have issues up front: Diego Costa, Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my and Didier Drogba are all in various states of crockedness, while it will be interesting to see how Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas deals with the abuse he will face on his return to Arsenal. With Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s side playing so well at the moment, Mourinho is likely to adopt a similarly defensive approach to that which he took against Manchester United last Saturday. The results of that could lead to another match like the 0-0 these two sides played out on 23 December 2013. This one may not be quite the thrilling title decider some are billing it.

You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to miss this match! This has the makings of a momentous clash between two teams \xe2\x80\x93 Leicester and Burnley \xe2\x80\x93 with exceptional work rates and urgent requirements for points. Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s need is greater and to win they will need to find a way to supply Danny Ings with enough chances to end his eight-match goal drought, with the suspension of Ashley Barnes unlikely to help. Leicester, on the other hand, have relatively little trouble creating chances, with Esteban Cambiasso, Jamie Vardy, Riyad Mahrez, Marc Albrighton and Jeffrey Schlupp all apt to attack from a variety of positions. Mostly their problem this season has been converting their opportunities but in recent matches they have finally shot with more precision, and last week Leonardo Ulloa ended a barren streak even longer than Ings\xe2\x80\x99 current one. If Nigel Pearson sticks with the high-octane direct approach that has brought his team three successive wins, then Leicester could blast their way closer to a sensational escape from the drop zone. But don\xe2\x80\x99t write off a Burnley victory that would add even more intrigue to the relegation battle. Paul Doyle</p>  <li>Nigel Pearson: \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t like all I am but you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to live with it\xe2\x80\x99</li> <li>Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger \xe2\x80\x98surprised\xe2\x80\x99 by Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s quality - video </li>  3) Sherwood will need more than confidence at Manchester City <p>Tim Sherwood is often praised for speaking his mind, for avoiding cliches and is occasionally called, by those on whom all forms of irony are presumably lost, no-nonsense. Yet even he will find it difficult to avoid such pitfalls this week. The problem he faces is a familiar one. Strugglers spring a surprise in the FA Cup but must revert their gaze to their league travails. There may be plenty of different ways to say \xe2\x80\x9cone game at a time\xe2\x80\x9d but it will be impossible to keep his players\xe2\x80\x99 minds off Wembley. To make matters worse, they will run into a Manchester City side who rediscovered some of their swagger against an albeit woeful West Ham side last weekend, with Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero\xe2\x80\x99s goal a particular highlight. They are not without their own problems \xe2\x80\x93 Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s days appear numbered and Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s future is similarly bleak \xe2\x80\x93 but Sherwood will need more than his huge levels of self-confidence to conjure anything from the Etihad. Jack Grealish and Charles N\xe2\x80\x99Zogbia will be marked men having had the run of Wembley and Ron Vlaar is in for a busy evening if Ag\xc3\xbcero is in the mood. Sherwood called City the best team on the planet after they dismantled his Tottenham side 5-1 at White Hart Lane in January 2014, bringing him back down to earth after he had started his tenure with six unbeaten league matches. Few would give City similar acclaim at present but it\xe2\x80\x99s a safe bet they will burst another of Sherwood\xe2\x80\x99s bubbles.

His shadow still lingers over this fixture. Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s performance at Goodison Park last year was their worst in the league all season. It was also a display that cast his successor at Everton into a flattering light and Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez drew plaudits for being the anti-Moyes \xe2\x80\x93 all positivity, attacking intent and verve \xe2\x80\x93 plaudits that he has struggled to live up to this season. Both sides arrive at this fixture in form, with each having lost just one of their last six and Everton not having lost at home this year. Manchester United will be happier to use the Moyes era as a reminder of what not to do but Everton could learn a lesson from their former manager\xe2\x80\x99s approach to this fixture. Between 2008 and his departure from Goodison, Moyes lost just once to Manchester United at home. A result like that could be the springboard from which Everton can dominate a reasonably simple run-in.

Fans boycotted the match against Spurs and are planning to boycott this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s game against Swansea as well. There have been record profits of \xc2\xa318.7m but nothing spent to reinforce a team that was left with only 13 fit outfield players last month. A makeshift manager has been hung out to dry. This is not what Newcastle used to be. This is not what people once swarmed up to Gallowgate for, breathing names like Keegan, Beardsley, Gascoigne and Sir Bobby, or Supermac, Waddle, Milburn and Moncur. They lie 14th in the table with five to play, but three of those below them with a game in hand. There is a chance that Newcastle could go down \xe2\x80\x93 this current side, on current form, may well deserve it too. There are fans who, despite themselves, might welcome it. Blood the youth in the Championship, learn to compete again, try to win, and hope against hope the owner loses interest and abandons them. When did supporting Newcastle turn into this?

So any hostility shown to him by Southampton fans on Saturday on his first return to St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s since defecting to Spurs is unlikely to bother Pochettino. Far better to greet him warmly for doing well for the club for a season or, if that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mesh with your concept of fandom, shun him until the final whistle, whereupon, if Southampton have won and thus gone a good way towards finishing above Spurs, the home crowd could point in unison at their former manager and give a Nelson-from-the-Simpsons style \xe2\x80\x9chaha\xe2\x80\x9d, repeatedly. Whether Southampton will depends to a large degree on how well Christian Eriksen and Harry Kane do against the home side\xe2\x80\x99s defence, which has been the biggest area of improvement under Ronald Koeman this season. If Toby Alderweireld is fit, that would be an obvious boon. And if Roy Hodgson is in attendance, he might like to compare and contrast the performances of the teams\xe2\x80\x99 left-backs and ask himself what he was thinking last month when he seemingly ranked Danny Rose above Ryan Bertrand in the England pecking order. PD</p>  <li>Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s Pochettino: avoiding Europa League could help us </li>  7) Rodgers must raise Liverpool spirits to avoid clear-out <p>Perhaps Brendan Rodgers should tell his Liverpool players that this is a meaningless mid-table clash, just in case the pressure of chasing an important win makes them freeze. A dud performance against West Bromwich Albion and a drippy end to the Premier League campaign would, following last week\xe2\x80\x99s anaemic FA Cup semi-final defeat and the chastening league losses to Manchester United and Arsenal, certainly accentuate the sense that the club is not progressing as it should. So if Rodgers wants to make sure that he is not cleared out along with the litter of players who must be discarded in the summer, then he could do with getting his team to produce a strong finish to the season and clinch fifth in the table, which would be a par league performance for Liverpool in their current state. PD</p>  <li>Rodgers rejects Klopp talk as Liverpool already have best man</li>  8) Will Sunderland fans regret their hubris? <p>It takes a special kind of hubris to fly a jeering banner over the ground of your nearest rivals when you sit six points below them in the table. When you have lost four of your last six, have replaced your manager with another who does not stand much chance of keeping the job for long, there are times when it is best to keep your counsel. It\xe2\x80\x99s why most Sunderland fans were appalled by last weekend\xe2\x80\x99s stunt and have urged focus at Stoke, a side pushing for their highest ever Premier League finish. Stoke\xe2\x80\x99s striker Mame Biram Diouf has scored in each of his last three home games but the team have stuttered somewhat as they near the end of their campaign. Three defeats and two wins in their last six means Stoke could be there for the taking but are Sunderland the team to take them? TB</p>  <li>Advocaat \xe2\x80\x98very worried\xe2\x80\x99 after Sunderland defeat by Crystal Palace</li>  9) QPR must battle right to the end <p>QPR are staring down the barrel of relegation and if the league began in January, West Ham would be in similar strife. This does not have the hallmarks of a classic, rather another feisty London derby for Rangers, who have not played since their late defeat to Chelsea two weeks ago. West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s problems are manifold, not least off the pitch where the Olympic Stadium saga rumbles on and their owners continue to court managers who are not Sam Allardyce. QPR\xe2\x80\x99s troubles meanwhile, are easier to pinpoint, as their former manager Harry Redknapp has done this week \xe2\x80\x93 they cannot stop conceding in the latter stages of matches. Since the start of February, late goals against Southampton, Hull, Aston Villa and Chelsea have been costly. Without them, Chris Ramsey\xe2\x80\x99s side would be 16th. A timely boost arrives this weekend however, in the shape of Leroy Fer, who returns to the side after two months out with a knee injury and will add steel to the midfield as well as a goalscoring threat to ease the burden on Charlie Austin. All four of the Dutchman\xe2\x80\x99s league goals this season have directly contributed to points for QPR and having found the net in his most recent outing against Sunderland in February, Ramsey will be desperate his key midfielder picks up from where he left off. GM</p>  <li>Question of state aid still lingers over West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s new home</li> <li>West Ham blow their season-ticket trumpets but who pays for the tune?</li>            Sam Allardyce says West Ham must improve as the season draws towards its finale.    10) Have Hull made use of their fortnight off? <p>Hull City have not won in six matches and their current form is the second worst in the Premier League. Their manager, Steve Bruce, dropped the goalkeeper Allan McGregor when his side visited Southampton, citing a lack of confidence, and replaced him with a 40-year-old, Steve Harper. Afterwards he bemoaned a bluntness in attack, fretting that the side had created chances but had failed to convert them. So, problems at the back, problems up front, issues with confidence and a side out of rhythm. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look good for Hull, who sit outside the relegation zone by dint of a single goal. A win against resurgent Crystal Palace is nothing less than essential as Hull\xe2\x80\x99s run-in is particularly tough. They face Liverpool and Arsenal after Palace, before a crucial match against Burnley is followed by Tottenham and Manchester United. Hull have had two weeks without a match so should return for the last leg of their campaign refreshed. But they will also need to show the same sort of hunger their manager is presumably suffering since his recent promise to go on a crash diet if they are to get out of this mess. TB</p>  <li>Bruce remains optimistic as Hull City continue slide</li> '
