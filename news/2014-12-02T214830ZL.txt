b'Leicester City 1-3 Liverpool: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>How things stand: That makes it nine without a win for Leicester, who will remain bottom of the table after tonight\xe2\x80\x99s reverse. Liverpool are in eighth after tonight, just 13 points off the Premier League summit. They did well this evening against game, but limited oppositions. Their propensity for howlers at the back remains very much in place, but an away win when the chips are down is not to be scoffed at. </p>'
