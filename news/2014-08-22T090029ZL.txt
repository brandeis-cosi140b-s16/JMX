b'La Liga 2014-15 preview: Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid both champions and underdogs | Sid Lowe'


b'<p>There was something missing when Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid finally, unexpectedly won the league again after 18 long years. While the players celebrated the title at the Camp Nou on the final day of the 2013-14 season, the trophy was 600km away, hidden away somewhere in the Liga de F\xc3\xbatbol Profesional (LFP) offices in the capital. It is still there three months later and when it is at last presented to Diego Simeone\xe2\x80\x99s team before their second league game \xe2\x80\x93 against Eibar next week \xe2\x80\x93 it won\xe2\x80\x99t be the same.</p> <p>However, Spain\xe2\x80\x99s outstanding goalkeeper will not be there to lift it. Thibaut Courtois, like the full back Filipe Lu\xc3\xads, left for Chelsea. Atl\xc3\xa9tico\xe2\x80\x99s top scorer has gone too. So, in fact, has their second top scorer: Diego Costa and David Villa both departed, taking 40 league goals with them. Of the 11 players who started against Barcelona on 17 May, six left, although the Portuguese midfielder Tiago found himself without a team and came back again. Some who lift the trophy, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t; some who should will no longer be there to do so.</p> <p>For Atl\xc3\xa9tico fans, what happened next felt depressingly inevitable. They\xe2\x80\x99d got the draw they needed to win the league at the Camp Nou, just as they\xe2\x80\x99d won at the Bernab\xc3\xa9u, San Mam\xc3\xa9s, Mestalla, the S\xc3\xa1nchez Pizju\xc3\xa1n, San Siro and Stamford Bridge. On the final whistle at the Camp Nou, their 11 players cost under \xe2\x82\xac40m. They\xe2\x80\x99d overcome the odds and the inequality, a budget a fifth the size of their rivals which saw them annually trail Real and Bar\xc3\xa7a by over \xe2\x82\xac400m, and they had buried El Pupas \xe2\x80\x93 they were no longer the jinxed ones.</p> <p>But seven days on, a 92nd minute equaliser cost them the Champions League trophy to a resurgent Real Madrid. An astonishing title win had been overtaken, all the more so in a country where the fanbase and media agenda too is dominated by Real and Barcelona, where those financial differences reflect a social reality. And their reward for having the temerity to take on the big two was the destruction of their team.</p> <p>It was not just Atl\xc3\xa9tico: for the rest of Spain, there was a sad inevitability about it too. Atl\xc3\xa9tico had been the first club to break the duopoly in a decade. Going back 10 years, the distance between the best of the \xe2\x80\x9crest\xe2\x80\x9d and the top of the table had been 24 in 2012-13, then 39, 25, 28, 17, 8 (in a season where Villarreal came second), 5, 13 and 19 points. Perhaps there could be a third way, after all? After the final in Lisbon, Simeone was asked what he was going to do next. \xe2\x80\x9cHave a break, watch the World Cup and then prepare to defend the league title we have just won,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied pointedly.</p>         Watch Andy Brassell\xe2\x80\x99s five things to look out for in La Liga this season    <p>That seemed even more unlikely now. The exodus began, led by arguably Atl\xc3\xa9tico\xe2\x80\x99s best two players. Meanwhile, no one doubted that Madrid and Barcelona would invest heavily to ensure that this never happened again. Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez and James Rodr\xc3\xadguez arrived, for upwards of \xe2\x82\xac75m apiece. It was as if someone had tapped Atl\xc3\xa9tico on the shoulder and said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve had your fun. Now, get back in line.\xe2\x80\x9d As if they had said: \xe2\x80\x9cNice shot, David. Now hand over the catapult.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>This week, Simeone insisted that Atl\xc3\xa9tico are competing with Sevilla and Valencia, not Bar\xc3\xa7a and Real. Yet few swallowed it this time. Simeone had said that winning the league was \xe2\x80\x9cimpossible\xe2\x80\x9d last year, remember. This time, some suspect he is merely playing a role that worked well. That early pessimism has gone. Because here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing: Atl\xc3\xa9tico may even have got better.</p> <p>At \xe2\x82\xac30m Antoine Griezmann became Atl\xc3\xa9tico\xe2\x80\x99s second most expensive player ever after Radamel Falcao when he joined from Real Sociedad. (Falcao had been bought and sold with the help of a third party, bringing his fee to Atl\xc3\xa9tico down in exchange for over half of the player\xe2\x80\x99s registration rights.) Griezmann\xe2\x80\x99s signing was a golpe de efecto: a statement of intent that changed the mood. Giddy fans flocked to the Calder\xc3\xb3n for his presentation.</p> <p>Others came too. Mario Mandzukic cost \xe2\x82\xac22m from Bayern Munich. Jan Oblak arrived for \xe2\x82\xac16m, Ra\xc3\xbal Jim\xc3\xa9nez and Guilherme Siqueira cost \xe2\x82\xac10m each, Correa \xe2\x82\xac7.5m, Miguel \xc3\x81ngel Moy\xc3\xa0 \xe2\x82\xac3.5m and Jes\xc3\xbas G\xc3\xb3mez \xe2\x82\xac2.5m. Cristian Ansaldi came on loan. Nineteen-year-old Sa\xc3\xbal has returned from his loan spell at Rayo Vallecano, where he was superb.</p> <p>There are still 10 days left, Simeone says there will probably be more movement, and Atl\xc3\xa9tico have already spent almost \xe2\x82\xac100m. So far, that puts them only \xe2\x82\xac20m behind Real. The change is radical. No one in last season\xe2\x80\x99s squad cost over \xe2\x82\xac12m and, indebted to the tax man, their spending had plummeted. Of those signed in the previous three years, only Toby Alderweireld (\xe2\x82\xac5m), Villa (\xe2\x82\xac2m) and L\xc3\xa9o Baptist\xc3\xa3o (\xe2\x82\xac7m) cost anything. Now they are spending again. Simeone demanded it; the Champions league campaign and \xe2\x82\xac85m in sales permitted it.</p> <p>Atl\xc3\xa9tico are adapting to Mandzukic, the new focal point of their attack. His movement is not the same as Costa\xe2\x80\x99s: that quick ball into his runs either side of the central defenders, from Koke particularly, was central to their gameplan last season but will not function in the same way now. Simeone, though, believes that Mandzukic can facilitate the quick arrival in the area of those in the line behind him, Griezmann in particular.</p>     Diego Simeone says Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid could see even more transfer activity before the summer window closes. Photograph: Manuel Blondeau/Corbis    <p>Elsewhere, the ideas remain similar. Not every player who could have departed did so. Koke chose to stay, while Simeone declared: \xe2\x80\x9cI would never sell [Diego] God\xc3\xadn.\xe2\x80\x9d They, like Gabi, Jo\xc3\xa3o Miranda, Arda Turan and Ra\xc3\xbal Garc\xc3\xada remain. \xe2\x80\x9cThe structure of the team is not going to change. Stability comes with maintaining the same ideas: intensity and aggressiveness will continue to be the basis,\xe2\x80\x9d Simeone said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a clear idea of how we want to play,\xe2\x80\x9d added the captain Gabi.</p> <p>In pre-season they conceded just one goal. Their competitive debut was at the Bernab\xc3\xa9u against Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup on Tuesday night and \xe2\x80\x9ccompetitive\xe2\x80\x9d is the word. A word, anyway. It finished 1-1; the second leg is [on Friday at the Calder\xc3\xb3n. Both sides start their league season on Monday night, Atl\xc3\xa9tico at Rayo and Real at home against C\xc3\xb3rdoba.</p> <p>It would be unrealistic to consider Atl\xc3\xa9tico favourites for the title, but then it appeared unrealistic last season and even more realistic in the aftermath of defeat in Lisbon, as the apparent dismantling began. Real Madrid and Barcelona have of course strengthened significantly, with the latter undergoing a major overhaul. The big two will again start the season as favourites and Atl\xc3\xa9tico know that. They admit that. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that they continue to play on that. Almost \xe2\x82\xac100m later, it is harder to play the Robin Hood card, though.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone expects us to fall or to drop our guard but we have proven we\xe2\x80\x99re capable of anything,\xe2\x80\x9d Gabi told AS. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have found ourselves a place between two teams with more resources than us. We have to keep that place. It is hard for us to repeat what happened last season and it is harder for us to win the league than for Madrid or Bar\xc3\xa7a to do so. People will always demand more because of what we have done but we know the monsters we have in front of us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWith \xe2\x82\xac95m, we sign eight players. Real Madrid sign two,\xe2\x80\x9d Simeone said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a small difference, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d It is. It is also a smaller difference than anyone expected.</p>'
