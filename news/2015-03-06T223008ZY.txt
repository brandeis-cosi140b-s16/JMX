b'Yakubu Aiyegbeni powers Reading\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup run and chases elusive honours'


b'<p>In the first half of this season, Yakubu Aiyegbeni was playing for Al-Rayyan in the second division of the Qatari league. It was not supposed to be like that when he joined from Guangzhou R&amp;F in January 2014, midway through the Qatari season, but the club would suffer a dramatic last-day relegation.</p> <p>Life was certainly different in Qatar, as it was in China, where Yakubu had spent the previous 18 months and one aspect of it remains seared on to his consciousness. It was hot. Boy, was it hot. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had to train at 9.30 at night,\xe2\x80\x9d Yakubu says. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d finish training at about midnight, go home at one-ish and then go to bed at about four. You have to stay home all day because it is really, really hot and you cannot train in the morning or afternoon.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Brendan Rodgers dismisses Manchester City link and puts Liverpool first </p>   <p>Yakubu came to feel that it was time to get out of the kitchen and a career that has been characterised by wanderlust, particularly in its latter years, now has a fresh port. The Nigerian striker signed a deal at Reading on 2 February until the end of the season and, rather abruptly, he is eyeing Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup quarter-final at Bradford City and the fulfilment of a dream.</p> <p>Yakubu never played at Wembley during the nine-and-a-half seasons he previously spent in England \xe2\x80\x93 with Portsmouth, Middlesbrough, Everton, Leicester City and Blackburn Rovers \xe2\x80\x93 but victory over the League One team would get him there for the semi-final and, who knows, possibly the final too.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was there at Wembley for the 2009 FA Cup final with Everton [which they lost to Chelsea] but I was injured, I was out for nine months with a ruptured achilles,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was crazy. When you\xe2\x80\x99re watching from the side, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite different. We have the chance now to do it and, if we could, it would be great.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Yakubu is itching to be involved for Steve Clarke\xe2\x80\x99s team, having started one Championship game since his arrival as a free agent. Initially, he lacked fitness but he and his manager now feel that he is in good condition. He has been an unused substitute three times and his one goal came in the previous round of the cup, when he came on to score the winner at Derby County.</p> <p>Yakubu has played at the highest level; he first came to prominence in the Champions League at Maccabi Haifa and he appeared at the 2010 World Cup, scoring a penalty in Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s final group game against South Korea.</p> <p>Clubs have paid big money for him, most notably Middlesbrough (\xc2\xa37.5m) and Everton (\xc2\xa311.25m) and he has 96 Premier League goals, which puts him just ahead of Ruud Van Nistelrooy and Dimitar Berbatov at 26th on the all-time list, and clear of Dennis Bergkamp, Fernando Torres and Cristiano Ronaldo.</p> <p>Yakubu, though, wants to gild the final years of his career with rich experiences and he has stories to tell from Qatar and China. \xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, Qatar can host a good World Cup,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have nice stadiums. But when it is hot, it is really hot.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t train when it\xe2\x80\x99s 50C. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we had to train at night. In the winter, it is less hot. We could train at four o\xe2\x80\x99clock. We\xe2\x80\x99d play matches at about eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock and then they\xe2\x80\x99d have to stop one or two times for water breaks. Would a summer World Cup have been crazy? Not crazy but it is hot. Thinking about the fans who come over to watch \xe2\x80\xa6 it is so difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>China sounds like a culture shock. Yakubu scored the winner on his debut in the derby against Marcello Lippi\xe2\x80\x99s Guangzhou Evergrande but, in general, there was not the intensity he was used to from England. Crowds were sometimes as low as 5,000 and rarely higher than 20,000.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to switch your mentality,\xe2\x80\x9d Yakubu says. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to scrap where you play in your head. The atmosphere is different. In Liverpool, if you lose the derby you do not want to go out, but you can still go out in China.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Yakubu talks about the lack of attention away from the field and how it was welcome. He sometimes went unnoticed. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a football player, you want your privacy,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.</p> <p>Communication, though, was the challenge, and not only when he ventured out, with every destination on his phone to show to taxi drivers. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had a Brazilian manager [S\xc3\xa9rgio Farias], who spoke Portuguese and there were two guys who had to translate him into English and Chinese,\xe2\x80\x9d Yakubu says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe manager might be supposed to speak for five minutes but you are there for double that, with the translating.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was also difficult to speak to some of my team-mates, because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak English. You don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to tell them to pass the ball. I would just scream at them and, when I screamed, they knew that they had to give me the ball.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Gabriel Agbonlahor reignites a curious career to give Aston Villa hope| Stuart James </p>   <p>Yakubu found it easier when Farias was replaced as the manager by Sven\xe2\x80\x91G\xc3\xb6ran Eriksson, who he had worked with at Leicester. \xe2\x80\x9cSven has stayed the same person, he never changes,\xe2\x80\x9d Yakubu says. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is one of the best managers I have worked with. He is really calm. He put the pressure on me in his own way. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say: \xe2\x80\x98You have to score.\xe2\x80\x99 He\xe2\x80\x99d just come over and say, with a smile: \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s been a while since you scored.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Eriksson\xe2\x80\x99s gentle persuasion contrasted with the more upfront style of Harry Redknapp, the manager who brought Yakubu to England from Haifa in January 2003, when he was in charge at Portsmouth.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHarry makes you believe that you can kill a defender, even when you play against the big teams,\xe2\x80\x9d Yakubu says. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re scared, like if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to play against, say, Sol Campbell, Harry would say: \xe2\x80\x98Sol Campbell? He\xe2\x80\x99s shit. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Yakubu rates his former Portsmouth team-mate Teddy Sheringham as the best striker that he has played with. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was unbelievable, he always made you believe,\xe2\x80\x9d Yakubu says, although his self-belief has long come from within. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a striker, all my life, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been under pressure,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is how you deal with it. I am always confident.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It is remarkable to think that Yakubu is still only 32 and, frankly, not everyone believes he is. David Moyes probably did not help the situation when, as Yakubu\xe2\x80\x99s manager at Everton in 2008, he described him as being \xe2\x80\x9conly 25, albeit a Nigerian 25\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt does not bother me,\xe2\x80\x9d Yakubu says. \xe2\x80\x9cKanu has had it as well. I just laugh about it. People make a joke and that is it. If I was lying about my age, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I would be playing now. I would be retired already.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Before he does call it a day, Yakubu wants to win something. Apart from Israeli titles in 2001 and 2002 with Haifa, plus the Championship with Portsmouth in 2003, the cupboard is bare. \xe2\x80\x9cI think trophies are missing from my career,\xe2\x80\x9d Yakubu says. \xe2\x80\x9cOne more would be great.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
