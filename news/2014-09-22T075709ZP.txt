b'Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend\xe2\x80\x99s action | Guardian writers'


b'1) Time for some praise for Leicester <p>Apologies if you want to read more about Manchester United - another post-mortem, further questions about the defence and the merits of spending \xc2\xa3150m in the summer without replacing Rio Ferdinand or Nemanja Vidic. Forgive me for deciding to heap some praise onto Leicester City instead. Nigel Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s side have played three of last season\xe2\x80\x99s top five - Everton, Chelsea, Arsenal - plus United in their opening five games: a daunting fixture list for any team, let alone a newly-promoted club. With that in mind, it seems particularly impressive that they have picked up eight points already. In Leonardo Ulloa, they have a powerful goalscoring focal point up front \xe2\x80\x93 it is now five goals in five games for the Argentinian \xe2\x80\x93 while Esteban Cambiasso, his countryman, has added a touch of class and experience to central midfield. Then there is Jamie Vardy\xe2\x80\x99s aggressive running. Probably one of the most refreshing things about Leicester, though, is that Pearson is encouraging attacking football, trying to win games, no matter the opposition, rather than look to pinch a draw. That approach will not always work for them in the way it did against United, where they got a couple of breaks, but it guarantees entertaining football and, if the early results are anything to by, Leicester will pick up their fair share of points along the way.

Cue some surprise at Upton Park on Saturday, then, at the sight of two teams playing with two forwards each. For West Ham it was Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia, while Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s front pair consisted of two Italians in Mario Balotelli and Fabio Borini. Their fortunes contrasted wildly, with Sakho and Valencia a constant menace to the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 backline \xe2\x80\x93 the former scored with a superb chip after just seven minutes \xe2\x80\x93 while Balotelli and Borini were consistent pictures of frustration. Yet it was equally interesting seeing both operate in tandem as well as with the rest of their team-mates, and with Manchester United likely to also operate with two strikers for large parts of the season, this could become a growing trend in the Premier League.</p>           West Ham were outstanding in win over Liverpool, says Sam Allardyce    <p>Liverpool, of course, often played with two strikers during the previous campaign, with Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez and Daniel Sturridge contributing greatly to the team\xe2\x80\x99s staggering haul of 101 goals. When Su\xc3\xa1rez departed to Barcelona it was presumed Brendan Rodgers would revert to a 4-3-3 formation, but the arrival of Balotelli indicates he will stick with a front-two and a diamond midfield. That was the formation West Ham also used to devastating effect at the weekend, with Stewart Downing excelling against his former side in a position just behind the front two. Having come under pressure last season to make West Ham more expansive, their manager Sam Allardyce may well have found the perfect solution. When it comes to formations and systems there is no one right answer, but for traditionalists and those who simply like seeing as many goalscorers on the pitch as possible, an increase in the number of teams using strike partnerships will undeniably be welcomed. Quick, someone call for Emile Heskey.

Help may be at hand though. Vincent: meet Eliaquim. You two are going to hit it off, I can just feel it. Aged 23 and with three years at Porto behind him, Mangala is hardly an unknown quality. Still, his signing may have raised a few eyebrows during the summer: \xc2\xa332m is a lot of money for anybody, let alone a tyro centre back. Lower them, though. Lower those eyebrows. Mangala not only made his full debut for City at the Etihad in a bruising 1-1 draw, marred not by the tactical approach of either team but by the subsequent bleating over some fairly reasonable refereeing decisions (odd that such a robust game of football should end in shrill cries of illusory injustice). Mangala also played superbly well alongside Kompany, providing perhaps the most assured peg in City\xe2\x80\x99s defence in a spiky game that saw Diego Costa, as he will, disrupt and discomfit the home team.</p>     Eliaquim Mangala, centre, upends Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Diego Costa during what was an impressive debut for the Man City defender. Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images    <p>Throughout Mangala was purposeful and unruffled. He is a great, ripping, beefy-shouldered specimen, similar in proportions to Kompany himself, providing City with surely the most imposing defensive partnership in the Premier League, plus also some youthful speed and agility to go alongside Kompany\xe2\x80\x99s know-how. The lack of a real change of pace may be the most obvious weakness in a team of considerable strengths (a new star attacker, to go with the well-worn Ag\xc3\xbcero-Dzeko-Silva axis would have really freshened up Manuel Pelligrini\xe2\x80\x99s champions). But Mangala looks like a high-class defensive athlete who will be utterly unfazed by the Premier league\xe2\x80\x99s very specific physical demands. This could be the start of a beautiful Belgo-flavoured friendship.

In weekend Premier League matches after Thursday night Europa League ties last season, Tottenham Hotspur lost six of 12. This time out, it became two of three after the 1-0 home defeat to West Bromwich Albion on Sunday. \xe2\x80\x9cHistory here says Tottenham have a problem after the Europa League,\xe2\x80\x9d Mauricio Pochettino, the manager, said after the game. \xe2\x80\x9cToday, we repeat the same.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Tottenham had travelled to Partizan Belgrade in the Europa League last Thursday, where they drew 0-0, and yet Pochettino made 10 changes to his starting line-up for the visit of West Brom. The goalkeeper, Hugo Lloris, was the only constant. Erik Lamela and \xc3\x89tienne Capoue came off the bench in Serbia before starting against West Brom; Roberto Soldado appeared as a substitute in both games while Aaron Lennon and Paulinho, starters against Partizan, were substitutes on Sunday. It might also be noted that Eric Dier, Vlad Chiriches and Christian Eriksen travelled to Serbia only to be unused substitutes. Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s problems against West Brom were less about European exertions and more about familiar failings at White Hart Lane, namely the struggle to create chances against well-drilled opponents that look to punch on the counter-attack.

Of course, as Ronald Koeman said after they beat Swansea 1-0 to continue their implausibly good start to the season, this is not a time to celebrate for the Saints, but it does at least mean that the worst predictions of calamity won\xe2\x80\x99t come to pass this season. Not that those predicting calamity have any need to feel too silly, because after their squad was gutted by Liverpool and Manchester United, it was a perfectly logical stance to take. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just that Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren and Rickie Lambert have been sold, but that their replacements were all gambles to various degrees. Ryan Bertrand has been solid at best for the assorted clubs he has represented, Shane Long\xe2\x80\x99s goals record isn\xe2\x80\x99t especially inspiring, a quick word with Celtic fans will tell you Fraser Forster\xe2\x80\x99s reputation north of the border isn\xe2\x80\x99t as good as it is in the south, while Graziano Pelle and Dusan Tadic came from the Eredivisie, a source from which the quality returns have been ... variable, at best. Add to that Ronald Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s peripatetic managerial career so far, which has seen him coach eight clubs in 14 years and not all of them particularly well, last winning anything of note in 2008. But it\xe2\x80\x99s going rather well so far, giving delightful confirmation, if confirmation was needed, that as much as we talk and write about and try to make sense of this game, logic doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really play a part in any of it.

As in April, Palace recorded a 3-2 win at Everton to leave Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez at a loss to explain his team\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful defending. As in April, Yannick Bolasie was inspired at Goodison as his pace, strength and awareness gave the England international John Stones a trying afternoon at right-back. The Lyon-born Congo international helped turn Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s contest with a hopeful header that resulted in a penalty gift from Tim Howard, scored the decisive third and was a constant problem for a creaking Everton defence. His performance invited the question of why we don\xe2\x80\x99t see them more often? \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s good having Wilfried Zaha there to make sure Yannick tries hard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neil Warnock as he toasted his first win back at Palace. \xe2\x80\x9cI had him at QPR and wanted to sign him but Flavio [Briatore] didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to spend the money and he ended up at Bristol City. He is a threat. The problem with him is he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what he is going to do but that means defenders don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to do either. But he was tireless today. He is going to be really important for us.\xe2\x80\x9d Andy Hunter</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Everton 2-3 Crystal Palace: read the match report</p>  7) Robertson is flying at Hull <p>Andrew Robertson cost Hull under \xc2\xa33m when he swapped Dundee United for Steve Bruce\xe2\x80\x99s side during the summer. Since then the 20-year-old Glaswegian has been consistently impressive and was excellent at left back during the 2-2 draw at Newcastle, displaying fabulous acceleration on the overlap. True, Robertson\xe2\x80\x99s failure to deal with Moussa Sissoko\xe2\x80\x99s cross permitted Yoan Gouffran to head on, thereby enabling Papiss Ciss\xc3\xa9 to score his second goal but otherwise Robertson shone. Steve Bruce has made some good buys down the years but Robertson \xe2\x80\x93 who is also well suited to deployment at left wing back in a 3-5-2 system \xe2\x80\x93 looks potentially one of his very best signings.

The corner from which Ciaran Clark almost scored, midway through the first half when the game was still in the balance, was exquisitely curled in, evocative of David Beckham. Villa fans can start dreaming of what Christian Benteke might make of such service when he returns next month.</p> <p>The midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s neat first-time passing game is also of the highest order, notwithstanding all the Twitter abuse he received in his latter days at Manchester United. What does cost him is the ease with which opponents can brush past him, as Arsenal did at will on Saturday. It will be asking a lot of Fabian Delph and Ashley Westwood to cover; Carlos S\xc3\xa1nchez looks some way off being ready for the Premier League.</p>           Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger and Paul Lambert reflect on Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s 3-0 win    <p>Villa will do well to make Cleverley\xe2\x80\x99s move from United permanent in January although the lightness of his play does prompt the notion of how well he might fare in a more technical league elsewhere in Europe. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be fascinating to see how Cleverley could prosper in La Liga, should Valencia remain interested, the Eredivisie or Ligue 1? And would he become a better player if his confidence grew proportionately? Perhaps Cleverley would be more likely to boost his chances of an international recall if he made the unusual step of becoming a successful Englishman abroad.

It would be interesting to know how many people wrote \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t bother \xe2\x80\x93 or at least wait until we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a team likely to spend a while in the Premier League\xe2\x80\x9d. Just over 16,000 watched Rangers plod to a draw with Stoke on Saturday and the ground was almost never full during last season\xe2\x80\x99s run to promotion from the Championship. So even though hidden masses of fans turned up for the play-off final at Wembley, it is hard to envisage Rangers filling a new 40,000-seater stadium by 2018 (current owners of the proposed site permitting). Especially if they are not in the Premier League, which is a strong possibility.

They have kept three consecutive clean sheets, something the Clarets last managed in the top flight in 1968, to provide a contrast with their most recent experience of the Premier League. Five years ago, Burnley outscored sides who stayed up but conceded 82 times. Now they have gone 337 minutes of league football without conceding, and they have done it with a defence constructed from limited raw materials. The 36-year-old centre-back Michael Duff cost \xc2\xa330,000 from Cheltenham Town a decade ago. Full-backs Kieran Trippier and Ben Mee started at Manchester City and goalkeeper Tom Heaton at Manchester United, but none made a Premier League appearance. Captain Jason Shackell had not played in the top flight for nine years. Their success together is testament to their organisation and unity.
