b'Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink relishes being tested as novice Burton manager'


b'<p>Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink puffs out his cheeks as he reflects on his first couple of weeks in charge of Burton Albion and a chain of events that would test the most experienced managers in the business, let alone someone who describes himself as a novice.</p> <p>The story starts on 13 November, the day the former Chelsea striker was unveiled as the League Two club\xe2\x80\x99s manager and when Dean Lyness, the Burton goalkeeper, broke his leg in Hasselbaink\xe2\x80\x99s first training session. \xe2\x80\x9cCrazy. A collision,\xe2\x80\x9d Hasselbaink says. \xe2\x80\x9cMy centre-half with my goalkeeper, the ball 50-50, they give 100%, and they both think they could get it. We knew [it was broken] straight away.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Four days later, at Wycombe Wanderers, in Hasselbaink\xe2\x80\x99s first match since taking over from Gary Rowett, the team coach was stuck in traffic, arrived at the ground late and, after another mix-up, Burton ended up borrowing some playing kit from their opponents. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything was going wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d Hasselbaink says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe stayed in Marlow [for pre-match food] at the Crowne Plaza. We came to the roundabout, chock-a-block. And I know that area really well because my wife was born in High Wycombe. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking: \xe2\x80\x98This is not good.\xe2\x80\x99</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe arrived at 10 to seven. Normally, you have at least 30-40 minutes to get undressed, get massages, speak, put the music on, relax. There was none of that. I was late getting the team sheet in, so we called it through from the coach. Then, coming to the stadium, my kitman says to me: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a problem. We can\xe2\x80\x99t wear our socks because the colours clash.\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking: \xe2\x80\x98Welcome.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Burton, playing in yellow shirts, black shorts and sky-blue Wycombe socks, won 3-1 and Hasselbaink\xe2\x80\x99s managerial career in England was up and running on the back of the worst preparation possible. Those early trials and tribulations, however, were soon to be put into perspective.</p> <p>Lydia Bennett, a 17-year-old who played for Burton Albion women\xe2\x80\x99s team, collapsed and died at home on 4 November. Five days after the victory over Wycombe, Burton paid tribute to the teenager in Hasselbaink\xe2\x80\x99s first home match, a 1-0 win over Luton Town. The funeral took place last Thursday.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cVery, very, very sad. I\xe2\x80\x99m a father of an 18-year-old so \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Hasselbaink says, his voice trailing off as he shakes his head. \xe2\x80\x9cWe went to the funeral, me and my assistant [David Oldfield] and the chairman [Ben Robinson] and a few players. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to go but it was right somebody represented the club in the right way. I\xe2\x80\x99m the manager of the club, I should be there. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know Lydia but as a club you need to show your condolences. It was really hard. The church was full, with a lot of young people \xe2\x80\x93 it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look right.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The emotional scenes before the Luton game, when Lydia\xe2\x80\x99s parents were on the pitch, touched Hasselbaink deeply. \xe2\x80\x9cIt told me a lot about the club but it also told me a lot about Luton. They were magnificent. Their supporters, the silence, the respect they showed. And also our fans \xe2\x80\x93 it felt like we were like one. The community is very important for this club. We need to show we appreciate that and that we mourn with the family and her sisters, and she\xe2\x80\x99s not forgotten, that they are still part of us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Listening to Hasselbaink talk sensitively at times, extremely passionately on another occasions, and with humility and honesty throughout, it is easy to see why Robinson \xe2\x80\x93 a man who gave Neil Warnock and Nigel Clough their break in management \xe2\x80\x93 was so impressed when he interviewed the Dutchman for a vacancy that attracted 60 applications.</p> <p>Less obvious, at first glance, is why Hasselbaink, who was in charge of Royal Antwerp in the Belgian second division last season, was so interested in managing Burton. This, after all, is a man who played 23 times for Holland, appeared at a World Cup finals, sits 11th on the all-time Premier League goalscorers\xe2\x80\x99 list, after scoring 127 times for Leeds United, Chelsea, Middlesbrough and Charlton, and cannot be short of a bob or two. Not that long ago he was driving a Bentley down the King\xe2\x80\x99s Road.</p> <p>Does he really have to do this job? \xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, because I want to, that\xe2\x80\x99s why I have to,\xe2\x80\x9d Hasselbaink says, raising his voice a little and sounding almost affronted. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a player, I had to come from far. I had to graft. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind grafting but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see this as grafting, I see this as a good opportunity. You can go to League One or the Championship and they don\xe2\x80\x99t have as good a job as I have. The training facilities [at St George\xe2\x80\x99s Park] are not going to be better. They might have more money to spend on players. They might be working with technically better players but that\xe2\x80\x99s it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>While some managers like to bang on about a distinguished playing career, Hasselbaink, whose family home is in Surrey, views what happened in the past as irrelevant. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it. Never. The other day we were driving to the game at Wycombe and there were goals of mine on Sky on the team coach. I was embarrassed. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s me, but \xc2\xa0... it\xe2\x80\x99s gone. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have to talk about when I was a player. I have to earn my right as a manager, as a coach.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>For Hasselbaink, whose fourth-placed Burton travel to Exeter on Saturday, earning his right has nothing to do with the colour of his skin. The 42-year-old is one of three black managers across the 92 League clubs but it is not a statistic or subject he dwells on. \xe2\x80\x9cI applied for this job because I am the right person. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t apply because I\xe2\x80\x99m black. I know the chairman has given me the job because he thinks I\xe2\x80\x99m the best man for it. That\xe2\x80\x99s it.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe can talk about me being black \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m proud to be black. My kids are going to have my black culture in a way and I want that because we\xe2\x80\x99re black. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to hide that and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hide that. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think when I get out of my bed: \xe2\x80\x98Oh, I\xe2\x80\x99m black, I need to do this, I need to do that.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Straight-talking, no nonsense, Hasselbaink tells it how it is and he had no qualms with the managers who took that approach with him. He speaks with great fondness about George Graham, who signed him for Leeds in 1997 \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cI really love that man. He was the biggest personality in that team, he was the boss\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 and is hugely respectful of Louis van Gaal, his former Holland coach. \xe2\x80\x9cVery intimidating but very fair and very loving. And that all goes in one. If you keep on doing things wrong, he will pinpoint you. If you do it good, he will also tell you that you did it good. He\xe2\x80\x99s also got a soft side to him that you don\xe2\x80\x99t see. If you go and speak to him, he\xe2\x80\x99s very open. He\xe2\x80\x99s a good man.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Then there is Steve McClaren, whom Hasselbaink played for at Middlesbrough, coached under at Nottingham Forest and sought advice from before taking over at Burton. \xe2\x80\x9cBest English coach there is. Fact. Because he can coach. He can make players better. He went with the modern game. He\xe2\x80\x99s not still there, where he was 10 years ago when he was at Middlesbrough, where he was also successful. He has evolved.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Hasselbaink is also a different man. The swashbuckling striker who mastered the art of scoring recognises he has everything to prove as a manager, which is why he has no time for the idea that working at League Two level is beneath him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that mean: \xe2\x80\x98Too big for that\xe2\x80\x99? If I was Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho and I would come to Burton, then you can say something. I know my role. I know who I am, I know what I have done but as a manager, I consider myself a novice.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
