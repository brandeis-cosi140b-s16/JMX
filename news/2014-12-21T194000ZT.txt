b'The price of football at Christmas 1982: \xc2\xa32.55 a ticket - but kits cost a bomb'


b'<p>Christmas 1982. Liverpool lead the First Division by five points from Manchester United. Ren\xc3\xa9e &amp; Renato\xe2\x80\x99s Save Your Love, a 3min 6sec-sized cruise missile of an earworm \xe2\x80\x93 which still burrows into many worst-song-of-all-time lists \xe2\x80\x93 tops the charts. And, like many seven-year-old boys, almost everything I covet is in Shoot! magazine.</p> <p>The Subbuteo Fifa World Cup Edition. A replica kit. Even, in weaker moments, the 100% cotton towelling robes in team colours \xe2\x80\x93 which, the advert promised, \xe2\x80\x9cmakes a superb gift for all the family\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s Guardian, in which my colleague Hilary Osborne unearthed a Boots catalogue from 1982 showing that a Ferguson video recorder cost \xc2\xa3599 \xe2\x80\x93 or \xc2\xa31,863 at 2014 prices \xe2\x80\x93 brought memories scampering back. It also provided an excuse to crawl into the mustiest corners of my attic and dig through yellowing magazines to see how the price of football, from ticket prices to tat, has changed.</p> <p>That Subbuteo edition, with Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s brooding Nelinho on the box lid, \xc2\xa328.95. Which, given the Office for National Statistics confirms that prices are 3.11 times higher now than in Christmas 1982 (when adjusted for inflation as measured by the retail prices index) equates to \xc2\xa390 today.</p>     Shoot! 1982. Photograph: Sean Ingle    <p>Those 100% cotton towelling robes? \xc2\xa320 after postage \xe2\x80\x93 or \xc2\xa362 in 2014 prices. Meanwhile, team quilt covers and pillowcases, beloved of many an 80s\xe2\x80\x99 pre-teen, were the equivalent of \xc2\xa367 today.</p> <p>Football books were far from cheap, too. The Hamlyn Book of Football Techniques and Tactics by Richard Widdows \xe2\x80\x9cwith 192 fully illustrated pages with approximately 200 colour illustrations\xe2\x80\x9d was \xc2\xa36.95 (\xc2\xa322). Yet videos were even pricier. A 60-minute film of Espa\xc3\xb1a 82 cost \xc2\xa333.60 (\xc2\xa3104) \xe2\x80\x93 extortionate given the average weekly wage in 1982 was \xc2\xa3136.50 before tax.</p> <p>But the biggest surprise was the cost of a football kit. I had assumed that prices went into overdrive during English football\xe2\x80\x99s post-Euro 96 gentrification period. Not so. One advert in Shoot! promising \xe2\x80\x9ctop team replica strips\xe2\x80\x9d offered adult Manchester United home and away Adidas kits for \xc2\xa317.80 (\xc2\xa355), while Umbro\xe2\x80\x99s Arsenal, Liverpool and Brazil kits cost \xc2\xa318.95 (\xc2\xa359).</p> <p>And Spurs\xe2\x80\x99 Le Coq Sportif kit, which Glenn Hoddle insisted was \xe2\x80\x9cjust the thing to get me through a tough season \xe2\x80\x93 with all the style and staying power you\xe2\x80\x99d expect from the foremost fashion sports company in the world\xe2\x80\x9d, cost a staggering \xc2\xa320.75, equivalent to \xc2\xa364 today.</p> <p>True, in 1982 that bought shorts, socks and an official jersey. But the prices have not risen as much as I expected. A full Spurs kit in 2014, for instance, costs \xc2\xa378 - although Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s is more at \xc2\xa382. An aside: in 1982 the biggest size was XL. Nowadays clubs offer 2XL and 3XL as standard.</p> <p>I had also expected children\xe2\x80\x99s kits in 2014 to be comparatively more expensive than in 1982. In fact in some cases they are less. A Manchester United boys\xe2\x80\x99 kit in 1982 cost \xc2\xa313.50 (\xc2\xa342). In 2014 it is \xc2\xa338. Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s strip, meanwhile, was \xc2\xa314.50 (\xc2\xa345) in 1982, while a mini-kit in 2014 will set parents back \xc2\xa340.</p> <p>Yet when it came to ticket prices every hardened prejudice was confirmed. In The Economics of Football, the academics Stephen Dobson and John Goddard record the average cost to watch First Division football (the equivalent of today\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League) in 1982-83 as \xc2\xa32.55 \xe2\x80\x93 the equivalent of \xc2\xa37 in 2014 prices. No wonder, then, that there was outrage in December 1982 when the top-priced seat for England\xe2\x80\x99s match against Luxembourg was \xc2\xa313 (\xc2\xa340), with the cheapest at \xc2\xa37 (\xc2\xa322).</p> <p>As a Shoot! editorial put it: \xe2\x80\x9cFor the same price you could catch a return ferry from Folkestone to Boulogne, twice in a day. Or, if you\xe2\x80\x99re on a health kick, you could stock up the fridge with 65 pints of milk. The \xc2\xa313 would also buy two LPs with plenty of change, 81 Mars bars \xe2\x80\x93 or 18 pints of bitter.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Shoot! 1982. Photograph: Sean Ingle    <p>Still, tickets were still comparatively cheaper than the \xc2\xa325-\xc2\xa355 they were for adults at England\xe2\x80\x99s game against San Marino in October. Meanwhile in the Premier League, the cheapest Chelsea ticket is now \xc2\xa350. And while Hull, Leicester and West Ham do charge under \xc2\xa320 for some fixtures, simple supply and demand dictates that prices are likely to keep rising.</p> <p>In the early 80s, the economics worked very differently. Football was broke. And with unemployment figures well above three million, many fans were too. A festering miasma of decrepit grounds and hooliganism hardly helped. Too often fans were treated like animals. Too often they behaved like them.</p> <p>To raise money, some clubs delved outside the penalty box. Watford offered a special deal for overseas tourists \xe2\x80\x93 bed and breakfast and a ticket at \xc2\xa317 all-in. Torquay United made \xc2\xa31,000 from a target golf competition on their Plainmoor pitch and, as the Guardian reported, further boosted their bank balance by organising wrestling bouts and an antique fair.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on Christmas Day 1982 I became one of football\xe2\x80\x99s new romantics when I was given my own kit. It was far from official: my parents bought a generic strip and stuck a badge on it. It was all they could afford, but I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have cared less. There is a still a latent pride when I look at photos of me wearing it. Pride I doubt I\xe2\x80\x99d feel if I had been given a cotton-towelling robe instead.</p>     Shoot! 1982.
