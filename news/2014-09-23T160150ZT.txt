b'The Fiver | A rather large oversight'


b'WEIGHED DOWN <p>In the absence of Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s hilarious travelling troupe, tonight\xe2\x80\x99s third-round Rumbelows Cup action will have to make do with Middlesbrough travelling to Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99s ailing Liverpool side, who are finding this campaign a tad more challenging than last season\xe2\x80\x99s glorious stumble to second place. Some might suggest this is caused by the increased burden placed on the squad by Big Cup participation \xe2\x80\x93 although it should be said midweek breaks have done their rival Reds no favours \xe2\x80\x93 but Anfield\xe2\x80\x99s very own motivational maestro has another explanation.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe weight of the jersey here is heavy for most [new] players,\xe2\x80\x9d offered up Rodgers. Far be it from the Fiver to judge, but this seems like a rather large oversight on behalf of kit manufacturers Warrior. These super-heavy designs may be fine for the colossal beasts of American football and the one where you batter each other with sticks, but the US company might want to consider something more dainty for delicate waifs like Rickie Lambert and Mario Balotelli. Ah, it seems Rodgers was talking metaphorically. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat people probably don\xe2\x80\x99t get is the pressure of playing for such a big club,\xe2\x80\x9d he declared. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce you adapt to playing for Liverpool you become clearer in your thinking.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Before anyone could ask Rodgers if he perhaps should have considered the mental hardship of playing for such a Big Club in Big Cup before signing eight new players and Dejan Lovren, he tore into a typically complex analysis of Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s travails. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to get back to doing what we do best,\xe2\x80\x9d he roared, corralling the squad into a tight circle. \xe2\x80\x9cI look at the movement patterns in our team, our pressing in those patterns of pressure and, given the injuries, I need to retain a system for a longer period. The 4-4-2 diamond worked really well but it worked well with certain players and not at the weekend \xe2\x80\xa6 Confidence has not been affected so far but if you don\xe2\x80\x99t win games for too long it can be.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>What Rodgers wants you to take away from his utterings is that any suggestion that Big Cup duty is affecting the players physically is stuff and nonsense to be brushed aside in favour of an explanation that will have Steve Peters rubbing his hands with glee as he seeks to connect the squad with their inner chimp. So the person that said this about the subject on Saturday is presumably best ignored: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you play on the Saturday, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got Sunday/Monday for recovery. You\xe2\x80\x99ve then got the Tuesday game and then the players who play are recovering Wednesday/Thursday. So you\xe2\x80\x99re doing your first tactical preparation on the Friday and then you\xe2\x80\x99re travelling straight down to the [next] game. [Big Cup] is a tiring competition.\xe2\x80\x9d That person? You\xe2\x80\x99re already ahead of us, reader.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Toby Moses for MBM coverage of Liverpool 2-1 Middlesbrough in the Milk Cup from 7.45pm BST.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFurthermore, there is little doubt that third-party investors do influence the transfer policies of clubs even though Fifa rules expressly forbid this. These are actually the findings of Fifa\xe2\x80\x99s own \xe2\x80\x93 detailed \xe2\x80\x93 research into this subject. So, it\xe2\x80\x99s now time to act, and if Fifa does not address the problem, then Uefa will\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 to be honest, the work of Proper Journalism\xe2\x80\x99s David Conn and Owen Gibson flies right over our heads [just the work of Proper Journalism\xe2\x80\x99s David Conn and Owen Gibson? \xe2\x80\x93 Fiver Ed], but we\xe2\x80\x99re told this is pretty strong stuff; Uefa suit Gianni Infantino reveals plans to act against the third-party ownership of players.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel.

A story so uneventful and uninspiring that I have kept it hidden for years. Only because the Fiver is so desperate for letters does it stand any chance of publication. I did my motorcycle licence training with James Dean Bradfield in 1995, in Old Wembley Car Park, beneath the fabled Twin Towers. At that point, they had already written Motown Junk, and, crucially, Motorcycle Emptiness. So JDB wrote that song before he could even wobble around some cones on a DT125. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. Erm. Chelsea look a bit good at the moment, don\xe2\x80\x99t they?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Steve Hibbert.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters. If Simon Lea had been paying attention whilst enjoying Channel 4\xe2\x80\x99s excellent Undercover Boss, he would have realised the programme places a chief executive in a junior position in his or her own company, rather than the role of a customer. As such, for Mike Ashley to be part of the programme, it is more likely he would take the lowliest role at the club, most likely that of a Newcastle player. Having admired both Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s frame in a replica shirt and also his club\xe2\x80\x99s league position, I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine he would be any better than the current \xe2\x80\x98big guy up front\xe2\x80\x99, but also, probably not much worse\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Anthony Probert.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI do commend Philip Smith for his mostly excellent memory (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters). I was indeed touting for work back in January 2005. It was part of that day\xe2\x80\x99s edition of \xe2\x80\x98Tonight\xe2\x80\x99s TV &amp; Radio\xe2\x80\x99 (rather than Fiver Letters, which it appears was an extended Christmas leave of absence) along with various letters attempting to flirt with a Ms Helen Tomkins (who may by now be Mrs Helen Something-Else-Entirely). I did have a letter published later that year, a missive about Ashley Cole\xe2\x80\x99s asset value to Arsenal. It being fact-based and non-humorous, it fulfilled 50% of the criteria for being published in the Fiver. I know not what Philip\xe2\x80\x99s witty response was at the time, but in response to today\xe2\x80\x99s kind query I can confirm I found a job the very next day \xe2\x80\x93 working for Manchester City FC, a job that lasted for over seven years \xe2\x80\x93 but not in any way related to the Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s assistance\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Kevin Carter.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLast April, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t open an issue of the Fiver without reading about Manchester United and their bunch of under-achievers: even to the extent that you ignored Leicester City\xe2\x80\x99s winning of the Championship title (you will recall I mentioned it in passing). Now you are alone among football-reporting media (worldwide) in not even mentioning Leicester Who? 5-3 Star-studded Manchester United \xe2\x80\x93 let alone West Brom winning at Spurs for the first time in 40 years and Crystal Palace slapping Everton at home. Instead, you write almost 500 words of drivel about a 1-1 draw between two oligarch-owned teams managed by the least interesting managers ever to (dis)grace a football pitch. What\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with you?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Martyn Wilson.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSpeaking as someone who has twice won prizes from the Fiver, I can vouch for the fact that they are overrated. But it does seem a bit rubbish that an email newsletter connected with Big Paper can\xe2\x80\x99t afford the odd trinket or token to chuck at its most entertaining letter-writers. Should some of the readership bung in some prizes, to help you out? I\xe2\x80\x99ll happily start the ball rolling with a copy of my latest book. I do realise that feminist poetry may not be everyone\xe2\x80\x99s cup of tea, but with titles like \xe2\x80\x98The Biggest Problem\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98Still Life\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98$exual Positions for Those No Longer Young\xe2\x80\x99, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you can see the relevance to both league football and the lives of your readers. Anyway, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to offer a whole one copy to a (lucky?) reader\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Cathy Bryant.</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And if you\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing better to do you can also tweet the Fiver. Today\xe2\x80\x99s winner of our letter o\xe2\x80\x99the day is: Martyn Wilson, who wins a copy of Cathy Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s latest book, Look at All the Women.</p> JOIN GUARDIAN SOULMATES <p>Chances are that if you\xe2\x80\x99re reading this tea-timely football email, you\xe2\x80\x99re almost certainly single.

Class speaks for itself,\xe2\x80\x9d typed Magath on his Facebook page, presumably before sharing some pictures of babies, writing \xe2\x80\x98LOL\xe2\x80\x99 a lot and pasting in loads of that winking emoji.</p> <p>Portugal have appointed Fernando Santos as their new coach.</p> <p>Manchester City are likely to extend Frank Lampard\xe2\x80\x99s loan from New York City just long enough for him to perform an orchestrated celebration by \xe2\x80\x98not celebrating\xe2\x80\x99 against Chelsea again at the end of January.</p> <p>Ravel Morrison has wound up on loan at Cardiff City. In a tweet he subsequently deleted and which the Fiver thinks is about West Ham, he parped: \xe2\x80\x9cI got no ratings off people in the club not the club it\xe2\x80\x99s self just people in it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Around 1,000 Nottingham Forest fans will pay tribute to the late Brian Clough by wearing green round-necked jumpers at Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s Coca-Cola Cup game with Tottenham.</p> <p>And Lord Ferg will take time out from watching the fruits of his legacy-shredding labours at Old Trafford to address Europe\xe2\x80\x99s players at the Ryder Cup tonight. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a West Ham fan, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve always loved the way his teams played,\xe2\x80\x9d cheered the hosts\xe2\x80\x99 captain Paul McGinley.</p> RECOMMENDED VIEWING <p>What is third-party ownership.
