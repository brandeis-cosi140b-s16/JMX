b'<p>Ray Wilkins will move to Jordan next week to begin a five-month spell in charge of the country\xe2\x80\x99s national team.</p> <p>The 57-year-old, who most recently worked as assistant head coach at Fulham last season under Rene Meulensteen, will be assisted by the former Arsenal and Republic of Ireland forward Frank Stapleton.</p> <p>The former England international will lead the team at the AFC Asian Cup in Australia in January.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI am relocating, Frank and I will be moving out in the middle of next week, so we will be putting a lot of time and effort into the job,\xe2\x80\x9d Wilkins told Sky Sports News.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only for five months, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a long-term thing, it\xe2\x80\x99s just until we get the Asian Cup over with. They\xe2\x80\x99ve reached the quarter-finals on the last two occasions, so let\xe2\x80\x99s hope we can go a couple better.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to go down there [to Australia] in January and attempt to achieve something with them. I saw the guys train, they look a very lively bunch, so we\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward to getting stuck in.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t be seeking any advice, we\xe2\x80\x99ll just get out there and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to crack on. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to train the guys to try and get to a little bit of a better fitness level.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Jordan Football Association, which announced the appointment on its official website, said Wilkins would take charge of the team after their friendlies against Uzbekistan on Thursday and China five days later. His first match in charge will be against Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur on 11 October.</p> <p>At the 2015 AFC Asian Cup Jordan are in the same group as Japan, Iraq and Palestine. Jordan are ranked 56th in the world by Fifa, sandwiched between Finland and South Korea and 10 places above the Republic of Ireland.</p> <p>The JFA said its president Prince Ali Bin al-Hussein had chosen Wilkins. It said Wilkins had accompanied Prince Ali to the team\xe2\x80\x99s training session on 28 August to \xe2\x80\x9ctake a closer look at the team and observe the technical and fitness side of al-Nashama [the team\xe2\x80\x99s nickname]\xe2\x80\x9d. The JFA said he had then studied videos of the team\xe2\x80\x99s matches.</p> <p>Jordan have never qualified for the World Cup, but only missed out on a place in Brazil this summer by losing a play-off to Uruguay, 5-0 on aggregate.</p> <p>Wilkins admitted a successful Asian Cup campaign could persuade him to continue in the role and lead the team into the 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf we were to be successful \xe2\x80\x93 and please God we are \xe2\x80\x93 then I would certainly have to look at it, but I would have to look at my family situation as well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>Wilkins, who won 84 caps for England and has also coached at Chelsea, joined the Fulham staff last December, but lasted less than two months before leaving when Felix Magath came in as manager in February.</p>'
