b'Manchester City target Everton\xe2\x80\x99s Ross Barkley to fill homegrown gap'


b'<p>Ross Barkley is a target for Manchester City next summer with the champions valuing the midfielder at around \xc2\xa330m and viewing him as among a select few English homegrown players who could slot instantly into their team. City also hope Joe Hart and James Milner will sign the new deals they have been offered.</p> <p>City were interested in buying Barkley in the close season but would not countenance paying Everton\xe2\x80\x99s asking price of \xc2\xa350m. There is a recognition many of Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s squad are at their peak so the need to start building for the future is pressing.</p> <p>To do so, City require players who are either already established players of the quality of Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9, David Silva, Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero, Vincent Kompany, Hart, Samir Nasri and Edin Dzeko, or have the potential to be so, as with Eliaquim Mangala, who is 23 and cost \xc2\xa332m during the summer.</p> <p>With the Premier League and Uefa demanding clubs should have eight homegrown footballers in their squads for their respective competitions, City have found it a challenge to find English players of the requisite quality. In recent seasons Adam Johnson, Jack Rodwell and Scott Sinclair were all bought to fill the berths, while Micah Richards was at the club from a young age. All have left City apart from Sinclair who remains on the fringes of the first team.</p> <p>Although the signings of Johnson, Rodwell and Sinclair are viewed as errors of judgment \xe2\x80\x93 Richards has also disappointed and is on loan at Fiorentina \xe2\x80\x93 there is a belief that Barkley is a far better player who can one day replace the 31-year-old Tour\xc3\xa9, 11 years Barkley\xe2\x80\x99s senior.</p> <p>Before firming up their interest in Barkley during the summer, City did detailed background checks on the England international and were encouraged by the results. The club\xe2\x80\x99s information showed Barkley is intent on a successful career and has a winning mentality.</p>           Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho and Manuel Pellegrini happy with 1-1 draw    <p>When Pellegrini informed the City hierarchy Barkley was good enough to help the club to win more Premier League titles and to claim a first European Cup, inquiries were made at Everton. Though City valued Barkley at \xc2\xa320m, they were prepared to pay a premium of over \xc2\xa330m to secure his signing but Bill Kenwright, the Everton chairman, quoted a price of \xc2\xa350m for the midfielder, and City decided to put their interest on hold.</p> <p>However, despite Everton\xe2\x80\x99s valuation it is believed they will sell next summer with the price thought to be negotiable. Barkley, who is sidelined because of a knee injury, signed a four-year contract worth around \xc2\xa360,000 a-week in July, a deal he was offered by the club as they sought to strengthen their bargaining position.</p> <p>While City believe that there is a paucity of English talent, they believe within three years \xe2\x80\x93 and possibly even two \xe2\x80\x93 their academy will yield such players. There is even confidence at the club they have an 11-year-old on the books who can be better than Lionel Messi.</p> <p>The development of their own players is viewed as a long-term plan that should offer a continual supply to the first team. The club\xe2\x80\x99s Etihad Campus training complex, which is situated across the road from the stadium, is due to be opened next month.</p> <p>After a number of Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s players signed fresh deals, the club have started discussions with Hart and Milner over contracts. Hart, 27, is in the final two years of his deal. Milner, who was among City\xe2\x80\x99s standout performers in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 1-1 draw with Chelsea at the Etihad Stadium, has less than 12 months remaining.</p>'
