b'Football: 10 things to look out for this weekend'


b'1) Spurs have everything not to play for <p>With matches against Stoke, Hull and Everton remaining this season, Tottenham Hotspur are up against it in the race to avoid qualifying for next season\xe2\x80\x99s Europa League. As if the prospect of facing two teams with nothing to play for isn\xe2\x80\x99t bad enough, their fate is no longer in their own hands: even three consecutive defeats will not be enough to save them and they will still be relying on favours from the teams beneath them to extricate themselves from their current pickle.</p> <p>Southampton (Leicester away, Aston Villa at home, Man City away) and Swansea (Arsenal away, Man City away and Crystal Palace at home) have tougher run-ins and it seems unlikely both will win enough points to save Spurs, who could end up counting on an Aston Villa FA Cup final win to keep them out of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s second tier competition and improve their chances of breaking into the top four next season. Never mind the relegation battle, these are stressful times at White Hart Lane, where with three games of the season remaining there is everything to not play for.

Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe [Gerrard] is a historical player for Liverpool, a historical player for the Premier League and an opponent I have always admired and respected. We did everything to try [to sign him] and it was almost there. I was dreaming of [Claude] Mak\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9, Gerrard and [Frank] Lampard in midfield. We were playing in a proper triangle without a No10 and playing Maka in front of the defenders. Me, Mr Abramovich and [the former Chelsea chief executive] Peter Kenyon at that time, we dreamed of that. His people were open to him joining a top side like Chelsea. But to me personally he never said he would come. Never. He [Gerrard] was always a red and I think the decision was right\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho, January 2015</p> <p>You wonder if Steven Gerrard himself will still think the decision was right when he lines up in the guard of honour to welcome the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s new champions on to the pitch on Sunday. In all likelihood, yes. It might be a slightly bittersweet occasion for the Liverpool midfielder but he has always insisted he never really wanted to leave the club in the summer of 2005, when the Reds\xe2\x80\x99 rejection of a \xc2\xa332m bid from Chelsea led to a transfer request and all manner of brouhaha. But few would blame him if, even if just for a moment, his thoughts stray to what might have been.

Since then their record away from home reads: DLDLDDLLLD, a 10-match sequence Tim Sherwood will be hoping to embellish with another \xe2\x80\x98L\xe2\x80\x99 in his bid to secure Villa\xe2\x80\x99s survival as quickly as possible and focus his energies on the FA Cup final against Arsenal. Things to look out for? The novice West Ham central defender Reece Burke testing his teenage mettle against the currently unstoppable force that is Christian Benteke, the resurgent Tom Cleverley continuing to answer his many critics and a raft of monotonously predictable but highly amusing barbs about Tory spoofer David Cameron being pleased whatever the outcome.

Jermaine Defoe and Sunderland go in search of a vital victory against Everton. Photograph: Ian Horrocks/Sunderland AFC via Getty Images    <p>With Newcastle in a tailspin and apparently relying on the charity and ineptitude of others to keep them in the Premier League, there is a delicious irony in the fact that their north-east rivals Sunderland may very well be the club that comes up short and pulls through for them. Sunderland will next be pitted against their fellow relegation battlers Leicester (h), Arsenal (a) and Chelsea (a), so a win in the early Saturday afternoon fixture against Everton would catapult Dick Advocaat\xe2\x80\x99s side four places up the table, leaving them above Newcastle for at least a couple of hours, if not several generations. While the six points a season guaranteed from matches against the Magpies would certainly be missed, it\xe2\x80\x99s still an excellent incentive for them to triumph at Goodison Park.</p> <p>Under Gus Poyet, Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s approach couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been more conservative if it was wearing full Bullingdon boy regalia and braying about the peasantry at a club social in a posh restaurant. By stark contrast, Advocaat has ordered full-backs Patrick van Aanholt and Billy Jones to get forward and provide width, while Jermain Defoe and Connor Wickham tuck in to support the lone centre-forward Steven Fletcher. It is an attacking collective that is unlikely to strike terror into the hearts of defenders who have kept clean sheets in their last four matches at home but might be potent enough to get a goal or two against a back four that shipped three against Aston Villa last week. A tough one to call this, unless you\xe2\x80\x99re something other than a delusional Sunderland fan, in which case the obvious call is: Everton.

Saturday victories for the other relegation candidates meant they went into their Monday game against Arsenal with the gap closing and they produced a timid display. They will have to cope rather better with the nerves against a Burnley side who are in the last chance saloon. Anything other than a win relegates the Clarets.</p> <p>There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt as to what has put them in this predicament. Only one team in the past five seasons \xe2\x80\x93 Norwich in 2013-14 \xe2\x80\x93 have scored fewer than 30 goals in a Premier League campaign. Burnley have thus far scored just 26. Dyche this week insisted that there has been nothing wrong with his side tactically, and that the problem has been a failure to take chances rather than create them. In their last nine games, they have scored just once \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0the only goal of the game against Manchester City at Turf Moor. If they do not break that run, it\xe2\x80\x99s over. JA</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Duff free to play in relegation battle at Hull  6) Can Leicester cope with a different kind of pressure?     Leonardo Ulloa celebrates scoring against Newcastle last week. Photograph: Alan Walter/Action Images via Reuters    <p>Five wins in six have given Leicester a great chance to stay up but their work is far from done. They were in such dire straits before this recent surge that they are clear of the relegation zone by a solitary point. Southampton were obliging visitors to Sunderland last weekend and with the Foxes making their own trip to the Stadium of Light next week, Nigel Pearson will be keen to seize the opportunity for a bit of breathing space.</p> <p>It took until the 75th minute for Southampton to break Leicester down when they visited St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s in November and that was slap-bang in the middle of City\xe2\x80\x99s 13-match run without a win. They are a different proposition now but a note of caution should be sounded \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0all of a sudden expectations have changed. While before they had nothing to lose and everything to gain, now they are favourites to beat Southampton and the drop. And that brings a different kind of pressure to contend with. JA</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Ulloa continues Leicester City\xe2\x80\x99s surge   7) Four on the bounce for Manchester United? <p>Safe and sound in 12th place, Crystal Palace may not have much to play for, but anyone who thinks Manchester United will get an easy ride at a packed Selhurst Park need only cast their mind back a year when Liverpool came to town and saw their title hopes crumble in the face of an incredible comeback by a mid-table side playing as if their lives depended on avoiding defeat. Expect no quarter to be spared or given in a contest that pits together two teams managed by men with very high opinions of themselves. Desperate for the points they need to guarantee a top four finish, Manchester United travel to south-west London on the back of three consecutive defeats and there is every possibility they will depart having suffered another one. A potential Saturday evening humdinger and those who like a punt will surely be tempted by odds of 7-2 against a Palace victory.

Photograph: Michael Zemanek/BPI/Rex    <p>Having lost eight on the spin and been roundly abused by their manager and fans last weekend, Fabricio Coloccini piped up on behalf of himself and his team-mates (but pointedly not his manager) during the week through the risible medium of an open letter, pleading with supporters to give their full backing to what he claims is a fully committed team for the final three games of the season.</p> <p>As justifiably irate at their team of non-triers\xe2\x80\x99 obvious lack of effort as they have been in recent weeks, Newcastle supporters are a fairly easily pleased bunch who will rally behind their players at the first sign of fight or effort against West Brom. Sadly, all available evidence from recent weeks suggests they will be provided with little to enthuse over. Following John Carver\xe2\x80\x99s very public shaming of his players last week, it is difficult to imagine them putting in a shift at his behest. Get your popcorn ready, because after their captain\xe2\x80\x99s open letter, the reaction of up to 50,000 natives to yet another spineless surrender from their team could make for riveting viewing. BG</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Carver: \xe2\x80\x98I still think I\xe2\x80\x99m the best coach in the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa2 Newcastle expand search after Steve McClaren refuses to step in   9) Will the real Manchester City please stand up? <p>Since the turn of the year, no one has been able to guess which Manchester City will turn up at the weekend. Will it be the one that thumped Newcastle 5-0 and Stoke 4-1 back in February? Or the motley crew that surrendered at Selhurst Park, Turf Moor and Old Trafford? The team that seemed set to cruise to victory against Villa for an hour? Or the one that was lucky to avoid defeat in the final 30 minutes?</p> <p>The Manchester Evening News this week suggested that Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s position has been solidified by assurances received by Carlo Ancelotti over his future at Real Madrid. With the futures of Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9, Pablo Zabaleta, Jesus Navas, Fernando, James Milner, Samir Nasri, Bacary Sagna, Mart\xc3\xadn Demichelis, Edin Dzeko, Ga\xc3\xabl Clichy, Aleksandar Kolarov, and Stevan Jovetic all (according to various reports) uncertain and Frank Lampard finally heading off to MLS, it is perhaps no longer the manager whose future at the club is at stake over the closing weeks of season. JA</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 90% certain to leave Manchester City, says agent \xe2\x80\xa2 The Rumour Mill: Pogba to Manchester City for \xc2\xa350m?  10) The biggest ever Old Farm derby <p>Games against your local rivals are the toughest ones to cope with for fans. There is that big, juicy carrot \xe2\x80\x93 the chance to get one over on your most hated opponents. But (and this tends to loom far larger in most fans\xe2\x80\x99 consciousness) there\xe2\x80\x99s that huge spiky stick \xe2\x80\x93 the risk of the most painful of defeats. Throw in the drama and general high-tension of the play-offs and you have a recipe that will get the knees trembling on even the most stoic of supporters.</p> <p>So it\xe2\x80\x99s quite a big weekend in East Anglia. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is probably going to be the biggest derby ever between the two clubs,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Norwich manager Alex Neil about the prospect of taking on Ipswich over two legs. He\xe2\x80\x99s not wrong \xe2\x80\x93 the only tie that comes close is the Milk Cup semi-final between the teams back in 1985. There is considerably more at stake on Saturday.</p>     Norwich City\xe2\x80\x99s Lewis Grabban heads his side\xe2\x80\x99s opening goal against Ipswich Town back in August. Photograph: Nigel French/PA    <p>Recent history suggests league position and total points is a more accurate predictor of play-off semi-final success than form over the final few games, but whichever way you view it Ipswich begin as underdogs. They were pretty hapless in a 3-2 defeat to Blackburn on the final day of the season, when they knew only a win would guarantee a place in the post-season. Fortunately for Mick McCarthy and his men results elsewhere \xe2\x80\x93 namely Derby\xe2\x80\x99s capitulation at home to Reading \xe2\x80\x93 went in their favour and they scraped into the play-offs in the sixth and final spot.</p> <p>The Canaries, on the other hand, come into the game on the back of six wins and a draw in their last eight fixtures and a points tally that would have seen them promoted automatically in five of the past eight seasons (indeed their 86 points would have been enough to take the Championship title in 2007-08 and is more than Paul Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s City side mustered when they were promoted automatically in 2010-11). Alex Neil\xe2\x80\x99s 22 games in charge have yielded 15 wins and four draws. There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt who the form horse is in this race. And Norwich have already done the double over the Tractor boys this season \xe2\x80\xa6</p> <p>Elsewhere, Brentford and Middlesbrough square off on Friday evening in the other Championship semi-final first leg, while in League Two Plymouth take on Wycombe on Saturday and Stevenage face Southend on Sunday evening.
