b'Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend\xe2\x80\x99s action | Guardian sport'


b'1) Van Persie shows signs of both relief and improvement <p>An hour after the final whistle Robin van Persie was back on the pitch, with a ball at his feet. Except this time he was wearing his Manchester United blazer and polished shoes. Old Trafford was virtually empty and the place was almost in silence as he took a full XI of team-mates\xe2\x80\x99 kids on to the pitch for a little knockabout under the floodlights. He cut a relaxed figure, perhaps unaware at that point that Louis van Gaal had delivered a public rebuke for that shirt-off goal celebration, describing his player as \xe2\x80\x9cstupid\xe2\x80\x9d for inviting Phil Dowd to show his yellow card for a 10th time.</p> <p>Van Gaal was right to bring it up bearing in mind Van Persie is now only two bookings away from a suspension but the bigger story here was of a player reminding his audience of the gifts that make him such a feared opponent. Van Persie is still some way short of the form that he showed in his first season in United\xe2\x80\x99s colours but his movement and use of the ball made this one of his better performances in the Van Gaal era. The celebration after his stoppage-time equaliser felt like a release of pent-up emotion and there were at least signs of improvement in his performance.

It seems there are few things the West Ham manager likes more than explaining how he outwitted a highbrow foreign coach. His account of West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s toppling of the champions will not make easy listening for Manuel Pellegrini.</p> <p>Allardyce said West Ham took advantage of the lack of support City give Eliaquim Mangala as the summer signing adapts to the Premier League. West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s first goal was a prime example, as Alex Song dissected the City defence with a superb pass and Enner Valencia darted between Mangala and Ga\xc3\xabl Clichy before crossing for Morgan Amalfitano.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think they leave him exposed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allardyce of Mangala. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s only just joined the Premier League. They don\xe2\x80\x99t protect him and he\xe2\x80\x99s only just got here, the more and more you can get down the side of him, with the space that Clichy leaves. Kompany is used to it, he\xe2\x80\x99s been at this level for such a long time, this lad\xe2\x80\x99s not, he\xe2\x80\x99s finding his feet and, like I said, we made big strides down that left-hand side and we caused them lots of problems.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mangala was imperious in his Premier League debut at home to Chelsea in September but has been less convincing since then, notably in the 4-2 win at Hull and again at Upton Park. Allardyce reckons teams will continue to take advantage, especially on the road, if City do not adapt. \xe2\x80\x9cThey come away from home expecting to win and go and attack you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a lot this season how those spaces they leave can be exploited by other teams.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mangala\xe2\x80\x99s teething troubles are reminiscent of those endured last season by Mart\xc3\xadn Demichelis, who seemed ill at ease in his first couple of months in English football but gradually improved to demonstrate what an accomplished defender he really is. Pellegrini no doubt hopes Mangala will get to grips with the Premier League in the same way and, if he does come to anticipate danger as well as the Argentinian, then Mangala\xe2\x80\x99s greater speed and strength will make him a formidable asset. Paul Doyle </p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Allardyce: City could not cope with us\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: West Ham 2-1 Manchester City</p>  3) Moses continues to fall short of potential heights   <div data-embed-type="table" class="player-card player-card--football" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <div class="player-card__image-container">  </div> <div class="player-card__player"> <div class="player-card__position" itemprop="jobTitle">Midfielder</div> <div class="player-card__name" itemprop="name">Victor Moses</div> </div> <dl class="player-card__stats"> <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Appearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">7</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Goals</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">0</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">9</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots on target</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">44%</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Offsides</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">0</dd> </dl> </div>   <p>Victor Moses had Stoke City\xe2\x80\x99s best moment during their 1-0 defeat at Southampton when he went close to scoring an excellent solo goal, only to shoot tamely at Fraser Forster after shaking off his marker. Yet otherwise he struggled to influence the game and was substituted in the second half. Although Mark Hughes refused to criticise him, saying Moses has done well for Stoke so far, the winger still needs to be more consistent to make the most of his undoubted talent. He has terrific ability, which is why he has played for Chelsea and Liverpool, but there are times when he drifts through matches, the frustration heightened by the sense that he can offer so much more.

After conceding eight goals at Southampton last week Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s goalkeeper made an appalling stoppage time error to hand Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s second goal at the Stadium of Light on Saturday. To make such a mistake against his former club only exacerbated Mannone\xe2\x80\x99s evident pain and Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger made a point of expressing his post-match sympathy for a good man and, usually, a very good keeper. In recent weeks, though, Mannone has seemed a little more nervous than last season. Perhaps it is because Costel Pantilimon has been waiting, patiently, in the wings. Previously Joe Hart\xe2\x80\x99s understudy at Manchester City, the towering Romanian joined Sunderland in the summer and will surely start what has become an immensely important Premier League game at Crystal Palace next Monday.

Or Tim Sherwood. Goodness knows, we have heard the soundbite before from a Tottenham Hotspur manager. But it was Mauricio Pochettino and, as he gave vent to the frustration after the 2-1 home defeat by Newcastle United on Sunday, he covered extremely familiar ground in the lament about the squad\xe2\x80\x99s lack of a winning mentality.</p> <p>Pochettino says that \xe2\x80\x9cphysically and tactically\xe2\x80\x9d the team has improved since he took over in the summer, which is a moot point in itself, but he remains desperate to erase the kind of game management lapses that allowed, in this case, the opposition to equalise from a long ball six seconds into the second half and turn the game.</p> <p>But how can such psychological issues be best tackled? \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to speak, we need to create a different situation on the training ground and work,\xe2\x80\x9d Pochettino said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know how but, always, you need to spend time to work in this area. It is not the same as in physical or tactical situations. It is a different area.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The answers continue to be elusive. David Hytner</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Tottenham 1-2 Newcastle\xe2\x80\xa2 Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s harsh words inspire Newcastle turnaround</p>  6) Why only Mario? <p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s give Mario Balotelli a break for a while. What about the rest of Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s summer signings? Adam Lallana was substituted against Hull after failing to impose himself on the game, not for the first time this season. Emre Can was tidy but anonymous in midfield and also departed early. Dejan Lovren helped keep a much-needed clean sheet but was not up against the most determined of attacks and has spent most of the season so far struggling to live up to his \xc2\xa320m price tag. That is a lot of money for a defender and Liverpool spent the same on Lazar Markovic, who has yet to suggest he can be more than a bit part player or impact substitute.</p> <p>The total cost of the above foursome is \xc2\xa375m, almost exactly what Liverpool received for Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez. Replacing the Uruguayan was always going to be tricky but in the overall scheme of things the \xc2\xa316m shelled out on Balotelli is neither here nor there. The Italian makes a convenient scapegoat or distraction \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cwhipping boy\xe2\x80\x9d was Steve Bruce\xe2\x80\x99s description \xe2\x80\x93 but again the question needs to be asked: why always him? Or more to the point, why only him? Paul Wilson</p>           Mario Balotelli unlucky against Hull City, says Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Brendan Rodgers     <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Balotelli leads Rodgers up blind alley\xe2\x80\xa2 Rodgers defends goal-shy Balotelli\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Liverpool 0-0 Hull City\xe2\x80\xa2 Su\xc3\xa1rez: me and my big mouth\xe2\x80\xa2 The exclusive first extract from Su\xc3\xa1rez\xe2\x80\x99s book</p>  7) Neil Warnock should accept officials\xe2\x80\x99 failings <p>It is true that Crystal Palace were on the wrong end of some poor refereeing decisions against West Bromwich Albion but that does not make Neil Warnock\xe2\x80\x99s complaints about Mark Clattenberg any less risible. Referees do not make deliberate mistakes but they do make mistakes; that is in the nature of football and not necessarily to its detriment. And, in any event, the only way to deserve to win a game is to win a game; a team must be good enough to eliminate the influence of officials from this equation. If only managers were as strident in criticising themselves and their players as they are decisions made in good faith; those who accept responsibility are more likely to take responsibility. Daniel Harris</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: West Brom 2-2 Crystal Palace</p>  8) Will Burnley win a game this season? <p>Derby County were the worst team in Premier League history. Their side of 2007-08 mustered a mere 11 points. But even they won a game. A quarter of the way into the current campaign, Burnley have four draws, five defeats and no victories. They have been ahead for only three minutes, scored only five goals and looked like a wonderfully committed side who just lack the quality that every opponent possesses. \xe2\x80\x9cBurnley are very unfortunate they have not got more wins because their effort deserves wins,\xe2\x80\x9d said Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez after his Everton side won 3-1 at Turf Moor. But effort alone is not translated into points and, with every game, it is getting harder to see when and where their elusive win will come. While it seemed premature when Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho was fielding questions about Chelsea becoming Invincibles, it may be similarly early and very unfair to pose the question: Will Burnley complete their Premier League campaign without beating anyone? Richard Jolly</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Burnley 1-3 Everton</p>  9) Garry Monk\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely transfer coup   <div data-embed-type="table" class="player-card player-card--football" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <div class="player-card__image-container">  </div> <div class="player-card__player"> <div class="player-card__position" itemprop="jobTitle">Midfielder</div> <div class="player-card__name" itemprop="name">Gylfi Sigurdsson</div> </div> <dl class="player-card__stats"> <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Appearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">9</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Free Kicks</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">14</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Corners</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">17</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Crosses</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">17</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Assists</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">7</dd> </dl> </div>   <p>When Swansea brought Gylfi Sigurdsson back to the Liberty Stadium in the summer, with Ben Davies and Michel Vorm moving in the opposite direction to Tottenham, many felt the Welsh club had got the raw end of the deal. Yet here we are, nearly into November, and, while Sigurdsson has thrived in his second spell in south Wales, Davies and Vorm have yet to start a Premier League fixture for Spurs. Sigurdsson\xe2\x80\x99s influence was clear to see against Leicester; he was a central creative force in both goals. For the first he brilliantly anticipated Wilfried Bony\xe2\x80\x99s backheel and then unselfishly returned the ball to the striker to score. It was Sigurdsson\xe2\x80\x99s seventh assist of the season. For the second his slide-rule pass sent Jefferson Montero scurrying into the Leicester box to tee up Bony again. On this evidence Swansea and Garry Monk may have pulled off one of the transfer coups of the summer. Andrew Gwilym</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Swansea City 2-0 Leicester City</p>  10) West Ham on Song against the champions <p>What on earth is Alex Song doing at West Ham? OK, Song was not quite up to it at Barcelona but there is no shame in that and it is a surprise that bigger clubs did not show more interest in him once it became clear that he was available. But credit to West Ham for pulling that deal off. Song has been excellent since making his debut last month, comfortable on the ball and leading by example, and ran the midfield against Manchester City, going toe-to-toe with Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 and Fernando and coming out on top. He even had the audacity to pull a rabona out of the bag, which led to an opportunity for Stewart Downing in the second half. He is clearly enjoying playing again after two forgettable years in Spain.
