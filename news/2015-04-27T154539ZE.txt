b'Eibar press conference hits buffers as language barrier comes again to the fore | Sid Lowe'


b'<p>Gaizka Garitano is Basque. A fan of Bruce Springsteen, Liverpool and Jamie Carragher, who spent Boxing Day morning at Chelsea v West Ham and Boxing Day afternoon at Arsenal v QPR as a supporter, not a scout, but Basque. A man who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t just have one Basque surname but eight of them, going back through the generations. Gaizka Garitano Aguirre Urkizu Asla Zubikarai Madariaga Garraminia Arteche was born in Euskadi, raised in Euskadi and played in Euskadi, for pretty much the whole of his career and for pretty much the whole of Euskadi: first Athletic Bilbao then Real Sociedad, Deportivo Alav\xc3\xa9s and Eibar. A member at Athletic, shareholder at Real, he\xe2\x80\x99s manager at Eibar. Their most successful manager ever, in fact.</p> <p>Garitano is 39 and has only been head coach for two and a half years, but he has taken his team to successive promotions and into the top division for the first time. Now he\xe2\x80\x99s fighting to stay there, attempting to stretch the miracle over another season. Before that, he was a footballer for 16 seasons, 14 of them in Euskadi. Had he not been, he would have been a bertsolari, a Basque street poet. Football got in the way and anyway, he says, he may not have been good enough: those guys are geniuses, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Messi and Ronaldo\xe2\x80\x9d of improvised verse. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir use of language is incredible,\xe2\x80\x9d Garitano told World Soccer. As for his use of language, that became news this weekend. And the reaction to it was incredible too.</p> <p>It was Sunday afternoon in Almer\xc3\xada and Eibar had just lost 2-0, thanks to goals from Thievy Bifouma and Verza; a huge victory for Almer\xc3\xada and a disastrous defeat for Eibar. What, journalists wondered, would the managers have to say about it? The answer, in Garitano\xe2\x80\x99s case, was: not much. And what little he managed to say, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand. Which was basically the problem. And it was not just the euskera they didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to understand.</p> <p>Garitano eased into his seat in the press room at the Juegos Mediterr\xc3\xa1neos stadium, behind the bottles of beer and coke and energy drinks in electric blue, and the first question came in. A Basque TV channel, ETB, asked it, in Basque. A Basque manager of a Basque football team, who might not have had what it takes to become a bertsolari but who expresses himself well in Basque, whose first language is Basque and who speaks Basque at home, answered it. In Basque. Which, by the way, is one of four official languages of the Spanish state, according to article three of the constitution. Just as he has answered Basque questions with Basque answers in the 65 press conferences he had previously held this season without it ever being a problem; just as others had done before him; and just as the press officer had said he would.</p> <p>This was how it would run and how it always runs: Garitano would answer Basque questions in Basque and then Spanish (castellano) questions in Spanish. They\xe2\x80\x99d all get the chance to ask what they wanted and the chance to get the answer in the language they wanted. For two Almer\xc3\xada-based journalists, though, it was not enough. And so it started. \xe2\x80\x9cBai,\xe2\x80\x9d Garitano began \xe2\x80\x93 yes, in Basque. But soon his eyes were drawn to his right where someone was grumbling. He paused, staring ahead. Sitting alongside him, Almer\xc3\xada\xe2\x80\x99s press officer Juanjo Moreno spoke up, reiterating Garitano would respond to questions in castellano too, that bilingual press conferences were nothing new and bemoaning \xe2\x80\x9ca lack of respect\xe2\x80\x9d from the journalists. But it did no good.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSorry, m\xc3\xadster. Go ahead ...\xe2\x80\x9d Moreno added and Garitano began again. This time the grumbling came from someone to his left and Garitano paused again.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIs there are problem? Is there a problem?\xe2\x80\x9d he shot.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEh?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIs there a problem or something?\xe2\x80\x9d Garitano repeated.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there\xe2\x80\x99s a problem: we don\xe2\x80\x99t understand a word.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Again, Moreno intervened. \xe2\x80\x9cLook, se\xc3\xb1ores,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the first division for six years and Barcelona have been here and there are questions in Catalan and questions in Spanish. I just don\xe2\x80\x99t get what you\xe2\x80\x99re complaining about.\xe2\x80\x9d As he was talking, Garitano got up and walked silently out the room. Moreno rose too, raised his arms in incredulity, shot a look at the journalists that said \xe2\x80\x9cyou idiots\xe2\x80\x9d and headed after the Eibar coach. \xe2\x80\x9cThis way, mister,\xe2\x80\x9d he called out, signalling the exit. It was all over.</p> <p>Soon it was all over everywhere, an uncomfortable reminder of the way that linguistic debates are sometimes framed here, with the criticism for Garitano emerging from familiar sources. The immense majority supported Garitano and praised the reaction of Almer\xc3\xada\xe2\x80\x99s press officer in his defence, barely able to believe that in 2015 some journalists exhibit attitudes that echo another era. Others could believe it too well: there was something depressingly predictable in Garitano\xe2\x80\x99s use of Euskera, as often happens with Catalan or Galego too, being interpreted by some as an implicit threat, as if it was a determined, deliberate and provocative political stance. ABC accused him of \xe2\x80\x9cinsisting\xe2\x80\x9d on speaking Euskera even though \xe2\x80\x9cthe majority of Almer\xc3\xada journalists, like the majority of Basques, do not speak it.\xe2\x80\x9d Marca suggested he had \xe2\x80\x9clacked sensitivity\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccommon sense\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Yet they had missed the point and if anyone lacked sensitivity it was the journalists who interrupted, demonstrating an attitude as aggressive as it was antiquated. Garitano has expressed his support for the idea of Basque independence before, he was not doing so here: there is little threat, little statement, in speaking Basque to a Basque TV channel after a football match, in replying to a question in the language in which it was asked.</p> <p>Above all, the journalists\xe2\x80\x99 complaints were very daft, showing not only a lack of respect towards Garitano but towards their colleagues too. They complained at not being able to do their job by preventing others doing their job. If the first grumble could be forgiven, put down to ignorance of the protocol to be followed, the second could not. It could be put down to ignorance, full stop. Garitano has a degree in journalism and, far from obstructing journalists\xe2\x80\x99 work, he was facilitating it. Harmful? Helpful, more like. Until he walked, at least \xe2\x80\x93 and that decision is questionable of course. Surely a journalist can understand the value to another journalist of an answer in the language they can broadcast? The only obstructive people were those two journalists; when Garitano walked, they all went without.</p> <p>They had been told that they would get their chance, in the language they chose; all they had to do was be patient. There was nothing preventing them from asking him to explain what he had said in Basque, to effectively be his own translator. It has happened before. At every press conference there are questions in Euskera and in castellano; there are more, much more, in the latter. At none of those press conferences have there been any limits applied, no quotas imposed. Almer\xc3\xada\xe2\x80\x99s press officer said it best: \xe2\x80\x9cI just don\xe2\x80\x99t get what you\xe2\x80\x99re complaining about.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t let me answer; I tried two or three times but they didn\xe2\x80\x99t let me. And when that happens, you go,\xe2\x80\x9d Garitano explained later. His tone was conciliatory and a bit baffled. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery week I answer questions in Euskera and there\xe2\x80\x99s never been any problem. If I had refused to speak in Spanish, that would be different but I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t and never would. That has never happened. If I am asked in Euskera, I reply in Euskera. If I\xe2\x80\x99m asked in castellano, I reply in castellano. And if I\xe2\x80\x99m asked in English, I try that too. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. There\xe2\x80\x99s no issue [there]; the issue is that we lost and we\xe2\x80\x99re in a delicate position,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded.</p> <p>Eibar certainly are. This weekend, Levante overtook them into 15th place, pulling a point ahead. Defeat in Almer\xc3\xada saw their opponents catch them too, leaving both teams on 31 points (although Eibar have a head to head advantage and Almer\xc3\xada may still have three points deducted over their debt to Danish side Aalborg). On Monday, Eibar sit 16th, two points above the bottom three, and by next Monday they\xe2\x80\x99re likely to be in the relegation zone: in midweek they face Sevilla and then at the weekend they play Valencia. There are five games to go and they are desperately hanging on.</p>     Almeria\xe2\x80\x99s midfielder Javier Espinosa, right, battles with Abraham Minero during Eibar\xe2\x80\x99s 2-0 defeat on Sunday. Photograph: Carlos Barba/EPA    <p>Hope comes from their final three fixtures after this week: Espanyol, Getafe and C\xc3\xb3rdoba, three sides with nothing to play for. Recent form, though, only deepens the pessimism. Eibar are where they expected to be. They may even be better off than they expected to be. The smallest team in the division, it is a miracle that they are here at all. To have reached week 33 with a two-point gap between them and a relegation zone that they have not yet entered is a huge success. At Christmas, they lost Ra\xc3\xbal Albentosa to Derby County, the Championship club that could offer him a salary six times what he was on at Eibar. \xe2\x80\x9cWe tried to convince him to wait until the end of the season at least but they said \xe2\x80\x98now or never\xe2\x80\x99 and he deserved the move,\xe2\x80\x9d Garitano said.</p> <p>At that point, few foresaw this collapse. At the half-way stage, when everyone had played everyone once, Eibar were eighth. They were the Basque country\xe2\x80\x99s best team. Garitano warned the problem may come when they saw themselves as a first division team and at that point they did. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not shameful or problematic to feel inferior,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s anything to hide from. It\xe2\x80\x99s good to know what you\xe2\x80\x99re up against. The day that you play de tu a tu, as equals, you lose something. We can\xe2\x80\x99t forget where we come from; the day we forget that, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a problem.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Since then Athletic Bilbao have surpassed them and so have Real Sociedad. Seven others have done the same, Levante the latest of them, and the fear now is two more will do so too. As the Diario Vasco put it, they\xe2\x80\x99re heading \xe2\x80\x9cdownhill and the brakes don\xe2\x80\x99t work.\xe2\x80\x9d In week 19, Eibar had won seven, drawn six and lost six. Since then, they have won once. They have lost 12 of 14 games since the halfway stage, picking up four of 42 points and scoring just four times.</p> <p>It is hard to explain what has happened. Maybe Eibar have just reached their natural level; survival, which should have been impossible, is still possible. Maybe they allowed themselves to believe, like everyone else did, that it was all over. Maybe ill-fortune, individual mistakes \xe2\x80\x93 there have been plenty of them \xe2\x80\x93 and refereeing decisions have as well. Maybe their confidence has gone. Maybe it is a mix of all those things. Maybe. Maybe someone should ask their manager. And maybe this time they\xe2\x80\x99ll let him finish.</p> Talking points <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 For about an hour Celta v Real Madrid was superb: chaotic, open, and very fast. 1-0, 1-1, 1-2, 2-2 it went ... all in the first 27 minutes. James Rodr\xc3\xadguez made it 2-3 just before half-time and then there was a penalty shout for Celta to make it 3-3. Instead, Javier Hern\xc3\xa1ndez scored a brilliant second \xe2\x80\x93 he\xe2\x80\x99s running at better than a goal a game now \xe2\x80\x93 to make it 4-2 with 20 minutes to go. And there it ended. Until then, there had been chances at both ends and huge wide open spaces, Celta racing round the pitch, Madrid racing after them and into the gaps they had left behind. There were 29 shots and Berizzo said he was happy that his team had been so \xe2\x80\x9cfaithful\xe2\x80\x9d to the way they play. Nolito in particular was superb, driving Madrid mad from the left. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t bad off the pitch either. Asked about the penalty claim, he said: \xe2\x80\x9ctalking about referees is like asking the lemon tree for cup cakes.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 As one genius put it: \xe2\x80\x9crubbish derby: no away fans, no home team.\xe2\x80\x9d That might be an exaggeration but there was something a bit flat about Espanyol v Barcelona, thanks largely to the fact Luis Enrique\xe2\x80\x99s side were just too good. 2-0 up at half-time thanks to two brilliant goals (albeit Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez was offside when he provided the pass for the second), Barcelona overcame the last of their opponents in this recent run of tough games, dubbed The Tourmalet by some: Celta, (Almer\xc3\xada), Sevilla, Valencia, Espanyol. They had dropped points just once: in Seville. That day they \xe2\x80\x9clost half a title,\xe2\x80\x9d the headlines said. This time they had won it back again. This win was \xe2\x80\x9chalf a title,\xe2\x80\x9d Mundo Deportivo said. Real Madrid now embark on the same run, although their performance in Vigo, where Barcelona were fortunate to win 1-0, shows that they are certainly not about to give up. There are still just two points in it.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Where have all the goals gone? Villarreal, the team who went 16 league games scoring for fun have now scored once in their last seven.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Antoine Griezmann: c\xe2\x80\x99est fantastique. Or something. His 22 league goals for Atl\xc3\xa9tico are more than any Frenchman has ever scored in La Liga before ... and would make him top scorer in any league other than Spain.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\x9cSevilla sleep in the Champions League,\xe2\x80\x9d as one headline had it. Valencia can take that place off them tonight though.</p> Results <p>C\xc3\xb3rdoba 0-1 Athletic Bilbao</p> <p>Espanyol 0-2 Barcelona</p> <p>Atl\xc3\xa9tico 3-0 Elche</p> <p>Getafe 0-1 Levante</p> <p>Real Sociedad 0-0 Villarreal</p> <p>M\xc3\xa1laga 1-1 Deportivo de La Coru\xc3\xb1a</p> <p>Almer\xc3\xada 2-0 Eibar</p> <p>Sevilla 2-0 Rayo Vallecano</p> <p>Celta Vigo 2-4 Real Madrid</p> <p>Tonight: Valencia v Granada</p>'
