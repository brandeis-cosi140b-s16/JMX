b'<p>Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 came to Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s rescue again just as the defending champions were labouring in the second half and looking short of attacking ideas. With David Silva still injured and Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero having a quiet game City\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to stay in touch with Chelsea at the top of the Premier League were not amounting to much until their influential midfielder suddenly found the energy for one of his trademark bursts into the area.</p> <p>Tour\xc3\xa9 had not been having a particularly impressive game up until that point, and when he is below his best City usually are too, but when Fernandinho set him up with a nonchalant back heel into the area just after the hour mark there was no stopping the Ivorian.</p> <p>Storming into the area Tour\xc3\xa9 latched on to the ball and placed a low shot into Lukasz Fabianski\xe2\x80\x99s bottom corner almost without breaking stride. It was Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s first league goal of the season at the Etihad, an indication of how out of sorts he has been, and only once in front did City show the sort of attacking confidence and expansiveness they will need to have any hope of catching Chelsea.</p> <p>City could not add to their lead in the half-hour or so that remained, though only through Fabianski\xe2\x80\x99s excellence in keeping out a late effort from Jes\xc3\xbas Navas. At least they looked as if they believed in themselves and knew the way to goal, a vast improvement on the first half, and they must find a way of keeping the same momentum going to have any chance against Bayern Munich on Tuesday, when Tour\xc3\xa9 will be suspended. They also need to work on their concentration in defence.</p>     Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 scores Man City\xe2\x80\x99s second goal past Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s Lucasz Fabianski in the Premier League at the Etihad. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA    <p>Improved though City were in the second half, they might still have been pegged back at the end when Swansea came agonisingly close with a deflected free kick, or when Wilfried Bony played Baf\xc3\xa9timbi Gomis through on goal. Joe Hart came out quickly and did just enough to put off the substitute, though a more experienced striker would have made more of the opportunity. City must have been relieved it was not Gomis playing in Bony, for Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s main striker had already shown his finishing prowess in the opening minutes.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf we had scored a third goal it might have made the last five minutes easier,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel Pellegrini said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut considering we started off a goal down we played well and created a lot of chances. Defending is something we work every day to improve, and I hope we don\xe2\x80\x99t make the same sort of mistakes when we face a difficult team like Bayern Munich.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The home side had got off to an uncertain start when Swansea took the lead with a goal against the run of play after nine minutes. It was not that City had been piling on the pressure at the other end, they had not, but the visitors had shown little attacking endeavour until Bony and Nathan Dyer combined neatly for the former to find plenty of space in which to beat Hart. Bony supplied Dyer in the first place then moved forward, Dyer delayed the return pass until just the right moment for his team-mate to stay onside, then picked up his run with the deftest of chipped diagonal passes. The defence could only watch as Bony brought the ball down then turned to shoot past the goalkeeper.</p> <p>It was not the show of strength Pellegrini had been looking for pre-Bayern, but City remained calm and stuck to their task of gradually wearing Swansea down. They drew level midway through the first half when after a patient build-up, Tour\xc3\xa9 supplied Navas on the right, and Stevan Jovetic just about stayed onside to flick a teasing cross beyond Fabianski.</p> <p>By the interval the Swansea goalkeeper was keeping his side in it. He showed quick reactions on the half-hour to deny Ag\xc3\xbcero when a great ball from Samir Nasri had put him through on goal, then on the stroke of half-time his outstretched fingertips pushed a tremendous 30 yard drive from Ga\xc3\xabl Clichy on to his left upright.</p> <p>A couple of more routine saves, both from Jovetic, ensured the teams turned round level, though Swansea were possibly lucky to start the second half with the same number of players as City after an incident on the half-hour when Kyle Bartley appeared to strike Ag\xc3\xbcero. The two players came together well away from the ball, so the referee understandably failed to see what happened, but Ag\xc3\xbcero first fell to the ground, then got up angrily to confront \xc3\x80ngel Rangel. That appeared to be a case of mistaken identity, if a foul had taken place Bartley was the culprit, and the Swansea defender had already been booked for a challenge on the same player.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a hard place to come and that\xe2\x80\x99s the closest we\xe2\x80\x99ve been to a result,\xe2\x80\x9d Garry Monk said. \xe2\x80\x9cConsidering we were relegation favourites at the start of the season we are not doing so bad. We had to do some last-ditch defending in the second half when City got going, but we had chances of our own at the end. We could possibly have taken a point.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
