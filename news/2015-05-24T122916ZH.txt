b'How does Raheem Sterling score against Ronaldo and Messi at 20? | Sean Ingle'


b'<p>Fingers on buzzers for a quickfire numbers round: \xc2\xa335,000 a week; \xc2\xa3100,000 a week; \xe2\x80\x9cHe is not signing for \xc2\xa3700,000, \xc2\xa3800,000, \xc2\xa3900,000 a week.\xe2\x80\x9d Name the footballer. You knew instantly that it was Raheem Sterling \xe2\x80\x93 and the figures were, in turn, his current salary, Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s new contract offer, and the dismissive response of his agent, Aidy Ward. Meanwhile Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s potential transfer fee increasingly seems subject to Weimar Republic levels of hyperinflation \xe2\x80\x93 from \xc2\xa340m earlier in the week to \xc2\xa360m in one Sunday paper.</p> <p>Meanwhile the country appears split down the middle. On the one hand we have Sterling the wunderkind, who made his England debut at 17 and won Europe\xe2\x80\x99s Golden Boy 2014. On the other, there are the doomsayers who warn that he might be another Aaron Lennon, his football talents prematurely frozen in carbonite. As one poster on a Liverpool forum put it recently: \xe2\x80\x9cHis shooting has been poor, his crossing poor, and the only thing he was good at was taking selfies on his mid-season holiday.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Then there are the professional fence\xe2\x80\x91sitters, who fatuously state that Sterling is a work in progress. Of course he is \xe2\x80\x93 he\xe2\x80\x99s 20. Even Cristiano Ronaldo and Leo Messi were at that age. A far more interesting exercise is to try to figure out how Sterling compares with other top attacking midfielders/wing forwards when they were 20 \xe2\x80\x93 and that requires a broader range of figures than ones with pound signs and rows of zeros after them.</p> <p>So far in his Premier League career Sterling has scored 18 goals in 95 games (a rate of 0.23 goals per 90 minutes) and 14 assists (0.18 per 90 minutes). This season \xe2\x80\x93 during which he has turned 20 \xe2\x80\x93 he has seven goals, seven assists and has created 75 chances in 35 games. Those numbers are pretty good. Especially given Liverpool have lost Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez, been largely without Daniel Sturridge, and have seen Steven Gerrard coming out much the worse from a crunching challenge with Father Time.</p> <p>In particular those 75 chances created stand out. The season Ronaldo turned 20, he created 49 chances in 33 games for Manchester United, and Messi managed 40 from 28 matches. David Silva registered 40 from 34 matches, Gareth Bale 39 from 23 matches and Theo Walcott 22 from 25 matches. Sterling trumps them all.</p> <p>Indeed, only Eden Hazard and Mesut \xc3\x96zil posted better chance creation numbers at the same age. And remember, Sterling did this in a Liverpool side that struggled to get past 50 Premier League goals. Last season they scored 101.</p> <p>Admittedly, Sterling isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite at the very top table when you rank players based on their goals and assists by the age of 20. Lionel Messi stands alone (he was scoring nearly three goals every four games even then) with Hazard and Arjen Robben the next best, albeit in the weaker Ligue 1 and Eredivisie. But Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s numbers either match up, or are better than, everyone else in his position.</p> <p>The comparisons with Sterling and Ronaldo at 20 are also worth exploring. At that age Ronaldo was not the goalscoring terminator he is now. According to Opta, he had played 64 Premier League games, scoring nine goals (0.2 per 90 minutes) and creating eight assists (0.18 per 90 minutes). Of course these numbers don\xe2\x80\x99t tell you everything. Ronaldo was already an immense talent. He had starred in an FA Cup final and had a decent Euro 2004. But at 20 his raw numbers weren\xe2\x80\x99t any better than Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s. He certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a world beater.</p> <p>There are other caveats, too. Young players mature at different rates, and past performance is not always a guarantee of future success. But as Omar Chaudhuri, the head of football intelligence at 21st Club points out, Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s numbers have not been inflated by unsustainable hot streaks, which therefore makes what we have seen so far a decent indicator of what will happen from now on.</p> <p>Chaudhuri, who works with several top European clubs, also makes another point. When it comes to highly rated young players, the transfer market has often got it right. He points to the list of the 25 most expensive under-23 signings in history. The top five? Neymar, James Rodr\xc3\xadguez, Gianluigi Buffon, Rio Ferdinand and Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero. Wayne Rooney, Fernando Torres (from Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid to Liverpool), Hazard, Robben and Ronaldinho are also on the list.</p> <p>There are duds in there too \xe2\x80\x93 Andy Carroll for one. But there are far fewer mistakes than in the list of big-money transfers from 23-30, which includes Kak\xc3\xa1\xe2\x80\x99s transfer to Real Madrid. Torres\xe2\x80\x99s move to Chelsea, Gaizka Mendieta\xe2\x80\x99s move to Lazio and many other flops.</p> <p>As Chaudhuri puts it: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s also interesting that a lot of prodigies in Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s position \xe2\x80\x93 Ronaldo, Hazard, Mata, Bale, \xc3\x96zil \xe2\x80\x93 were at least 21 before they made their first big-money move, which tells us a couple of things. First, that clubs are already willing to spend big on Sterling \xe2\x80\x93 and probably have been for a year, so since he\xe2\x80\x99s been 19 \xe2\x80\x93 reflects his ability and potential. And second that his value is likely to be nowhere near its peak.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Does this mean Sterling will develop into one of the best players in the world? We can\xe2\x80\x99t be certain. But we can say this. There is an enormous amount to like about his football already and the odds are that he will get much better.</p>'
