b'Newcastle look for overseas manager but no imminent appointment expected'


b'<p> </p> <p>With Newcastle United determined to take their time over appointing a manager, John Carver is expected to continue in caretaker charge for not only Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Chelsea but the home game against Southampton the following weekend.</p> <p>Although Newcastle remain interested in R\xc3\xa9mi Garde and are understood to have made informal contact with the former Lyon manager and Arsenal defensive midfielder, other candidates cannot be discounted. These include Thomas Tuchel, the former Mainz coach, and Saint-\xc3\x89tienne\xe2\x80\x99s Christophe Galtier. Both are believed to be under consideration.</p> <p>As things stand, Lee Charnley, the club\xe2\x80\x99s managing director, and Graham Carr, the chief scout \xe2\x80\x93 the duo the club\xe2\x80\x99s owner, Mike Ashley, has placed in charge of the recruitment process \xe2\x80\x93 hope to be in a position to announce an Ashley-approved head coach shortly after the Southampton game.</p> <p>With Newcastle out of the FA Cup this would mean the new man will have the best part of a fortnight to work with his squad before the trip to Hull City at the end of January.</p> <p>It seems virtually certain Alan Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s successor will be imported from abroad after Steve McClaren pledged his loyalty to Derby County on Tuesday and Eddie Howe on Wednesday said he would not contemplate leaving the Championship leaders, Bournemouth.</p> <p>Newcastle regarded McClaren as a strong contender but the former England and Middlesbrough manager\xe2\x80\x99s comments appear to have ruled out any possibility of his relocating to Tyneside.</p> <p>Although Howe was seen as more of an outsider, his name is believed to have featured on Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s longlist. Not that the 37-year-old was ever prepared to consider walking out on Bournemouth\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to reach the Premier League.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s flattering but I have no interest in other jobs,\xe2\x80\x9d Howe said. \xe2\x80\x9cI love the job I\xe2\x80\x99m doing here.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Alan Shearer has hinted he wondered whether Ashley had encouraged Pardew to depart for Crystal Palace after possibly telling him he would shortly be putting the sold signs up at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park in order to pursue his increasingly complicated involvement with Rangers.</p> <p>Although this theory is contradicted by emphatic denials from Newcastle that Ashley, who recently said he would not consider selling up on Tyneside until the summer of 2016 at the very earliest, is preparing for a sale, Shearer did not seem entirely convinced.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what [Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s intentions for the club are] because he never tells us anything,\xe2\x80\x9d said the former Newcastle striker and caretaker manager in a BBC interview. \xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t speak to anyone but there\xe2\x80\x99s a small part of me that thinks he might have given Alan Pardew a nod.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Quite apart from Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s insistence that Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s statement about remaining in control for at least the next 18 months remains accurate, offloading football clubs is difficult.</p> <p>Moreover, as Shearer pointed out, there are several other plausible explanations for Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s defection. \xe2\x80\x9cIt did make me laugh when I heard people saying that Alan wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave Newcastle to go to Crystal Palace,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a million reasons why Alan would leave Newcastle to go to Crystal Palace: he\xe2\x80\x99d be on a better salary at a club where the fans would want him, he would buy and sell the players he wanted. There\xe2\x80\x99s four very good reasons to start with. That\xe2\x80\x99s where Newcastle are as a club I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid. Not good news but we\xe2\x80\x99re used to that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
