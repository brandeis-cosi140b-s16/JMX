b'Mourinho may clash with FA again over Ivanovic <p>Should Branislav Ivanovic be charged with violent conduct? Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho, inevitably, says no. Yet Mourinho gives the impression that if one of his players were caught stealing flowers from a graveside he would excuse them on the grounds they were taking them to be watered. Ivanovic lost his control and there is one television angle where he can clearly be seen, having already grabbed James McCarthy by the throat, ramming his head into his opponent from close range. Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez says it is a clear red card. Over to the FA\xe2\x80\x99s disciplinary department \xe2\x80\x93 and prepare for the monumental strop from Mourinho if the correct decision is made. Daniel Taylor</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Chelsea 1-0 Everton  \xe2\x80\xa2 Mourinho walks out of BBC interview over Ivanovic questions  United\xe2\x80\x99s blunt attack needs Rooney revamp <p>Louis van Gaal said it himself: three Manchester United goals from three set pieces. They count too, we work on them in training, the United manager added, possibly preparing himself to follow \xe2\x80\x9clong ball-gate\xe2\x80\x9d with a defence of \xe2\x80\x9cset piece-gate\xe2\x80\x9d. There should be no need when United have such a wealth of attacking talent \xe2\x80\x93 Juan Mata did not even get a look in against Burnley \xe2\x80\x93 but Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s justification for keeping Wayne Rooney in midfield is becoming increasingly mystifying when it is clear Radamel Falcao is not as sharp as he ought to be and Robin van Persie is out of form. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can ask me the same question every week, it is for me to decide,\xe2\x80\x9d Van Gaal said when the Rooney question reared its head. \xe2\x80\x9cI have to compare him with Falcao, Van Persie and James Wilson and look for the best balance. Rooney has showed he can play in every position. He may be better as a striker, but then I would have a problem in midfield.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>   <div data-embed-type="table" class="player-card player-card--football" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <div class="player-card__image-container">  </div> <div class="player-card__player"> <div class="player-card__position" itemprop="jobTitle">Striker</div> <div class="player-card__name" itemprop="name">Wayne Rooney</div> </div> <dl class="player-card__stats"> <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Appearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">21</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Goals</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">8</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">43</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots on target</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">30%</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Offsides</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">7</dd> </dl> </div>   <p>Yet Van Gaal has Adnan Januzaj, \xc3\x81ngel di Mar\xc3\xada, Mata, Daley Blind, Ashley Young, Ander Herrera and Marouane Fellaini for midfield, not to mention Michael Carrick to return from injury. The United manager is right, Rooney can play anywhere, though his midfield contributions have not been so startling that his selection in that role must be automatic. Far from it. Van Gaal admitted that the main problem against Burnley had been an inability to retain the ball in midfield and break out of the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 press.</p> <p>Rooney ought not to be immune from that implied criticism. The England captain may no longer be the unstoppable force in a striking position that many United supporters believe, but it is hard to see how he could fail to be an improvement on what Van Gaal has up front at the moment. Nor is it easy to understand why Herrera, Mata and Fellaini, bought so recently for large sums of money, are getting so little game time. Paul Wilson</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Manchester United 3-1 Burnley  \xe2\x80\xa2 Louis van Gaal v Sam Allardyce: who is right and what is a long ball anyway?  Reality check for Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s bright young things <p>There was encouragement for Roy Hodgson at Anfield on Tuesday with nine English players among the 22 starters (although one\xe2\x80\x99s international future involves no more than a move to Los Angeles), for Brendan Rodgers with eight of Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s starting lineup being 25 or under and for Mauricio Pochettino in Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s evidently improved resilience and character in this fixture. Whether it has reached the level required for a top-four finish, however, remains open to question. Pochettino was proud at his players\xe2\x80\x99 efforts at Anfield and the performances of Harry Kane and Erik Lamela certainly contributed to an open, entertaining game. But carelessness in midfield and brittleness at the back \xe2\x80\x93 with Hugo Lloris beaten far too easily for Lazar Markovic\xe2\x80\x99s opener \xe2\x80\x93 was a reminder that Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s work at White Hart Lane remains at the embryonic stage. Andy Hunter</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Liverpool 3-2 Tottenham Hotspur  \xe2\x80\xa2 Steven Gerrard could miss three weeks with hamstring injury  Fernandinho finding form after post-World Cup hangover <p>There were signs in Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s 4-1 cuffing of Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium \xe2\x80\x93 their first ever Premier League win at the ground \xe2\x80\x93 that Fernandinho is finding form again following the post-World Cup hangover suffered by the Brazilian. The midfielder turned schemer for the night, sliding several balls into team-mates \xe2\x80\x93 one that released Aleksandar Kolarov was particularly impressive \xe2\x80\x93 and though not a complete display from the \xc2\xa330m man, with Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 back for Newcastle United on Saturday week City\xe2\x80\x99s central axis could be stronger than it has been in recent weeks just as the business end of the campaign starts. Jamie Jackson</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Stoke City 1-4 Manchester City  \xe2\x80\xa2 Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero reassures City fans over injury fears  Foxes show some fight but need to find a finish <p>Nigel Pearson had endured the buildup from hell, what with \xe2\x80\x9cchoke-gate\xe2\x80\x9d and everything that followed it. The Leicester City manager also changed his formation for the visit to Arsenal, and his new-look back five featured two debutants \xe2\x80\x93 Robert Huth and Matthew Upson. They faced a wounded beast in Arsenal, who had lost to Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday, and it felt as though Pearson and his players were on a hiding to nothing, particularly when they went 2-0 down on 41 minutes. The response, amid the adversity, offered hope. Leicester had played well in the first half and they were even better in the second period. This squad clearly remains behind Pearson. Riyad Mahrez was dangerous; Andrej Kramaric scored his first goal for the club; they had Arsenal by the throat. But, as Pearson said afterwards, hard-luck stories count for nothing. Playing well and losing is not a good habit, and nor is creating a fistful of chances and not taking them. Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s finishing has been a problem all season. Unless they find cutting edge, they will go down. David Hytner</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Arsenal 2-1 Leicester City  \xe2\x80\xa2 Nigel Pearson: I rang James McArthur to clear the air over touchline tangle  Has Bruce done it again with N\xe2\x80\x99Doye? <p>Has Steve Bruce pulled off another January transfer window coup with the signing of the Senegal striker Dame N\xe2\x80\x99Doye? On the initial evidence provided at the KC Stadium the answer appears to be yes. Wind back the clock nine months and most Hull supporters were pointing to the new year acquisitions of Shane Long and Nikica Jelavic as the catalyst for pulling away from relegation trouble before it brewed. They scored eight times between them and by the time a place had been booked in the FA Cup final, so had their top-flight survival barring miracles. On Tuesday night, N\xe2\x80\x99Doye \xe2\x80\x93 who Bruce tried to lure to Sunderland from Copenhagen for a much heftier price tag four years ago only to be refused a work permit \xe2\x80\x93 returned the first dividend on the Yorkshire club\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa32.2m investment with a full debut goal against Aston Villa. It capped a fine first start in English football and helped lift Hull out of the bottom three. Richard Gibson</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Hull City 2-0 Aston Villa  \xe2\x80\xa2 Paul Lambert sacked by Aston Villa   \xe2\x80\xa2 Paul Lambert pays the price for his record of failure at Villa Park  Poyet urges patience among Sunderland faithful <p>A game at Sunderland is the equivalent of a week at a health spa for fellow Premier League strugglers. Gus Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s side have only won twice at home in the league all season and Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s 2-0 reverse on Wearside to Queens Park Rangers was entirely predictable. Particularly as QPR arrived lacking a single point on the road.</p> <p>Sunderland were abject but afterwards Poyet accused the fans of encouraging kick-and-rush football in the second half \xe2\x80\x93 when the team were 2-0 down and lucky not to be at least three behind \xe2\x80\x93 rather than the patient passing game he preaches. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that was football,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t call it football. It was a desperate team trying to be nice with fans. Everybody wanted the players to get the ball forward, to let it bounce and win corners. It was more important to the crowd to win corners than to pass the ball. The supporters would rather see the team running around than trying to pass the ball.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Quite apart from the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s wrong \xe2\x80\x93 Sunderland fans love good passing, which explains why players like Andy Reid and Steed Malbranque were so popular at the Stadium of Light and why the fans pray the manager will give Emanuele Giaccherini and Ricardo \xc3\x81lvarez greater starting opportunities now \xe2\x80\x93 they were two goals down in a vital fixture so attempting to win an odd corner didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem such a bad idea.</p> <p>Especially as their attempts to pass in the first half resulted in persistent surrenders of possession \xe2\x80\x93 with Jordi G\xc3\xb3mez probably a zero out of 10 in this respect \xe2\x80\x93 or moving the ball backwards or sideways.</p> <p>Most managers would have gone direct in such circumstances. Tellingly, the introduction of Peter Crouch and a late switch to 4-4-2 earned Mark Hughes\xe2\x80\x99s Stoke a point at Newcastle on Sunday \xe2\x80\x93 and Hughes generally likes his team to pass cleverly. But, no Gus, overall Sunderland fans do not want kick and rush. But they do want skilful, entertaining, progressive football \xe2\x80\x93 which means passing well but swiftly and, preferably, forwards. Louise Taylor</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Sunderland 0-2 QPR  \xe2\x80\xa2 QPR consider appointing Chris Ramsey until end of season  An abundance of prolific Englishmen <p>Brown Ideye, rightly, stole most of the headlines after West Bromwich Albion\xe2\x80\x99s 2-0 win against Swansea on Wednesday night but Saido Berahino also found the net and has now amassed an impressive 15 goals this season. The 21-year-old had gone four matches without scoring following a stop-start, celebrating-goals-not-celebrating goals under Tony Pulis but the performance against Swansea showed that he is back to something approaching his best as he also set up Ideye\xe2\x80\x99s goal.</p> <p>Berahino\xe2\x80\x99s goal contributed to a barely believable stat for the midweek round of Premier League games: 11 of the goals were scored by Englishmen. Who knew there were even that many English players in the league. The 11 goals were nearly half of the total amount scored over Tuesday and Wednesday and extremely encouraging for Roy Hodgson (although how often we will see a Chris Smalling brace is a moot point).</p> <p>As far as strikers were concerned it is difficult to remember the last time an English national coach had so much choice up front. Charlie Austin and Harry Kane are joint third in the Premier League goalscoring chart with 13 goals each, Berahino has 10 in the league with Danny Ings just a strike behind him. Add to that Daniel Sturridge, who has just returned from injury, and Hodgson has four young, prolific scorers to pick for the games against Lithuania and Italy in addition to Wayne Rooney, who, despite whatever Louis van Gaal thinks, remains a forward and not a wide-right midfielder. Marcus Christenson</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 West Bromwich Albion 2-0 Swansea  \xe2\x80\x98Crowd member\xe2\x80\x99 who threw coin at Coloccini should be banned     Fabricio Coloccini was hit by a coin at Selhurst Park. Photograph: Michael Zemanek/BPI/Rex    <p>John Carver is right. The crowd member (\xe2\x80\x9cCrystal Palace supporter\xe2\x80\x9d is too kind) who threw a coin at Fabricio Coloccini, narrowly missing his eye, should be identified by the club and banned from watching football. A criminal charge should also be brought. Football does not offer special privileges on behaviour and anybody doing anything similar in Thornton Heath high street would expect to be arrested.</p> <p>For all that, perhaps there is still a warning here about the enduring volatility of crowds. Even before it became apparent something had been thrown there was something a little uncomfortable about the way Papiss Ciss\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s goal was celebrated. That area of Palace fans is a small, distinct pocket in the corner. It is the section that always sings, waves its flags and offers the \xe2\x80\x9cfanatical\xe2\x80\x9d support may have noted this season, including Carver post-match. It seemed strange at the time that Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s players ran there and celebrated after the goal. The goal was scored on the opposite side. Their own fans were further back up that same side. Unfortunately they ended up in that corner, offering the bizarre sight of Palace\xe2\x80\x99s fans carrying on singing and dancing even as the opposition celebrated in front of them \xe2\x80\x93 and for quite a long time. It seemed at that point like a nice little oddity: Palace\xe2\x80\x99s ultras still singing on in adversity. Yet, you did keep wishing Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s players would move back to their half.</p> <p>There is no excuse whatsoever, no mitigation. Football is an entertainment, not an arena in which to abuse and attack people and players are free to stand or celebrate wherever they want. The great shame is that Palace\xe2\x80\x99s noisiest fans, who have been a wonderful spectacle this season with their flags and the relentless singing of that song, have now had their support marred by the actions of one person, a rare show of old style football passion marred by some old style football idiocy. Barney Ronay </p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Crystal Palace 1-1 Newcastle United             Mauricio Pochettino was full of praise for his Tottenham side in defeat to Liverpool.

West Ham did not concede on the night and the Finn is set to start the FA Cup game against West Brom on Saturday, showing the importance of having a good back-up keeper. Being a second-choice \xe2\x80\x93 not to mention third-choice \xe2\x80\x93 goalkeeper must often be a soul-destroying experience, preparing for games you are unlikely to ever take part in, but this season has showed that there will be opportunities. Brad Jones was called upon when Simon Mignolet suffered a dip of form and did well for Liverpool in the games he played while David Ospina has supplanted Wojciech Szczesny as the Arsenal No1. And at Stamford Bridge Petr Cech made some saves that could end up winning Chelsea the title if it goes to the wire. Some back-up keeper.
