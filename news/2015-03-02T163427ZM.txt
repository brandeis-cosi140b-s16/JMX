b'Mugging for the camera like a kid at an older sister\xe2\x80\x99s birthday party'


b'TOOTING HIS OWN HORN WITH CHAMPAGNE AND SELF-CONGRATULATION DRIPPING FROM HIS FACE <p>The time after team wins a cup is usually reserved for the players to celebrate. A time for them to dance around, possibly wearing a novelty jester hat in team colours, possibly the lid of the pot they\xe2\x80\x99ve just won atop their bonces. They will do a jig, socks around ankles, wave to those family members that have successfully pestered them for free tickets and generally soak up the glory of achievement. The manager will traditionally be a peripheral figure, hiding at the back of the group, eventually reluctantly and bashfully pushed in front of some photographers to hold the cup aloft. These days, they also might be thrown up in the air by their players in a weird cross between a university initiation ceremony and the birthday bumps. The key is that it should all be low-key. Quiet. Dignified. Traditionally, it not about them.</p> <p>Which brings us to Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho, who after Chelsea lifted the Milk Cup by default after Tottenham Hotspur very literally failed to turn up at Wembley, their place taken by eleven floating items of laundry, gave tradition one in the eye by looning it up in front of his players, mugging for the camera like a kid at an older sister\xe2\x80\x99s birthday party, upset and bemused as to why someone else was getting all the attention. And, like most of his ostentatious distraction techniques, it worked, with pictures adorning basically every newspaper back page of his most egotistical majesty lying, legs akimbo, in front of his players as they jigged in celebration, like some sort of Jacob\xe2\x80\x99s Creek-addled HR manager who\xe2\x80\x99d overdone it on a work night out.</p> <p>Still, Mourinho will no doubt tell you he deserves the limelight, and since Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s own Spurs-esque disappearing act at Liverpool basically donated the title to Chelsea, meaning they are quite possibly the only team in recent history to win two major trophies in one day. City seem to be defending their title like Baldrick and George advancing very slowly across no-man\xe2\x80\x99s land, waving a stick in response to German machine-gun fire. It\xe2\x80\x99s been about as effective as putting sugar paper over the windows of a house when the hurricane warnings come in.</p> <p>Still, Jos\xc3\xa9 isn\xe2\x80\x99t letting that harsh his buzz at all. \xe2\x80\x9cMy career had gone in a different direction, with two seasons without a trophy, and it looked like I was 20 years without a trophy, even to myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he own-horn-tooted, champagne and self-congratulation still dripping from his face. \xe2\x80\x9cBut to have that feeling that two years is a long time, that\xe2\x80\x99s a good problem. For me it\xe2\x80\x99s important to feel I\xe2\x80\x99m still a kid, even at 52 years of age.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ah. There we go. There\xe2\x80\x99s the reason for Jos\xc3\xa9 bouncing around like he\xe2\x80\x99s eaten five bags of Haribo, waving his arms in the air shouting \xe2\x80\x9cME! ME! ME! IT\xe2\x80\x99S ALL ABOUT ME! ME! ME!\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s really a six-year-old boy, suddenly giving a crystal clear explanation for the absurd tantrums, poking Tito Vilanova in the eye (seriously \xe2\x80\x93 who outside a school playground pokes someone in the eye?), the bullying of the football world\xe2\x80\x99s speccy and nerdy kids (referees) and the absolute obsession with ensuring everyone\xe2\x80\x99s looking at him, him, him. Presumably, the next time there\xe2\x80\x99s a whiff of a suggestion that some cameras might not be pointing in his direction, he\xe2\x80\x99ll take off all his clothes and run around the garden, before being sent to bed on the grounds that he\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98over-tired\xe2\x80\x99. Bad Jos\xc3\xa9.

It\xe2\x80\x99s a decision that I don\xe2\x80\x99t think is necessarily the wrong decision, but the bigger factor is it disappoints me that he\xe2\x80\x99s lost that dream\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Torquay boss Chris Hargreaves bemoans his goalkeeper Jordan Seabright\xe2\x80\x99s decision to quit football in favour of becoming a car salesman and perhaps overplays the position of Torquay goalkeeper. </p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe. Robbie Savage\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer earning his fee for the defence that he needs his license in order to escape the abuse he may (will) receive from the public (Friday\xe2\x80\x99s letters): if this is anything to go by anyone would think that he was purposely trying to lose his license. Perhaps a better defence would have been that poor Robbie doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the money for a taxi \xe2\x80\x93 oh\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ben Marlow.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cManchester City fans will be outraged at your smug claim that \xe2\x80\x98Barcelona are set to say adi\xc3\xb3s\xe2\x80\x99 to their team.
