b'Louis van Gaal: Manchester United do not have a 20-goal striker'


b'<p>Louis van Gaal admits that, despite having a \xc2\xa3100m frontline, Manchester United do not have a striker who can score 20 goals this season. The manager puts the inability of Radamel Falcao or Robin van Persie to do so down to bad luck.</p> <p>Falcao, whose total cost if a permanent deal is done with Monaco would be \xc2\xa350m, has four goals; Van Persie, signed for \xc2\xa324m, has 10 goals; Wayne Rooney (\xc2\xa326m), nine goals; and James Wilson, Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s homegrown fourth forward, two.</p> <p>United sit fourth, 13 points behind the leaders, Chelsea, and eight adrift of Manchester City. Asked if the difference between United and the two title favourites is that they boast superior strikers, the manager said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is true because I cannot deny it \xe2\x80\x93 Robin van Persie cannot deny it, Falcao cannot deny it and Rooney is not playing there much any more. We cannot deny that, at this moment, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a striker who scores 20 goals in the season.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis does not tell [us] anything about next year. They could be having an unlucky year and I have to decide, with my staff, if it is [this] or other aspects.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Part of Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s footballing philosophy is to retrain players to use their brains rather than instinct. \xc3\x81ngel Di Mar\xc3\xada, the British record \xc2\xa359.7m signing, has struggled to find regular form this term and the manager acknowledged that his demands are difficult for the Argentinian and all his players. \xe2\x80\x9cI think not only Di Mar\xc3\xada, I think all the players,\xe2\x80\x9d the manager added. \xe2\x80\x9cMy belief, and the belief of the board, is when you do things with your conscience [consciously] then it shall be better. But at the end every player has to do each task with intuition, because that is the process. He needs to go through that process and at the end he shall be much better. I know as a manager that he is a very creative player and you can see this from the statistics.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe needs that space and I give that space, but he needs to do also things with his brain and that is a learning process, not only with Di Mar\xc3\xada but with all the players. It is not always the fault of the manager, when a player is not performing well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Asked why elite players need to be retrained, Van Gaal said: \xe2\x80\x9cBecause every team has its own philosophy and then you have to play like that philosophy and that is why a lot of players are not fitting in that philosophy which is why some players are better with one club but not at another. There are a lot of examples of that to give. When you buy players you need to give them time to adapt to the culture of England, to the rhythm of the Premier League, because that is a big difference to somewhere like Spain.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Gaal refused to say whether his methods will make Di Mar\xc3\xada a better or poorer player. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you always asking the manager and not the player? You have to ask the player that. You have never an interview with the player?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>For Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Old Trafford on Saturday Michael Carrick is available again after injury, though Van Persie\xe2\x80\x99s ankle injury will keep him out for at least two weeks. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is injured, the only injured player that I have. So, we change Carrick for Van Persie. He has an ankle problem so I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is heavy, but an ankle problem takes a long time. It\xe2\x80\x99s not one or two weeks, but we will have to wait and see,\xe2\x80\x9d the Dutchman said.</p> <p>This could allow Falcao to be restored to the XI having not started in the 2-1 loss to Swansea City. \xe2\x80\x9cThe possibility is higher of course because when a striker is away another has to play,\xe2\x80\x9d said Van Gaal.</p>'
