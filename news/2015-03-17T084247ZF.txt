b'Football transfer rumours: Luciano Vietto to Liverpool?'


b'<p>Everyone is saying it and they\xe2\x80\x99re right: this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s Liverpool-Manchester United clash is big. Actually, it is massive. It is impossible to exaggerate just how massive it is. It is so massive that if for some reason it had to be postponed, the last Sumatran tigers would die and the moon would explode.</p> <p>OK, so it is possible to exaggerate just how massive this match is, but look, it\xe2\x80\x99s still big and it could have serious ramifications for the losers. The defeated side will, for instance, lose ground in the battle for the top four, be forced to listen to triumphalist singing from rivals who get right up their noses, and run the risk of missing out on the Champions League and, therefore, summer transfer targets.</p> <p>If Manchester United fail to make the Champions League, will they have any chance of attracting Paul Pogba? Juventus claim that United have confided that they would be prepared to pay up to \xc2\xa355m for the player (that would be a strange negotiation strategy if true, just as saying \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m warning you, if you hit me five times, I\xe2\x80\x99ll hit you back\xe2\x80\x9d is a surefire way of getting hit at least four times) but whatever chance they have of luring the player back would surely evaporate if they only had the Europa League to offer by way of midweek fun. Especially as Chelsea are also on the Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s trail.</p> <p>United also want to impress the Brazilian attacking midfielder Roberto Firmino, who is currently tearing up the Bundesliga with Hoffenheim. And they\xe2\x80\x99re also eyeing up Paulo Dybala, a 21-year-old Argentinian striker who has been described as \xe2\x80\x9cthe new Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero\xe2\x80\x9d by some observers and as \xe2\x80\x9cour property for whom you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to pay tens of millions of pounds\xe2\x80\x9d by everyone at Palermo. Liverpool also want the player so you could say that this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s match is a fight for the boy\xe2\x80\x99s affections. Perhaps Jeremy Kyle should referee?</p> <p>Liverpool, mind you, have an alternative in mind, namely Villarreal\xe2\x80\x99s Luciano Vietto, another 21-year-old Argentinian striker, who, now that you mention it, has probably also been described as \xe2\x80\x9cthe new Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Alan Pardew wants to bolster Crystal Palace\xe2\x80\x99s attack by making Lo\xc3\xafc Remy the new Glenn Murray.</p> <p>Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s old club hope they can impress Marseille\xe2\x80\x99s Andre Ayew with a big salary and long holidays, which usually begin around early February for Newcastle players.</p> <p>Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid want to persuade Chelsea to give them back Filipe Lu\xc3\xads and pretend that transfer never happen.</p> <p>Finally, David Moyes could be on his way back to Old Trafford \xe2\x80\x93 when West Ham play there next season, as the Londoners are considering hiring the Scot to replace Sam Allardyce.</p>'
