b'1) Why is Rooney playing as a holding midfielder?  <p> Related: Transfer deadline day \xe2\x80\x93 live! | Michael Butler </p>   <p>Wayne Rooney ended Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s 3-1 win over Leicester City as a holding midfielder alongside Daley Blind. He began the game as a floating schemer in the Paul Scholes mould. The idea was that Rooney would ignite play, seeing the quick and long pass. The problem was his radar was often awry when attempting the raking ball designed to open Leicester up. While the 29-year-old has the vision to operate in the role, on afternoons such as Saturday when it does not happen for him, it seems a waste that he is not operating further upfield as the No10 or in attack. There, as his long career shows, Rooney wreaks havoc. Instead, in a sizeable slight against the \xc2\xa329m Ander Herrera, Louis van Gaal opted for Rooney while the Spaniard remained an unused replacement. Seeing Rooney in front of the defence at the end compounded the general oddity of his manager\xe2\x80\x99s deployment of him. Jamie Jackson</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s salary as United ambassador is 14 times that of prime minister\xe2\x80\xa2 Fletcher\xe2\x80\x99s move to West Ham from Manchester United is off\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Manchester United 3-1 Leicester</p>               2) Sturridge shone but Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s defence was key against West Ham <p>Daniel Sturridge naturally claimed the headlines with his comeback goal for Liverpool against West Ham United on Saturday but other, notable aspects of the home performance could not be ignored. Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s defending against the obvious aerial and set-piece threat of Sam Allardyce\xe2\x80\x99s team impressed in particular. It took Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 side 22 matches from the start of this season to register four clean sheets. They have kept the same total in their past six games, with Eden Hazard\xe2\x80\x99s penalty and Branislav Ivanovic\xe2\x80\x99s header from a free-kick for Chelsea in the Capital One Cup semi-final the only goals conceded in that sequence.</p>   <div data-embed-type="table" class="player-card player-card--football" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <div class="player-card__image-container">  </div> <div class="player-card__player"> <div class="player-card__position" itemprop="jobTitle">Defender</div> <div class="player-card__name" itemprop="name">Mamadou Sakho</div> </div> <dl class="player-card__stats"> <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Appearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">10</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots blocked</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">2</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Clearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">65</dd> </dl> </div>   <p>Simon Mignolet\xe2\x80\x99s form has improved significantly while Mamadou Sakho has benefited from Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to hold grudges against errant or struggling players. The France international was disciplined for walking out of Anfield having been omitted from Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s squad for the Merseyside derby in September. He now approaches the return meeting with Everton this Saturday in commanding form. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to be honest with players and sometimes the modern player cannot deal with that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rodgers. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe Sakho was frustrated with himself at times but he\xe2\x80\x99s got a really strong mentality. That\xe2\x80\x99s what you need, a team that\xe2\x80\x99s hard to beat with mental toughness, and he\xe2\x80\x99s a tough boy.\xe2\x80\x9d Andy Hunter </p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Rodgers praises Daniel Sturridge after Liverpool comeback\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Liverpool 2-0 West Ham</p>  3) Fan loses perspective on Lampard\xe2\x80\x99s return  <p> Related: Harry Kane signs new five-and-a-half year contract with Tottenham </p>   <p>On returning to Chelsea Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Frank Lampard received a mixed reception, as might have been expected, on his return to Stamford Bridge, but not everyone retained a sense of perspective for a fixture that engenders much frenzied hype. So hats off to the grown adult human that took in this banner, denouncing Lampard as \xe2\x80\x9ca traitor\xe2\x80\x9d to Chelsea and \xe2\x80\x9cnot a legend\xe2\x80\x9d. Some people really do have too much time on their hands. Tom Davies</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Diego Costa: I\xe2\x80\x99m no angel but didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to be banned\xe2\x80\xa2 Mourinho facing Premier League punishment after press blackout\xe2\x80\xa2 Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s squad leaves doubts but City could learn from their hard noses\xe2\x80\xa2 Ag\xc3\xbcero provides the guile to keep Manchester City in title chase \xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Chelsea 1-1 Manchester City </p>               4) Is Villa\xe2\x80\x99s plight the sorriest of any club in England? <p>Taking into account heritage, fanbase and potential is there a sadder club in England right now than Aston Villa? Supporters of Leeds United and a few other teams may raise their hands but it is hard currently to look beyond the Midlands\xe2\x80\x99 struggling giant. Defeat by Arsenal on Sunday made it eight league games without victory for Paul Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s men and, for the first time in their history, six without scoring. No points and no goals, God bless those Villa fans who turned up at the Emirates on a bitterly cold afternoon.</p> <p>The visitors did not actually play that badly and things could have been different had Andreas Weimann or Christian Benteke taken the more than decent chances that came their way either side of half-time. Lambert described them as \xe2\x80\x9cbig moments\xe2\x80\x9d and there was no hiding his frustration at his team\xe2\x80\x99s current plight. In all probability Villa will score enough goals and secure enough points to avoid relegation but come the summer this routine of stinking the place out yet surviving by the skin of their teeth has to end. It has gone on far too long for a club that not so long ago were competing for a Champions League place and remain one of only six British clubs to have won the European Cup.</p> <p>That means Randy Lerner finally selling the club or, if he has no option but to stick around, once again investing strongly in playing resources. It may also mean Lambert, despite his obvious hunger to succeed, moving on. It has been almost three seasons since he arrived and, if anything, things are getting worse. Fresh change may well require a fresh man in the dugout. Sachin Nakrani</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Arsenal 5-0 Aston Villa\xe2\x80\xa2 Villa\xe2\x80\x99s defensive naivety plays into Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s hands</p>  5) Shelvey\xe2\x80\x99s shining example \xe2\x80\x93 to himself <p>Southampton supporters are usually delighted with the high-calibre performances that they see from central midfielders at St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s but they got little pleasure from watching Jonjo Shelvey thrive in the absence of Morgan Schneiderlin and Victor Wanyama on Sunday. Garry Monk, by contrast, was thrilled to see Shelvey put the crowning finish to an accomplished, uncharacteristically defensive away performance that offered more proof of the promise of this novice manager. Given Shelvey\xe2\x80\x99s previous tendency to lose focus and lapse into indiscipline, Monk was wise to lace his praise of the player with a warning not to fritter away his potential. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Jonjo\xe2\x80\x99s motivation and worth ethic are high, the quality is there to see,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monk. \xe2\x80\x9cI try to push it out of him every day. I can push him but he has to push himself. Things like that goal should be a reminder of what can be achieved if you work hard. He\xe2\x80\x99s still only young and he has to take that into the rest of his career.\xe2\x80\x9d Paul Doyle</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Southampton 0-1 Swansea City\xe2\x80\xa2 Swansea sign Jack Cork from Southampton</p>  6) Playing Lescott at left-back will not help either player or club  <p> Related: Nottingham Forest appoint Dougie Freedman after sacking Stuart Pearce </p>      Joleon Lescott handles the ball from a cross from Tottenham Hotspur\xe2\x80\x99s Kyle Walker leading to a penalty. Photograph: BEN STANSALL/AFP/Getty Images    <p>After going 266 minutes without conceding a Premier League goal, West Bromwich Albion collapsed in the opening quarter of an hour of Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s first defeat under Tony Pulis as Tottenham Hotspur opened them up with ease. Even when they did battle back into the contest, they made it 3-0 with a penalty conceded after Joleon Lescott\xe2\x80\x99s handball.</p> <p>Pulis likes to build from the back so he will not be satisfied by his team\xe2\x80\x99s defending. The decision to play Lescott at left-back can be rationalised by the manager\xe2\x80\x99s desire to play a left-footer on that side whom he can trust defensively. With Andre Wisdom at right-back, it meant all four members of the defence have played centre-back for some or all of their careers. It also means West Brom can defend aerial balls to the back post better.</p> <p>But it does not suit Lescott. \xe2\x80\x9cThe manager has obviously asked me to do a job and at the [moment] I can do that but I see myself as centre-half,\xe2\x80\x9d the former Manchester City man said. \xe2\x80\x9cI came here to play centre-half. I feel I have been doing well doing that. That is what is best for the team but I am not a left-back\xe2\x80\x9d. And while he is not the type to throw his toys out the pram, the selection does seem counter-productive.</p> <p>Lescott does not offer much going forward down the left, he is much happier playing simple short passes into central midfield and he has been in top form in central defence, playing with the composure and decisiveness that made him an England squad regular. Perhaps Pulis wants to make his point that he needs a more accomplished left-back but he would do well to keep his best pros onside.

While it is a relatively shallow history, it is a modern one, and a recurrence will inevitably result in a second relegation. Under three different managers Hull have tailed off dramatically in the final 15 matches to claim a combined points tally of 32 (an average of 0.7 points a game). Last season produced comfortably their best haul when a collection of 14 saw them finish in 16th place. However, they were in the relative comfort of 13th place when that sequence began, not in the relegation zone as they are now. Richard Gibson</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Hull City 0-3 Newcastle\xe2\x80\xa2 Latest tables across Europe</p>  8) Goal-line technology is being embraced by all, if a little reluctantly   <p> Related: Wilfried Zaha rejoins Crystal Palace on permanent deal from Manchester United </p>   <p>Alan Pardew joked about the genius behind goal-line technology needing \xe2\x80\x9ca kick up the bum\xe2\x80\x9d, bemoaning the fact all this new-found accuracy had taken an element of fun out of the game, but there is no denying football is benefiting from Hawk-Eye\xe2\x80\x99s intervention. Dwight Gayle\xe2\x80\x99s clever flick on Damien Delaney\xe2\x80\x99s downward header was perilously close to crossing the line at Selhurst Park, Phil Jagielka hacking it clear from under the crossbar, but the cameras revealed it was marginally short of the mark. Crystal Palace\xe2\x80\x99s players, and a few Evertonians judging by the flashes of anxiety, had initially been convinced an equaliser had been scored.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was in from the reactions but you want the right result,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pardew. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it had been late in the game I think it would\xe2\x80\x99ve hurt even more. But it\xe2\x80\x99s there now and it works. At least it proved it works now.\xe2\x80\x9d There will be occasions when it works in Palace\xe2\x80\x99s favour, but there is already an acceptance that this is an accurate system that leaves little room for argument. The technology works well.

Harry Redknapp, the QPR manager, gives direction during the Premier League match against Stoke. Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images    <p>Harry Redknapp is regarded as Mr Transfer Deadline Day but, despite interest in Emmanuel Adebayor, he is predicting an uneventful final day of the window today. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are looking but don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99re close to doing anything really,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been looking and looking but it\xe2\x80\x99s so difficult, who\xe2\x80\x99s going to let good players go? We just need another striker really, someone who might come and score goals. Good frontmen are not easy to find.\xe2\x80\x9d Ian Baker</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Stoke City 3-1 QPR\xe2\x80\xa2 QPR ground considered for Super League fixtures</p>  10) Do Sunderland have the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s most loyal supporters? <p>A crowd in excess of 44,000 made their way to the Stadium of Light on an icy late January day big on wind chill factor to watch Sunderland \xe2\x80\x93 aka the doziest of sleeping giants \xe2\x80\x93 beat Burnley 2-0 in a classic relegation six-pointer. The remarkable thing is that this was only the second time this season Gus Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s side have won a Premier League game at home \xe2\x80\x93 and it is not even as if the football has been entertaining. Only last week Poyet acknowledged that his players had been \xe2\x80\x9crubbish to watch\xe2\x80\x9d just lately and admitted even he \xe2\x80\x9cwould struggle to score in this team\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>At other clubs attendances would surely have dwindled to embarrassing levels months ago but the loyalty of Sunderland fans is something else. The atmosphere they created was described as \xe2\x80\x9celectric\xe2\x80\x9d by Jermain Defoe on Saturday \xe2\x80\x93 just imagine what it might be like if the team was any good.</p> <p>Louise Taylor</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Sunderland 2-0 Burnley\xe2\x80\xa2 Poyet says Cattermole may require knee surgery</p>       Pos Team P GD Pts      1 Chelsea 23 32 53    2 Man City 23 23 48    3 Man Utd 23 17 43    4 Southampton 23 20 42    5 Arsenal 23 19 42    6 Tottenham Hotspur 23 5 40    7 Liverpool 23 6 38    8 West Ham 23 8 36    9 Swansea 23 -3 33    10 Stoke 23 -2 32    11 Newcastle 23 -6 30    12 Everton 23 -3 26    13 Crystal Palace 23 -9 23    14 Sunderland 23 -12 23    15 West Brom 23 -12 22    16 Aston Villa 23 -19 22    17 Burnley 23 -17 20    18 Hull 23 -13 19    19 QPR 23 -18 19    20 Leicester 23 -16 17     '
