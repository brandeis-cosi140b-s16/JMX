b'West Brom 2-2 Manchester United: five talking points | Alan Smith'


b'United remain miles off level required for tilt at the title <p>Victory here would have catapulted United into the title reckoning, according to Louis van Gaal. This flaccid performance not only made even the briefest mention of finishing top look hugely premature but a look at the fixture list \xe2\x80\x93 Chelsea and Manchester City are up next \xe2\x80\x93 means such talk should not be uttered for a long time to come. If their defensive frailties are easily highlighted by perceived lesser players then the likes of Diego Costa and Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero must relish the thought of the chances which could fall their way.</p> Irvine turning The Hawthorns into a minor fortress <p>Manchester United have always enjoyed going to The Hawthorns but West Bromwich Albion have become a far more imposing proposition in front of their own fans this season under Alan Irvine. They drew nine times at home in the previous Premier League campaign but there was something different about last night. This was an assured performance by Albion, one which exuded confidence. The 30-year wait for a victory over United at The Hawthorns goes on but positives could be taken despite Daley Blind\xe2\x80\x99s late equaliser.</p> Fellaini displays his strengths to galvanise initial fightback <p>It would be wrong to proclaim this as the night Marouane Fellaini finally arrived for United, but it was unquestionably his most positive performance for the club. In the first half Van Gaal engaged in a frank exchange with the Belgian on the bench, like a headteacher telling off a misbehaving pupil. Whatever was said had the desired effect on him initially. For a side shorn of physicality, Fellaini\xe2\x80\x99s 1.94m frame was a welcome tonic.</p> Berahino brilliant but Albion\xe2\x80\x99s star man was Sess\xc3\xa8gnon <p>Praise has justifiably been heaped on Saido Berahino this season \xe2\x80\x93 and if he keeps performing to this standard it will only be a matter of time before he departs to one of the big hitters. However, it is also time for St\xc3\xa9phane Sess\xc3\xa8gnon\xe2\x80\x99s growing influence to be flagged up. The delightful finish for the opening goal aside, his subtle link-up play was a delight to watch. All Sess\xc3\xa8gnon needs is a touch more consistency and Albion should enjoy a season comfortably ensconced in mid-table, away from any threat of a relegation fight.</p> Questions raised over Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s flaky positioning sense <p>Luke Shaw may forever be judged by his \xc2\xa327m price tag but he will have done himself no favours with a performance which, at times, bordered on awful. Not only was he sold softly by Graham Dorrans on the halfway line for Sess\xc3\xa8gnon\xe2\x80\x99s goal, he was also continuously caught out of position, allowing both Albion players in behind too often. \xc3\x81ngel di Mar\xc3\xada, for all his attacking ability, will never provide much protection but Shaw often got the basics wrong. His wayward crossing also posed further questions.</p>'
