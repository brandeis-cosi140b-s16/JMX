b'<p>JUST WHEN I THOUGHT I WAS OUT \xe2\x80\xa6 THEY PULL ME BACK IN</p> <p>Considering he once fought off a pack of wild dogs while hiking in the Carpathian mountains, armed only with a walking pole, it was no great surprise that Nigel Pearson opted to take on the comparatively less scary Crystal Palace midfielder James McArthur with his bare hands. In a weird Saturday afternoon set-to following an accidental touchline collision between the pair, the apparent gaiety of the occasion appeared to switch from \xe2\x80\x9camusing ribaldry\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cdownright sinister and menacing\xe2\x80\x9d in the time it takes a scary, bullet-headed man who can tame a pack of slavering hounds with a stick to violently throttle somebody who\xe2\x80\x99s just accidentally bumped into him for just a teeny, weeny bit longer than seemed appropriate. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said something,\xe2\x80\x9d snarled Pearson, although what it was exactly that McArthur is supposed to have said remains unclear. The Fiver presumes it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the pair\xe2\x80\x99s prearranged safeword.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI got a bit scared, to be honest,\xe2\x80\x9d said McArthur. \xe2\x80\x9cThese things happen and you see it quite a lot with managers and players throughout the game, so I\xe2\x80\x99m not bothered by it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve collided into him and he said it was only a joke, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll take it in that manner and we move on.\xe2\x80\x9d Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbanter\xe2\x80\x9d defence was far from convincing and we can only speculate whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99d have said the same thing if McArthur had been subjected to a different sort of bullying: a bog-wash in one of the dressing room toilets, before being left hanging forlornly from a peg by the waistband of his club grundies.</p> <p>In the wake of this bizarre contretemps, Pearson seemed anything but apologetic and on Sunday night it looked as if he\xe2\x80\x99d been sacked from a job he once said \xe2\x80\x9cmotivates me but it also brings out the worst in me\xe2\x80\x9d. Forced to release a statement confirming that Pearson would still be in charge for Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s defeat at Arsenal after widespread reports that he would not, the club shoved their manager into a hail of bullets at an unsurprisingly well-attended pre-match press briefing on Monday afternoon, where he was only too happy to clarify matters.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve just said I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to talk about it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said by way of response to the man from Sky Sports with the microphone, sweaty palms and nervous look on his face. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to find another way of asking the same question? There are reasons I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it. I\xe2\x80\x99m prepared now to look forward to the next game. I can\xe2\x80\x99t see too much mileage in me discussing what happened yesterday. If I\xe2\x80\x99ve got things to say, I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it in the appropriate way to the appropriate people. That\xe2\x80\x99s how I am moving forward.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>So that\xe2\x80\x99s cleared all that up, although Proud Son of Leicester, Gary Lineker, has since suggested that Pearson \xe2\x80\x9cwas sacked by one of the owner\xe2\x80\x99s family and reinstated by another\xe2\x80\x9d. Of his and McArthur\xe2\x80\x99s impromptu recreation of the hearthrug wrestling scene from Women In Love, Pearson was equally forthcoming. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not helpful when the three fountains of knowledge on Match of the Day make a mountain out of a molehill,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, blaming the panellists on a football highlights show for exaggerating his weird behaviour. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d best be careful in future, the fella can look after himself,\xe2\x80\x9d tweeted the show\xe2\x80\x99s host, Lineker, by way of cheeky response to Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s menacing and undisputed Saturday assurance that he can handle himself. Whether or not he can drag bottom-placed Leicester up the table with the same enthusiasm with which he attempted to drag McArthur\xe2\x80\x99s Adam\xe2\x80\x99s apple from his neck on Saturday remains to be seen.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cForest Green Rovers accept the photos of the incident do not make good viewing for a club that prides itself on being family-friendly and welcoming to away fans\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 of course, nothing says \xe2\x80\x98family-friendly\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98welcoming to away fans\xe2\x80\x99 like six stewards carting off Grimsby Town fan Bryan Winship in a headlock for the crime of \xe2\x80\x9cplaying with a large inflatable football\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> RANT OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s one person who has just kicked off in the changing rooms today. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even on the bench and as far as I am concerned he won\xe2\x80\x99t play for Telford again. He is paid to do a job and he was asked to go on to that pitch today and do some running and he said \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99 so, as far as I am concerned, he is finished at this club. I am not going to mess around. He has got to learn. He\xe2\x80\x99s a young lad. He thinks he is better than he is. His dad rings me every other day saying how good he is and I have had enough. My patience has run out because I have left people out today and he\xe2\x80\x99s travelled. And he is treating this club like it is nothing and he is going to learn the hard way, I am afraid\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Telford manager Steve Kittrick locates his top then blows it, with midfielder Sean Cooke the collateral damage.</p> POSSIBLY THE LAST CALL FOR MORE OF YOUR MUNDANE ENCOUNTERS WITH FAMOUS PEOPLE \xe2\x80\xa6 <p>\xe2\x80\x9cJuan Mata parked on the road outside my office last week. There\xe2\x80\x99s no requirement to pay and display there, but he jolly well found a machine and did it anyway. When he reads this, he\xe2\x80\x99s gonna feel sick about that 50p he wasted\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ryan Macdonald.</p>      <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMany years ago, back when kids bought their music in vinyl form (ask your parents), I worked for the \xe2\x80\x98Mad about music? See a specialist!\xe2\x80\x99 chain of record shops, Our Price, in their Uxbridge store. One particular day the store manager was crouched on the shop floor, moving about some stock in the Top 40 albums display, when a customer stood over him to take a CD case off a shelf. However, in doing so he somehow managed to lose his grip on the pile of CDs he already had in his hands. He made a failed, and, from my vantage point loitering behind the counter, quite comical attempt to grab at them, but only succeeded in sending them all tumbling on to my colleague\xe2\x80\x99s head. My bruised workmate stood up, with the intention of remonstrating with the customer (remember that this was a record shop, customer service was never one of our highest priorities), but for the Chelsea-supporting store manager there was to be disappointment, and a resigned acceptance of his club\xe2\x80\x99s bad fortune, when he found that the clumsy customer was none other than the infamous slippery-handed condiment dropper Dave Beasant\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Tim Grey.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve patiently waited all week for my brother to write in about his mundane encounter with a footballer, but since he has a life and success and a new baby and things, he mustn\xe2\x80\x99t read The Fiver, so I\xe2\x80\x99ll relay it for him. Flying out to Spain for a golfing holiday a couple of years back, he and his golfing buddies bumped into Kenny Dalglish at the airport. They asked him for a picture, to which he replied \xe2\x80\x98eff off lads\xe2\x80\x99. A couple of days later they were on the 11th hole, which began at the top of a hill. After all taking their shots they began to walk down the hill, only to see two old fellas pushing a broken-down golf buggy up the hill, sweating profusely in the Spanish sunshine. As the two guys approached, they realised one of them was good old King Kenny, who pleaded with these strapping young lads to help him. Their response matched his in the airport, mixed in with howls of laughter, as Kenny glumly continued to push his buggy up the hill with his pal\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Stephen Yoxall.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWith much reluctance, may I be permitted to join the 1,056 other people to demand the \xe2\x80\x98mundane meetings\xe2\x80\x99 slot focus less on c****et and more on Association football? I suggest willow and leather deviants use the popular magazine Take a Break to highlight their glamorous lives. It\xe2\x80\x99s equally as funny as The Fiver and they may even win \xc2\xa350 if published\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Jonathan Dobson (and no others).</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother was in a London train station on Saturday when a train load of Crystal Palace fans arrived in back from Leicester. Also in the station were a bunch of Nottingham Forest fans heading home from Brighton. Some of the worse elements of both sets of fans then did some shouting and punching of each other. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to put logic to football fans fighting but, given Forest had just beaten a team Palace fans hate, and Palace had just beaten a team Forest fans hate, it made me wonder if these were the most idiotic people attending any football match this weekend?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Phil Pierce.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: Half Man Half Biscuit football-related tales (Friday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters).
