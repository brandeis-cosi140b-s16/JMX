b'Fabio Capello hits out at FA and calls for John Terry\xe2\x80\x99s England return'


b'<p>Fabio Capello has reopened old wounds with the Football Association by claiming that John Terry should still be playing for England. The FA\xe2\x80\x99s decision to sack Terry as captain of the national team \xe2\x80\x93 following allegations of racist abuse \xe2\x80\x93 clearly still rankles with the former England manager, who resigned following the decision.</p> <p>Asked on Wednesday if Terry should play for England again, Capello said: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is one of the best. They [England] haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a lot of defenders but they sometimes have problems. It\xe2\x80\x99s better to have a player like John Terry than not have him. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he has the chances to play with the national team any more.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey [the FA] decided he could not play with the national team and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand because he was not guilty,\xe2\x80\x9d Capello said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen it happened I said to the president [then FA chairman David Bernstein], \xe2\x80\x98You decided he\xe2\x80\x99s guilty? No, he\xe2\x80\x99s not guilty\xe2\x80\x99. \xe2\x80\x9cI fought for this and they said, \xe2\x80\x98No, you can\xe2\x80\x99t decide about the player, you need to wait for the court decision and everything\xe2\x80\x99. I said, \xe2\x80\x98Why have you decided before I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked you?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Capello, who is now managing Russia, was happy to praise some members of the England squad who started their international careers under his tutelage. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw some young players that played with me are improving,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at the Laureus world sports awards in Shanghai. \xe2\x80\x9cChris Smalling is playing, Phil Jones. I\xe2\x80\x99m happy because a lot of players I put in the national team are playing now and well. Ashley Young is also playing really well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>At the time of Capello\xe2\x80\x99s resignation, Terry was awaiting a court verdict on charges he had racially abused Anton Ferdinand in a game between Queens Park Rangers and Chelsea on 23 October 2011. Ferdinand had alleged that Terry called him a \xe2\x80\x9cfucking black cunt\xe2\x80\x9d, charges that Terry has always denied. The Chelsea captain was found not guilty of a racially aggravated public order offence on 13 July\xc2\xa02012.</p> <p>However, by that point, he had already been stripped of the England captaincy. He was later found guilty by the FA of \xe2\x80\x9cusing abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour towards Ferdinand and which included a reference to colour and/or race contrary to FA Rule E3[2]\xe2\x80\x9d, for which he was fined \xc2\xa3220,000 and banned for four matches.</p> <p>Terry accepted the charge and issued an apology for \xe2\x80\x9cthe language used in the game ... [that was] not acceptable on the football field or indeed in any walk of life.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
