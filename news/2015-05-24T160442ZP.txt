b'<p>So this, then, is indeed goodbye. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you for more Premier League clockwatches in August. We won\xe2\x80\x99t be seeing Hull, Sam Allardyce, Didier Drogba, Frank Lampard, or even Steven Gerrard until his return on loan in January. It\xe2\x80\x99s been rather fun and also quite funny \xe2\x80\x93 Liverpool seeing Gerrard off as only this Liverpool could; Didier getting his chairlift, Gutierrez\xe2\x80\x99s magic moment. We\xe2\x80\x99ll do it all again next season. Thanks for your excellent emails and tweets, and of course for reading. Bye for now!</p>     Steven Gerrard of Liverpool takes his captains armband off for the last time. Photograph: John Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images  '
