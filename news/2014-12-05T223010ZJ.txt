b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has claimed Newcastle United raise their game specifically for contests against Chelsea and, as with other Premier League sides, treat other opponents \xe2\x80\x9clike they\xe2\x80\x99re playing friendlies\xe2\x80\x9d as the Portuguese prepares for an awkward occasion at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park.</p> <p>The league leaders travel to the north-east for Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s lunchtime kick-off unbeaten this season and hoping to set a club record by extending their undefeated run to 24 games, though Mourinho is braced for a stern test. He has never won a league game on Tyneside \xe2\x80\x93 his only two victories in seven visits were reserved for the League Cup \xe2\x80\x93 and will be without the previously ever-present Nemanja Matic, who is serving a one-match suspension.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere are a few stadiums in this country where clearly, when they see the Chelsea shirts, they play the game of their lives,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen they play against other teams they look like they\xe2\x80\x99re playing friendlies. Maybe this is because Chelsea, in the last decade, became a strong team that everybody wants to beat.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Newcastle have not won a league game against the current top seven so far this season but did beat Liverpool at home and triumphed at Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City, in the League Cup. Asked whether that merely suggested Alan Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s team were guilty of nothing more than inconsistency, Mourinho said: \xe2\x80\x9cNot against us. It\xe2\x80\x99s a compliment. It makes us feel how big we are. It\xe2\x80\x99s a normal challenge: a difficult opponent and stadium, and one of the teams we really feel [consider] Chelsea to be special for them because they don\xe2\x80\x99t play every game the same way.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not only them. There are other clubs who have different ways of playing. That is something that, with Chelsea, I try not to do. With my players, I try to make them have always the same focus, ambition and commitment whoever they play against. But clearly there are some opponents in the Premier League for whom Chelsea are special, so we know this is going to be a tough match.\xe2\x80\x9d Asked which other rival clubs raised their game just for collisions with his team, the manager said: \xe2\x80\x9cWatch matches on television and make your own analysis. Or disagree with me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>His charges were defeated 2-0 in the league at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park last season having missed a glut of first-half opportunities, Yoan Gouffran and Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my \xe2\x80\x93 now a Chelsea player \xe2\x80\x93 taking advantage with late and decisive goals. Diego Costa will return to the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 starting lineup after serving his own suspension in midweek, with Mourinho to choose between Mikel John Obi and Ramires to replace Matic. Both midfielders have been on the fringe to date this term, though Chelsea will resist any attempts by suitors to prise them away next month.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe played well at Newcastle last season but missed so many chances,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cWe lost other matches last season where we clearly did nothing to win: at Crystal Palace we did nothing to win. Newcastle was not one of these matches. But last season was last season. It\xe2\x80\x99s a big club. I knew that ever since I worked with Mr [Bobby] Robson. People there live for football, for the club, for the moment. They have a match at home, big passion, big club, and it\xe2\x80\x99s unbelievable they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a trophy for so many years. But a big club and I like to play there. I like very much to play there.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
