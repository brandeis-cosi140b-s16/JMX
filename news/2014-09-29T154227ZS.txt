b"<p>German football has long hailed those who keep a cool head in the heat of battle. Those who don\xe2\x80\x99t, even through no fault of their own, can expect stern criticism or, at the very least, plenty of ridicule. Poor Christoph Kramer, for example, will be unable to live down his concussion-induced confusion during the World Cup final against Argentina, when he asked the referee to confirm that this was indeed the World Cup final he was playing in. On Saturday, Manuel Neuer (\xe2\x80\x9che wanted to go in goal\xe2\x80\x9d), Philipp Lahm (\xe2\x80\x9che wanted to take my armband off me\xe2\x80\x9d) and Thomas M\xc3\xbcller (\xe2\x80\x9che kept on calling me Gerd\xe2\x80\x9d) gently made fun of the Borussia M\xc3\xb6nchengladbach midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s Maracan\xc3\xa3 blackout in interviews with ZDF Sportstudio. Augsburg coach Markus Weinzierl, too, saw the lighter side of temporary memory loss. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that the Netherlands are World champions now,\xe2\x80\x9d Weinzierl joked about the Dutch defender Paul Verhaegh going off with a head injury in the 1-0 win over Hertha and forgetting a few details of the game in the process.</p> <p>In the Revierderby, however, the usual rules of engagement don\xe2\x80\x99t apply. The clash between the Ruhr neighbours Schalke 04 and Borussia Dortmund never knowingly undersells its emotional pull. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pathos machine, pumping out random patterns of capital letter feelings (HATE-LOVE-JOY-PAIN) that come over the two sets of supporters like a biblical plague. Otherwise normal, well-adjusted human beings are turned into nervous wrecks twice a season and, what\xe2\x80\x99s more, they\xe2\x80\x99re happy to suspend all rational detachment despite being perfectly aware of their affliction. Think of Disneyland\xe2\x80\x99s Thunder Mountain ride, through a deserted mine past smouldering sticks of dynamite and cold showers, then replace the dusty Wild West theme with North-Rhine Westphalian post-industrial grit and you\xe2\x80\x99re almost there. Once in motion, fans, players and club officials can\xe2\x80\x99t get off the roller-coaster, even if they wanted to.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis game, on my birthday - it\xe2\x80\x99s a gift from god,\xe2\x80\x9d said Schalke\xe2\x80\x99s Ralf F\xc3\xa4hrmann, who turned 26 on Saturday. The Royal Blues keeper confessed to having \xe2\x80\x9ctears in my eyes\xe2\x80\x9d at the final whistle and added that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t think of anything more beautiful than winning the derby \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9capart from becoming a dad, perhaps.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI will probably have to drink a tea to fall asleep tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d he added after his side\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 victory of their local rivals. The words \xe2\x80\x9cincredible\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cdream\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cindescribable\xe2\x80\x9d featured heavily in the statements of his team-mates; new striker and goal-scorer Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting, who had experienced derbies with Mainz and Hertha before, was instantly convinced that \xe2\x80\x9ceverything is a size bigger in this one - the mother of all derbies\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>A defeat would have turned up the volume of the crisis talk but now Dortmund find their ears ringing. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will go home and have a shit evening,\xe2\x80\x9d said a dejected J\xc3\xbcrgen Klopp after the third defeat in six games. Individual mistakes at the back \xe2\x80\x93 they were 2-0 down inside 23 minutes at the Veltins-Arena \xe2\x80\x93 and a lack of fluidity in wake of too many injures have seen Dortmund slip to 12th. They\xe2\x80\x99re closer to the relegation places than to league leaders Bayern Munich, who won 2-0 at K\xc3\xb6ln at the moment. Their neighbours\xe2\x80\x99 pain is particularly sweet for the Royal Blues faithful these days: Dortmund\xe2\x80\x99s meteoric rise under Klopp had put Schalke\xe2\x80\x99s lack of sustained progress in sharp contrast.</p> <p>Schadenfreude soothes the soul, but a few things made Schalke\xe2\x80\x99s success in the biggest game of the season bigger still. Firstly, it capped off a great, unexpectedly positive run of results that had begun with the 1-1 draw at Chelsea. A raft of injuries and coach Jens Keller\xe2\x80\x99s modest record against very good sides in both Europe and the Bundesliga had suggested very different outcomes. The win over the Black and Yellows has put Schalke back in touch with the Champions League places, and there\xe2\x80\x99s just a suggestion that Schalke, a byword for thwarted ambition in recent seasons, could be a little more than the sum of its parts under Keller \xe2\x80\x93 in terms of collective endeavour, at least. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we always play with that kind of passion, our future is looking good,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Dutch striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar.</p> <p>Keller proudly received ovations from the terraces, walking with his legs apart \xe2\x80\x9clike John Wayne,\xe2\x80\x9d as S\xc3\xbcddeutsche Zeitung noted. The 43-year-old has often come across more like a slightly-out-of-his-depth substitute teacher than as the gun-slinging sheriff during his 21-month reign but his talent for survival has proved remarkable. He\xe2\x80\x99s won more must-win games than anybody can count. A few more similar results domestically and in the Champions League, where Schalke face NK Maribor and then Sporting next, will probably force the sporting director Horst Heldt to extend Keller\xe2\x80\x99s contract beyond the summer after all. But Schalke wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be Schalke if this purple patch didn\xe2\x80\x99t come with some doubts. Heldt explained that a last-minute changing room speech from reserve keeper Christian Wetklo had fired up the team \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cit was a Saturday sermon that got everyone going.\xe2\x80\x9d In light of that deliberate revelation, it was only natural to ask why Keller\xe2\x80\x99s regular addresses don\xe2\x80\x99t always have the same effect. Klopp\xe2\x80\x99s press conference plea for the local media to be more supportive of his colleague will have made a few Schalke fans wonder about the Dortmund manager\xe2\x80\x99s motives as well. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope that this win has an effect on you,\xe2\x80\x9d Klopp told reporters. Was he being genuinely supportive of a fellow embattled coach or rooting for Keller to stay in the job as long as possible for his own reasons? (Both can be true at the same time, of course)</p> <p>Heldt will have to come up with some definitive answers in the coming months. On Saturday, though, matters of the heart happily took precedent over those of the mind. \xe2\x80\x9cToday is the day of joy,\xe2\x80\x9d the 44-year-old said, \xe2\x80\x9cthinking about the next game straight away makes no sense\xe2\x80\x9d. Dortmund will have to wait until the return of derby day in February for a shot at experiencing this blissful state.</p> Talking Points <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 We know from Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho that little horses don\xe2\x80\x99t win title races. But what about foals? Borussia M\xc3\xb6nchengladbach have fairly quietly galloped into second spot thanks to a 2-1 win over the former league leaders SC Paderborn. Bild revealed that the coach, Lucien Favre\xe2\x80\x99s contract comes with a bonus for winning the league, so someone, somewhere believes in the possibility. Ten games unbeaten in all competitions is certainly a record worthy of optimism and in the Bundesliga it\xe2\x80\x99s their best start to a campaign in almost 40 years. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can look upwards,\xe2\x80\x9d said the midfielder Granit Xhaka. Qualification for the Champions League is a realistic target, especially if the weakness of bigger and wealthier clubs is taken into account.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Hamburger SV (18th) and Werder Bremen (17th), brothers grim from the north, have no choice but to look up, unfortunately. There\xe2\x80\x99s nobody behind them anymore. Werder were much worse than the narrow 2-1 defeat at Wolfsburg suggests. Hamburg, however, were simply unlucky that Lucas Piaz\xc3\xb3n, on loan from Chelsea, scored a wonder-goal in the last minute to make it 2-1 to Frankfurt. His 30m free-kick looked to be heading for the North Sea before it dropped out of the sky and into Jaroslav Drobny\xe2\x80\x99s goal. The visitors had shown little else of note during Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s game but, despite Hamburg scoring their first goal of the season, theirs proved a pointless endeavour yet again. Fears that a new Bundesliga-record run of 508 scoreless minutes at the beginning of the season could remain their only stand-out achievement will not be easily dispelled any time soon.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Was it 204 (Bild, Handelsblatt) or even 206 (Spiegel Online, Welt) touches for Xabi Alonso? The Bundesliga\xe2\x80\x99s official website has gone with the lower number, which is still easily ahead of the previous league record set by Thiago Alc\xc3\xa2ntara (177) last season. Alonso himself had no idea \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t count\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 about the extent of his domination in the 2-0 win at K\xc3\xb6ln but his performance served as further proof that buying him was an inspired idea.</p>         Xabi Alonso breaks league passing record | Bundesliga | Talking Points     <p>Bayern\xe2\x80\x99s decision to travel to Moscow one day early before their Champions League match against CSKA back-fired, however, if you will pardon the pun. They had to evacuate their rooms on account of an inauspiciously timed fire-alarm on Sunday night. Maybe the hotel will lay on a nice complimentary spread of lasagne on Monday night to make up for the inconvenience.</p> <p>Results: Mainz 0-0 Hoffenheim, Schalke 04 2-1 Dortmund, Freiburg 0-0 Leverkusen, Stuttgart 1-0 Hannover, K\xc3\xb6ln 0-2 Bayern, Paderborn 1-2 Gladbach, Wolfsburg 2-1 Werder Bremen, Augsburg 1-0 Hertha, Hamburger SV 1-2 Frankfurt.</p>      Pos Team P GD Pts      1 Bayern Munich 6 9 14    2 Borussia M'gladbach 6 4 12    3 Bayer Leverkusen 6 2 11    4 Mainz 6 4 10    5 TSG Hoffenheim 6 4 10    6 Hannover 96 6 1 10    7 Eintracht Frankfurt 6 1 9    8 Augsburg 6 0 9    9 Wolfsburg 6 2 8    10 Schalke 04 6 0 8    11 Paderborn 6 -2 8    12 Borussia Dortmund 6 -2 7    13 Cologne 6 -1 6    14 Hertha Berlin 6 -4 5    15 VfB Stuttgart 6 -5 5    16 SC Freiburg 6 -3 4    17 Werder Bremen 6 -6 3    18 Hamburg 6 -7 2     "
