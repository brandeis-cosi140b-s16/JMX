b'Saturday Sundae: Patrick Bamford not Livin\xe2\x80\x99 on a Prayer at the Etihad'


b'MEN OF THE DAY <p>Filipe Morais and Billy Knott, the Chelsea rejects at the heart of Bradford\xe2\x80\x99s almighty win at Stamford Bridge. Knott, released by Carlo Ancelotti, set up the first; Morais, who turned down a contract offer from Mourinho in 2004, hit the second.</p> HISTORY MAKERS <p>5,573: The number of days since Chelsea last lost at home having led by two or more goals. The last side to turn them over was Arsenal in 1999.</p> ODD ONE OUT COMPETITION <p>These teams have scored four or more in games against Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s sides: Barcelona, Borussia Dortmund, Spurs and Bradford City. Only one did it away from home.</p> SONG OF THE DAY <p>Patrick Bamford, Middlesbrough\xe2\x80\x99s first scorer, had been to the Etihad Stadium once before \xe2\x80\x93 to see a Bon Jovi concert. Whether he treated Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s opponents to a rendition of You Give Manchester City a Bad Name remains unknown.</p> FINEST GOAL SPREE <p>Watford\xe2\x80\x99s second-half avalanche against Blackpool, when they averaged a goal every 6 minutes and 26 seconds as they turned a 2-0 half-time deficit into a 7-2 win.</p> GOOD DAY FOR <p>Arsenal outcasts. Yaya Sanogo and Marouane Chamakh started for Palace, and scored three in 28 minutes.</p> BEST PRONUNCIATION <p>Aiming to match last week\xe2\x80\x99s Louis van Gaal \xe2\x80\x9cQueens Park Raisins\xe2\x80\x9d moment, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho stepped up when asked if he had underestimated Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s opponents: \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you say their name? Barnsley?\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
