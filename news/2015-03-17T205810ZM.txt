b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini was in defiant mood as he urged Manchester City to prove they are continental heavyweights by knocking Barcelona out of the Champions League at the Camp Nou on Wednesday evening.</p> <p>The manager\xe2\x80\x99s position may be under scrutiny because of City\xe2\x80\x99s faltering Premier League defence but Pellegrini maintained his cool demeanour when sending out a message of defiance here, a stance echoed by Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9.</p> <p>City trail Barcelona 2-1 after the first leg of this last-16 tie, so know they need to score at least twice against Lionel Messi, Neymar, Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez and co to reach the Champions League quarter-finals for the first time.</p> <p>Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s side include players of the quality of Tour\xc3\xa9, Joe Hart, Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero, David Silva and Vincent Kompany, and the manager agreed it was time for City to get a result against a European aristocrat. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a good opportunity for our team and the only way to prove it is to beat one of the biggest teams in Europe \xe2\x80\x93 and we have that chance,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p>  <p> Related: Manuel Pellegrini: I\xe2\x80\x99ve never felt that if I don\xe2\x80\x99t win I\xe2\x80\x99m out at Manchester City </p>   <p>Kompany has suffered a dip in form and was dropped for the recent victory over Leicester City. As might be expected, Tour\xc3\xa9 backed his captain and reiterated how City must now show they belong in elite company. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery player have some doubt, some problems, it\xe2\x80\x99s part of football and the year. Sometimes you can have ups and down but he will have full focus because this game is very important for us and I hope we will deliver,\xe2\x80\x9d the midfielder said.</p> <p>Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s job may come under threat if the title challenge fizzles out and the Champions League campaign ends at Camp Nou. Asked if he believed the players have some responsibility for Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s predicament and that knocking out Barcelona may help secure his future, Tour\xc3\xa9 said: \xe2\x80\x9cFootball is like that. Last year being brilliant, everyone saying Manchester City [are a] top team in Europe \xe2\x80\x93 all of a sudden we have some problems and we\xe2\x80\x99re the worst team in the world. We can deal with that.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe all know what we have to do, the owners have spent a lot of money to make this one of the top clubs in Europe. We have had some difficulties but we are working hard. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the first time we have been in this situation. We\xe2\x80\x99ll try to do it for the fans and the club, and the people who continue to help us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pep Guardiola is expected to be at Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s game, a first return to the club he coached to two Champions League triumphs before taking a year\xe2\x80\x99s sabbatical. Now manager at Bayern Munich, the Spaniard is City\xe2\x80\x99s first choice to replace Pellegrini should he be removed.</p> <p>Pressed about speculation in the local media here regarding his job, Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the Catalunya press says but I have one more year left and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident I\xe2\x80\x99m going to finish my contract, so I have no comment on that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>While City trail Chelsea by six points in the Premier League and have played a game more, Barcelona lead La Liga by a point, having won their past six outings. Yet Pellegrini denied his players have less confidence in him than Bar\xc3\xa7a do in their coach, Luis Enrique. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know the kind of confidence my players have in me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know what football is. You could have asked the question the other way round if we were talking two months ago. All teams go through different moments and we will try to do our best with dedication and hard work.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Tour\xc3\xa9 missed the first leg, completing a three-game suspension for being sent off in the home defeat by CSKA Moscow. Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cI always say that we can play without Yaya but if you ask me I prefer to have Yaya in my team. He\xe2\x80\x99s a very important player for us. Tomorrow it is a big game and he is used to that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>If Tour\xc3\xa9 and his team-mates were watching to see if the pressure is affecting Pellegrini they will have been left in no doubt after this composed performance. The manager added: \xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all, I respect all opinions but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think my seat is in danger but even if it was I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything differently, I would do the same thing and focus and concentrate on the game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>There was even an answer to Andr\xc3\xa9s Iniesta, who earlier in the day had urged Bar\xc3\xa7a to make City suffer. Pellegrini listened to these comments and then said he was confident his players can do harm to Bar\xc3\xa7a when it counts.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe must try to do it, we are not going to play against an easy team but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that if the three ties we played before were 11 v 11 it could have been different,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, alluding to how Pablo Zabaleta, Mart\xc3\xadn Demichelis and Ga\xc3\xabl Clichy were sent off in each of the three previous legs played between the sides in the last year.</p> <p>If City can eliminate Bar\xc3\xa7a before their own crowd it will go down as a defining victory of the Sheikh Mansour era and make Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s own future with the club more secure.</p>'
