b'West Bromwich Albion 2-2 Manchester United: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>If Manchester United could ever be encouraged by a draw at West Brom secured by an 87th-minute goal having twice fallen behind and despite having a paper-thin defence that habitually stands way too far from its own goal, this was perhaps it. They got themselves some serious momentum at times, demonstrated some admirable bouncebackability, and massively dominated all but the most important of statistical metrics (the scoreline, obviously). Their midfield was good, particularly after Fellaini came on and before Di Maria went off, but there are problems both in defence and in attack, where Van Persie didn\xe2\x80\x99t do very much. Chelsea and Manchester City might show up their deficiencies even more starkly. Still, small steps and all that.</p> <p>While I\xe2\x80\x99m here, Sky eked a cluster of cliches out of Berahino after the final whistle. Just as well he is, as he points out, letting his football do the talking: \xe2\x80\x9cI thought we did really well to get the second goal. We\xe2\x80\x99re just disappointed to have conceded. I felt like if I could stay focused, when the chance came I\xe2\x80\x99d back myself to take it. I\xe2\x80\x99m just enjoying my football, I\xe2\x80\x99m letting my football do the talking, and I\xe2\x80\x99m delighted to be contributing to the team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Finally, here\xe2\x80\x99s a little challenge to amateur lip-readers out there. Sadly we don\xe2\x80\x99t know who he was muttering about. Bye!</p>     '
