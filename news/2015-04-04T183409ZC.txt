b'Chelsea v Stoke City: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93as it happened'


b'<p>Peep! Peep! Peeeeeep! It\xe2\x80\x99s all over. They made heavy enough weather of it, but Chelsea have held on to win and secure three points that take them seven points clear of Arsenal with a game in hand. Eden Hazard opened the scoring, only for Charlie Adam to equalise with a super piece of improvisation from inside his own half. Loic Remy restored Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s lead after Hazard had capitalised on a mix-up between Asmir Begovic and Steven N\xe2\x80\x99Zonzi. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all good news for Chelsea, however: Diego Costa limped off with a serious looking hamstring problem and may well be out for the rest of the season. </p>'
