b'Romelu Lukaku can play his way back to full fitness, says Everton manager'


b'<p>Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez has no plans to rest Romelu Lukaku, who has been underperforming for Everton since his \xc2\xa328m move from Chelsea in the summer, and believes the striker can play his way back to full fitness and effectiveness.</p> <p>The Everton manager, who is preparing to face Aston Villa on Saturday, accepts the Belgian has not looked as sharp as he did last season, when he was on loan at Goodison, but says his fitness programme after returning from the World Cup was hampered by a toe injury.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRomelu doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be dropped, he\xe2\x80\x99s not fatigued or overworked,\xe2\x80\x9d Mart\xc3\xadnez said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has been putting himself up for selection when we know he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t 100%, and that is why he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been showing quite the same power and intensity that he produced last season. We just need to make sure we give him the right training programme and allow him a bit of space and time.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe goal he scored against Crystal Place was Romelu back to his best, but we need him to replicate that more often. Within 90 minutes this season Romelu might produce three or four outstanding actions whereas the figure last season was 10 to 15. That is what we need to work towards.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mart\xc3\xadnez is at pains to stress he is not blaming a summer in Brazil for draining the player. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see any sign that he is carrying anything from the World Cup. That is completely over. He has become the most important player for Belgium but he is still very much focused at club level and ready to have a strong season.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe is currently operating at about 80% effectiveness, which is still pretty good, but we need to get him back to 100%. We can give him some specific programmes in training to help get back the power and pace he needs in his game. There is no question of being fatigued, or mentally unready. I think slowly he is getting back to his strongest.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
