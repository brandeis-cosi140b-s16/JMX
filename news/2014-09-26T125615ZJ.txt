b'<p>Diego Costa will start for Chelsea against Aston Villa on Saturday with Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho admitting the London club are helpless to prevent the forward from being called up by Spain for next month\xe2\x80\x99s Euro 2016 qualifiers despite his recent hamstring problems.</p> <p>Costa, a \xc2\xa332m signing from Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid this summer, is unable to play twice in four days at present after consistently suffering discomfort in his left hamstring. The injury had flared up in a friendly win against France earlier this month to rule him out of the second of Spain\xe2\x80\x99s matches, a qualifier against Macedonia, and requires a period of rest to heal properly. Ideally, Chelsea would like him to enjoy a break during the forthcoming international window.</p> <p>Yet, unless the forward suffers a relapse against Villa, Sporting Lisbon or Arsenal in the games ahead, they are braced for Costa to be called up for Spain\xe2\x80\x99s games in Slovakia and Luxembourg on 9 and 12 October. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m nobody to make that decision,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho when asked if he would hope to persuade Spain against calling up the Brazil-born forward when they announce their squad next week.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEverything is clear. Everybody knows what is going on with Diego. Everyone knows he\xe2\x80\x99s been in trouble for quite a long time. But the moment a national team wants to select a Chelsea player, I\xe2\x80\x99m nobody. It\xe2\x80\x99s their decision.</p>     Chelsea want Costa on the pitch full-time. Photograph: Paul Gilham/Getty Images    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey can call up the players, play them, do what they want. It\xe2\x80\x99s completely out of my control. What I think and what I feel doesn\xe2\x80\x99t play a part. We can communicate [with the federation], send exams and reports, but it\xe2\x80\x99s their decision in the end. After the game against Arsenal, or even before that when they make the pre-selection, everything is in their hands. I can do nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Costa was rested for Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s Capital One Cup win over Bolton Wanderers as he had been in the Champions League against Schalke a week earlier. But, having scored seven goals in five Premier League appearances to date, he will start against third-placed Villa at Stamford Bridge despite Chelsea travelling to Lisbon on Monday for their European tie against Sporting.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe plays tomorrow and starts the game without problems,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mourinho, who will be without Ramires until after the international break after the midfielder suffered a groin injury. \xe2\x80\x9cThe question is always the same: can he finish the game and be in condition to play in Lisbon 48 hours later? That I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone is working hard to help Diego. He is the first to do that, too. He\xe2\x80\x99s working hard in his recovery, with the medical staff and the conditioning staff, trying to be ready for every game. Mentally, he\xe2\x80\x99s ready for every game. Physically he\xe2\x80\x99s not. Everyone is trying hard for him to be able to play every game.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut, at this moment, because I don\xe2\x80\x99t think about Sporting or the Champions League, I think about Villa in the Premier League and he plays for sure. He\xe2\x80\x99s in a good position to start. If he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t play against Sporting, I play [Didier] Drogba or [Lo\xc3\xafc] R\xc3\xa9my. But that\xe2\x80\x99s another game, another story. I play tomorrow with the team I think is the best to win against Villa. After that, I will face the consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
