b'<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s that! Arsenal rode their luck - they were second best for much of this game, and further replays suggest the visitors may well have deserved a penalty when Wilshere clipped Motta - but they\xe2\x80\x99ve fought their way through to the Champions League group phase. That\xe2\x80\x99s 17 in a row now for Arsenal. Seventeenth time lucky? It\xe2\x80\x99s about that time for this grand club.</p>'
