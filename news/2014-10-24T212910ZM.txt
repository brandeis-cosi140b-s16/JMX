b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini wants Manchester City to put pressure on Chelsea by beating West Ham United in Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s early kick-off. The City manager is hopeful that by next month\xe2\x80\x99s international break the champions can overhaul the leaders.</p> <p>City travel to Upton Park knowing a win will close the gap with Chelsea to two points. Pellegrini hopes this may cause Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s team to slip up at Manchester United on Sunday. He also mentioned Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Liverpool on 8 November.</p> <p>Asked if City can apply pressure, Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, if we win, maybe. Chelsea have two very difficult games away with Manchester United and Liverpool. It\xe2\x80\x99s one moment to try to win our points and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see before the international break how many points they have.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini said Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero\xe2\x80\x99s strong start \xe2\x80\x93 the striker has 11 goals in 11 appearances \xe2\x80\x93 and injury-free run is down to how he began the season. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you remember in the first games in August we made him mix between pre-season and the start of the Premier League. That was very important for him to try to recover 100% fitness. He had just finished an important World Cup and he had many days to rest. The way he prepared his season in August is very important on what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
