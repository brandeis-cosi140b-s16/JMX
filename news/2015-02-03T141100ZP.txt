b'<p>Football\xe2\x80\x99s Twitter crowds drummed their global fingers in boredom towards the close of the 2015 winter transfer window but, while there was no last-day rush for thrill-seekers, clubs\xe2\x80\x99 spending finally reached around \xc2\xa3130m, fairly normal for this time of year. The perception of it being particularly quiet is partly due to the hazy memory of January as a time of frenzy which stretches back four years now, to the barminess of 2011.</p> <p>That final day, when Chelsea signed Fernando Torres for \xc2\xa350m from Liverpool, thereby releasing the famous helicopter to buzz Andy Carroll to Anfield from Newcastle for the forever extraordinary \xc2\xa335m, now prompts red faces all round. Chelsea made the headline signing this deadline day, paying a significant \xc2\xa323.3m for the Colombian winger Juan Cuadrado, but maintained their recently-minted practice of lucrative selling by moving Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle to the Bundesliga\xe2\x80\x99s upwardly mobile Wolfsburg for \xc2\xa324m and Ryan Bertrand to Southampton for another \xc2\xa310m.</p> <p>Chelsea epitomised flash spending in the first years of Russian-oligarch ownership, but now embody a craftier reflection of Roman Abramovich\xe2\x80\x99s style, with \xe2\x80\x9cpartner\xe2\x80\x9d clubs like Vitesse Arnhem, and the accusation they hoard players to sell to balance the books.</p>       <p>While hefty spending has continued to stay in step with the Abu Dhabi oil fortune lavished on Manchester City, Abramovich\xe2\x80\x99s lieutenants have recouped \xc2\xa3163m in the past year from the sale of seven players including Sch\xc3\xbcrrle, Bertrand, Demba Ba (\xc2\xa38m), Kevin De Bruyne (\xc2\xa318m), David Luiz (\xc2\xa340m), Romelu Lukaku (\xc2\xa328m) and, the deal which made last January\xe2\x80\x99s a box-office final day, Juan Mata, \xc2\xa337m to Manchester United. Meanwhile Torres, putting an end to his strange and sorry Chelsea story, completed his move to Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid this month, for nothing.</p> <p>It was no great surprise at United that after last year, and the record \xc2\xa3150m summer splurge to belatedly compensate for Sir Alex Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s exit, this month was a time of allowing excess players to leave, including Wilfried Zaha to Crystal Palace permanently and Darren Fletcher, after 362 man-and-boy appearances, to West Bromwich Albion.</p> <p>United\xe2\x80\x99s flurry of summer signings, cracking years of relative restraint for the Glazers enabled by Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s genius, and the overall record of a vast \xc2\xa3835m spent by all clubs, provides the context for this quieter January.</p> <p>City, after \xc2\xa350m made available for Mark Hughes in Sheikh Mansour\xe2\x80\x99s first transfer window six years ago, have resisted febrile January deals, apart from 2011 when buying Edin Dzeko for \xc2\xa327m from Wolfsburg. So the purchase of Wilfried Bony to strengthen a strikers roster including Dzeko, Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero (who cost \xc2\xa338m) and Stevan Jovetic (\xc2\xa322m), was a statement of intent, to catch Chelsea in the Premier League and not to be intimidated by Uefa\xe2\x80\x99s financial fair play sanction.</p> <p>That \xc2\xa325m signing of Bony, the biggest deal of the window, also reinforced the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s financial disparities, leaving a major hole at Swansea City, who are recognised to be well run but remain a selling club at the right price.</p> <p>Since the Andy Carroll \xc2\xa335m in its first transfer window, John Henry\xe2\x80\x99s Boston-based Fenway Sports Group has sought to align Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s spending more recognisably to its reputation for Moneyball value-analysis, which was better characterised by signing Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez, on the same final day as Carroll, for \xc2\xa317.2m less. Anfield sceptics are yet to be convinced, however, and will not be greatly cheered by the lack of activity this month.</p>     Spending between Premier League clubs, on foreign-based players and from lower league clubs.

Photograph: NIGEL RODDIS/REUTERS    <p>Arsenal, quietly, reinforced their defence with the \xc2\xa311.3m signing of Gabriel Paulista from Villarreal, while elsewhere, not too much happened. The exceptions were for new managers: Crystal Palace stocking the training ground for Alan Pardew, and Palace\xe2\x80\x99s former manager, Tony Pulis, spending \xc2\xa34.5m on Callum McManaman from Wigan as well as acquiring Fletcher\xe2\x80\x99s drive.</p> <p>January two years ago was entertained by Queens Park Rangers, already odds-on doomed to relegation, splashing \xc2\xa320m on Christopher Samba and Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my in a vain hope of newly appointed manager Harry Redknapp keeping them up. This time, although second from bottom, QPR, threatened with a huge fine from the Championship for spectacularly overspending financial fair play limits when winning promotion last season, desisted. Hull City did land Dame N\xe2\x80\x99Doye from Lokomotiv Moscow for \xc2\xa33m and saw Tom Ince leave on loan for Derby, but panic was eerily absent from Burnley while Leicester City paid \xc2\xa39m for Andrej Kramaric, a 23-year-old Croatia striker, to boost their chances of staying up.</p> <p>Overall, there is a sense of the Premier League clubs managing themselves more prudently, perhaps nudged by financial fair play rules now in force in their own league as well as Uefa\xe2\x80\x99s. But spending over 2014-15, during this greatest ever \xc2\xa35.5bn TV deal from 2013\xe2\x80\x9116, is huge, almost \xc2\xa31bn. What should not be missed, beneath the headline arrivals, are all the exits, permanent or on loan, of young players, mostly British, for whom there is no room in England\xe2\x80\x99s modern top flight.</p>     How January spending in the Premier League compares to the rest of Europe '
