b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho reveals the Special One\xe2\x80\x99s special watches'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has celebrated each of the 21 trophies he has won as a manager by removing his watch and keeping it as a memento. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I win titles the gifts are for my wife, my daughter and my son,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI take my watch from my wrist and I don\xe2\x80\x99t wear it again. A big collection? I have a big collection. I keep it. They\xe2\x80\x99re in a safe box. Like people keep medals or shirts, I keep my watches. Another thing is if I don\xe2\x80\x99t win, the watch becomes a normal watch, so I wear, I don\xe2\x80\x99t wear, I wear, I don\xe2\x80\x99t wear. But when I finish a season with a trophy, that season is represented with a watch. I have 21.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho, who is sponsored by watch manufacturer Hublot, does admit he has a favourite. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the last one, because I designed it and the company did it for me according to my needs to be on the bench and the colours I want and the material and the size and the weight,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI designed it with the company. It\xe2\x80\x99s my watch. It\xe2\x80\x99s blue.\xe2\x80\x9d He also recalled what his first watch was like: \xe2\x80\x9ccheaper\xe2\x80\x9d.</p>'
