b'Middlesbrough 0-2 Norwich | Championship play-off final match report'


b'<p>They played like a team that was in a hurry to get back to the Premier League. Norwich City had dismantled the most parsimonious defence in the Championship inside the opening quarter of an hour and at the final whistle it was the yellow end, rather than Middlesbrough\xe2\x80\x99s banks of red, where the euphoria could be found.</p> <p>At the other side of the stadium, they did at least buck the modern trend of deserting en masse as soon as it became apparent there was no way back for their team. Yet the damage inflicted on Middlesbrough during those three minutes when the goals were scored was always likely to be grievous. The last time they won from 2-0 down was back in 2006 when Steve McClaren was manager, Mark Viduka partnered Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink in attack and the opposition was Steaua Bucharest in a Uefa Cup semi-final. The modern-day team do not have a Viduka or Hasselbaink and, though they did rally briefly in the second half, there were only fleeting moments when they seriously threatened. Ultimately, there could be no dispute that promotion had gone to the more rounded team.</p>  <p> Related: Norwich too good for Middlesbrough thanks to Alex Neil\xe2\x80\x99s canny approach | Paul Doyle </p>   <p>Norwich, in the process, have been richly rewarded for having the nerve and foresight to appoint Alex Neil from Hamilton Academical when they needed a new manager in January. Neil comes from Bellshill, the same north Lanarkshire town where Sir Matt Busby grew up, and seems intent on reminding us about Scotland\xe2\x80\x99s prolific production line of managers after a season in which Paul Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s sacking at Aston Villa had left England\xe2\x80\x99s top division without one from north of the border. At 33, Neil will be one of the youngest managers of the Premier League era and there is plenty to admire judging by the way this team have improved under him.</p> <p>The trophy had barely been lifted before the first press release went out from the bookmakers announcing Norwich as odds-on to go down next season. It is almost standard practice these days because of the gulf between the two divisions but Neil has given the club a new sense of momentum and his squad is not short of players with experience of coping at the highest level. What cannot be disputed is the financial rewards are enormous, at around \xc2\xa3130m. And what about the prestige? \xe2\x80\x9cPeople keep telling me I was at Arbroath in front of 700 fans at the start of the season,\xe2\x80\x9d Neil said.</p> <p>Middlesbrough will wonder whether it might have been different if the volley that Jelle Vossen slashed towards John Ruddy\xe2\x80\x99s net after nine minutes had been a couple inches lower rather than clanging off the crossbar. They should not dwell on that moment too long, however.</p> <p>Bradley Johnson had done the same for Norwich barely 30 seconds earlier and the bottom line is that Aitor Karanka\xe2\x80\x99s side chose a bad day to lose their qualities of defensive structure and organisation. It was difficult at times to remember this was a team that had accumulated 22 clean sheets and beaten Norwich twice this season, scoring five times and not conceding once. They paid a heavy price for being so error-prone and the game was a personal ordeal in particular for Daniel Ayala, a former Norwich player, bearing in mind it was his dithering on the ball that began the sequence of mistakes that led to the first goal.</p> <p>Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s mix-up with Dean Whitehead left Cameron Jerome advancing from the flank, probably expecting at least one opponent would come across to block off the shot. It never happened. The next defender, Ben Gibson, hung back, mistakenly thinking Jerome would look for a team-mate, and the goalkeeper, Dimitrios Konstantopoulos, also seemed to be caught in two minds. Jerome weighed up his options, lined up the angles and turned his shot inside the near post.</p> <p>As the Norwich players went to congratulate Jerome, Ayala\xe2\x80\x99s team-mates gathered around the Spaniard to try to lift the defender\xe2\x80\x99s spirits. Yet it was not just Ayala who will leave with regrets. Patrick Bamford had a frustrating time in his final match on loan from Chelsea. Vossen was booked for diving before being substituted and maybe Karanka made a mistake as well by arranging for the coach to arrive at the stadium only 50 minutes before the kick-off.</p> <p>His worry, he explained, was that the players might be consumed by nerves if they spent too long in the dressing room. As it turned out, they could hardly have got off to a worse start.</p> <p>Neil\xe2\x80\x99s preparations had included a tour of Wembley last week so his players were used to the surroundings. They settled quickly and, even ignoring the goals, the opening quarter of an hour could be neatly encapsulated by the moment Wes Hoolahan, such a clever little footballer, slipped the ball through the legs of Grant Leadbitter.</p> <p>The opening goal came out of nowhere and, buoyed, it was a lovely sequence of crisp passes that culminated in Steven Whittaker playing in Nathan Redmond to double the lead. Redmond\xe2\x80\x99s first touch moved him away from Gibson and created the angle for him to take aim. The second was fired into the bottom corner and Neil\xe2\x80\x99s water bottle was launched into the air in celebration.</p>'
