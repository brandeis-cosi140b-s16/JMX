b'Premier League team of the season \xe2\x80\x93 the story so far'


b'Goalkeeper: David de Gea  <p>Trying to separate De Gea, Thibaut Courtois and Hugo Lloris is not an easy task. Courtois has been exceptional in his first season as Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s No1, while Lloris has regularly spared the blushes of a Tottenham defence that always offers encouragement to opposition strikers. Yet where would Manchester United be without De Gea\xe2\x80\x99s saves? The Spaniard\xe2\x80\x99s exploits have been jaw-dropping at times, his stand-out performance coming in the 3-0 win over Liverpool in December, and he has often been the difference between victory and defeat for Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s side. As good as Courtois has been, Chelsea would arguably still be top with Petr Cech in goal.</p> Right-back: Nathaniel Clyne <p>It probably would not have saved England from group-stage failure, but it remains a mystery why Roy Hodgson did not take the Southampton right-back to the World Cup. Clyne rarely puts a foot wrong and he has been excellent this season, quick, positionally aware, strong in the tackle and adventurous going forward. Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s H\xc3\xa9ctor Beller\xc3\xadn, Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Branislav Ivanovic, Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s Kieran Trippier and West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s Carl Jenkinson have all impressed, but Clyne deserves his spot in this team. And, perhaps, a permanent one for England. The 23-year-old is only going to get better.</p> Centre-back: Toby Alderweireld <p>While Southampton have been rightly praised for the quality of their football, part of their success has been down to their defensive record. Southampton have the meanest defence in the league, having only conceded 21 goals, and Alderweireld has caught the eye alongside Jos\xc3\xa9 Fonte. The Belgian defender is on a season-long loan from Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid and Southampton would love to sign him on a permanent basis in the summer.</p> Centre-back: John Terry <p>The Chelsea captain looked like he was reaching the end two years ago. Terry was not a fixture in the side under Rafael Ben\xc3\xadtez, with David Luiz and Gary Cahill seemingly rising above him in the pecking order, but he has discovered a new lease of life since Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho returned to Stamford Bridge. The 34-year-old has been as reliable as ever this season, scored Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s opening goal in their 2-0 win over Tottenham in the Capital One Cup final and is likely to extend his contract for at least another year.</p> Left-back: C\xc3\xa9sar Azpilicueta <p>Honourable mentions to Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s Ryan Bertrand and West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s Aaron Cresswell, but Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Spanish left-back is quietly enjoying another outstanding campaign. Although he is predominantly right-footed, it is testament to his defensive ability that he does not look out of place on the left.</p> Right wing: Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez <p>Although the Chilean\xe2\x80\x99s level has dipped since the turn of the year, his performances during the first half of the season should not be underestimated. He was often the sole shining light for Arsenal during a tricky period for Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s side and 19 goals in his debut season in England, with more potentially on the way, should not be sniffed at. It is questionable whether Arsenal would be in a position to finish in the top four without S\xc3\xa1nchez\xe2\x80\x99s efforts before Christmas, so he can be forgiven for a few tired displays.</p> Central midfield: Nemanja Matic  <p>Does anyone want to argue about the inclusion of Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant Serbian midfielder? No? Good.</p> Central midfield: Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas <p>The Spaniard has not been quite as effective in the past two months, his partnership with Matic disrupted by injuries and suspensions, but Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s dominance owes much to F\xc3\xa0bregas\xe2\x80\x99s assists and control in midfield. An on-form F\xc3\xa0bregas is comfortably the best midfielder in England.</p> Left wing: Eden Hazard <p>The Belgian is a player who demands special attention. It has become common to see two or three defenders trying to crowd Hazard out and block his path to goal, but he usually finds a way through, his touch, strength, balance and dribbling ability ensuring that he is always capable of wriggling away with the ball. The Chelsea winger has matured wonderfully, responding well to the way that Mourinho has pushed him, and he will surely be named player of the year.</p> Centre-forward: Diego Costa  <p>Marking the Chelsea striker cannot be a barrel of laughs. Not only does he constantly seem to be on a wind-up mission, snarling his way through games and picking countless fights with defenders, he is also a superb player. Mourinho did not bother to hide his displeasure with his forwards last season, but it is safe to say that he loves Costa. He has not been as prolific since the turn of the year, mainly because of the suspension he received for that stamp on Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Emre Can in January, but his 19 league goals have put Chelsea on course to win their first title since 2010.</p> Centre-forward: Harry Kane <p>If the Tottenham striker entered the general election as an independent candidate, he would win. Kane has been the story of the season, his boundless, puppyish energy and thirst for goals making it impossible to take your eyes off him. It took a while for the 21-year-old to convince Mauricio Pochettino of his worth, but he has not looked back since breaking into the side, scoring 29 goals in all competitions and earning his first England call-up. Having scored twice in the 5-3 win over Chelsea, he then went and scored both goals in Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 win over Arsenal, before scoring his first hat-trick in last Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s 4-3 win over Leicester City. Anyone who says they dislike him is a liar.</p> Substitutes <p>Thibaut Courtois, Ryan Bertrand, Laurent Koscielny, Santi Cazorla, Philippe Coutinho, Christian Eriksen, Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero.</p>'
