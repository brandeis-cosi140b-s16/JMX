b'The Fiver: Tat emporiums and ludicrous boardroom machinations | Scott Murray'


b'F@NNYING AROUND IN THE LOWER DIVISIONS <p>Just as a week is a long time in politics, so 21 years, 11 months and 23 days is a fair old while in football. And that\xe2\x80\x99s how long it\xe2\x80\x99s been since Nasty Leeds played Pope\xe2\x80\x99s Newc O\xe2\x80\x99Rangers in Big Cup as champions of their respective countries. How things have changed since then! Back then, O\xe2\x80\x99Rangers would finish the season having retained their Scottish title and come within a hair\xe2\x80\x99s breadth of reaching the European Cup final. Nasty Leeds meanwhile would meekly crash out of Europe twice, Ronny Deila style, and finish their title defence in 17th place, trailing behind the likes of Norwich, Blackburn, QPR, Wimbledon, Sheffield United, Coventry and Ipswich, having failed to win on the road all season. OK, Nasty Leeds had already gone down the swanny by the autumn of 1992. But the overall point stands: look how things have changed since Nasty Leeds played Pope\xe2\x80\x99s Newc O\xe2\x80\x99Rangers in Big Cup!</p> <p>Both clubs have, of course, spent recent years f@nnying around in the lower divisions as a result of ludicrous boardroom machinations. But today, at long last, things seem to be looking up for the beleaguered giants. Let\xe2\x80\x99s take O\xe2\x80\x99Rangers first. The club have just taken receipt of a whopping loan of \xc2\xa320 [subs, please check] from Mike Ashley, which for reasons the Fiver doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand, and can\xe2\x80\x99t be bothered to look into, effectively gives the Newcastle United owner control. Some fans may worry that Ashley will rename Ibrox after his tat emporiums, and convert the listed red-brick Bill Struth Stand into a tat emporium. But others might think it a price worth paying if Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s arrival leads to the exit of Ally McCoist, a man with a grasp of tactics so basic he could easily be confused for one of those people who write about tactics on the internet.</p> <p>Nasty Leeds are also hoping today might herald a bright new dawn, for having got rid of Darko Milanic, a man who made Brian Clough and Jock Stein look like Don Revie and Howard Wilkinson, they\xe2\x80\x99re set to install Neil Redfearn as head coach. Redfearn\xe2\x80\x99s last permanent appointment was at Northwich Victoria of the Conference, where he could only manage one point during a nine-game tenure. But in fairness to Redfearn, he did accrue 10 points from four matches recently at Nasty Leeds while holding the fort between the reigns of the aforementioned Milanic and his predecessor, the former Forest Green manager Peter Principle. Fans will embrace hope, then, though whether Redfearn will be given enough time to work more magic is, in the wake of the 32-day Milanic era, a moot point emphasised by owner Massimo Cellino\xe2\x80\x99s son Edoardo: \xe2\x80\x9cI remember in Italy my dad sacked seven coaches in one year and one before the season had even started. This is not a record.\xe2\x80\x9d Forget politics; a week is a long time at Nasty Leeds.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>26 October: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry but I can\xe2\x80\x99t continue.
