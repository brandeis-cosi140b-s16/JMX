b'Manchester City v West Bromwich Albion \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>Dzeko is six inches away from threading a shot into the bottom-left corner from 20 yards. And that\xe2\x80\x99s that. West Brom were always up against it, in the wake of that early red card, and so it proved. City ran out easy winners, and on another day would have had a hatful. No doubt there\xe2\x80\x99ll be some sort of controversy regarding the mistaken identity, McAuley walking instead of Dawson, but does it really make much difference? Ten men are ten men are ten men. West Brom remain comfortable in mid-table, above the relegation worries. City meanwhile move to within three points of Chelsea, who have two games in hand. But the title\xe2\x80\x99s still a possibility, albeit a long shot. A torrid week comes to a more than satisfactory end.</p>'
