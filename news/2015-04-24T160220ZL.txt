b'Louis van Gaal tells Marouane Fellaini to keep his focus against Everton'


b'<p>Louis van Gaal has spoken to Marouane Fellaini about maintaining his focus during Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s return to his former club Everton.</p> <p>Fellaini has emerged as a driving force in United\xe2\x80\x99s campaign after being a peripheral figure under the former manager, David Moyes, last season.</p> <p>Asked how he has helped improve Fellaini, Van Gaal said: \xe2\x80\x9cI am always communicating with my players about philosophy, about performance, about attitude, about behaviour and maybe one or two aspects more.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is what I\xe2\x80\x99m doing and not more than that. And when players believe in you they want to convince me because every player playing for Manchester United has qualities.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSo also I think Marouane Fellaini has qualities and we want to let dominate the qualities of Fellaini in the team and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we are trying to do and I believe that we are doing that. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why his performances are better just now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Gaal has no concern about Fellaini being targeted by Everton\xe2\x80\x99s players. \xe2\x80\x9cI have spoken with Fellaini because I know this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFellaini is always dry in his answers. He said: \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a game.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Yes, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a special game for you.\xe2\x80\x99 I hope the fans shall receive him like the Chelsea fans received Juan Mata  because I like that very much. I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s like that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Gaal refused to discuss if he has had any contact with PSV Eindhoven\xe2\x80\x99s Memphis Depay. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t discuss it with the media, you know my answer,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of the winger who played under him as Holland coach at last summer\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a lot of relationships with players. I cannot buy all the players I\xe2\x80\x99ve coached already.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Gaal also stated Robin van Persie faces a fight to regain his place following injury. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has to train very hard and play in the second team and show his qualities again,\xe2\x80\x9d said the manager. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I have to compare him with the positions he can play with the players in that position. It\xe2\x80\x99s always the same.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Only Daley Blind of United\xe2\x80\x99s injured players may be available for Everton. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the players are still injured. Only Blind maybe, it\xe2\x80\x99s a question mark, can reach the game against Everton. Jones, Carrick and Rojo cannot play against Everton,\xe2\x80\x9d said Van Gaal.</p> <p>He said the right-back Rafael da Silva would be out for the rest of the season after breaking his ribs in an Under-21 match against Leicester this week.</p>'
