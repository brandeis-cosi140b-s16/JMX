b'Premier League 2014-15: Club-by-club tactical guide to the season ahead | Michael Cox'


b'Arsenal <p>Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez is exactly what Arsenal needed \xe2\x80\x93 Olivier Giroud plays a useful role, but lacks pace, mobility and clinical finishing. S\xc3\xa1nchez provides all three of those qualities, and gives them another dimension. He can play alongside Giroud to offer variety to the attack although will often play instead of him, as a centre-forward.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Read Amy Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s full Arsenal season preview</p> Aston Villa <p>Paul Lambert will continue to vary his system, and both Kieran Richardson and Joe Cole are versatile players with experience at top clubs. The squad seems marginally more impressive than last year, but it remains to be seen whether Lambert can rediscover the tactical nous that made him so successful at Norwich.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Read Stuart James\xe2\x80\x99s full Aston Villa season preview</p> Burnley <p>With few big-name arrivals at Turf Moor, Sean Dyche may field a similar side to last season. Burnley are decent team, though: playing out from the back and pressing from the front, which could lead to a few shocks. However, having played 4\xe2\x80\x914\xe2\x80\x912 throughout last season, Dyche will need more midfield steel.</p>     Danny Ings is central to Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s hopes of avoiding relegation after scoring 21 goals in the Championship last season.

The general idea was obvious, and the attacking midfielders often turned in excellent displays, but Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side lacked raw class in certain positions. Diego Costa, Filipe Lu\xc3\xads and Cesc F\xc3\xa1bregas should fit into the 4-2-3-1 system perfectly, and the Blues look extremely strong.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Read Paul Doyle\xe2\x80\x99s full Chelsea season preview</p> Crystal Palace <p>Tony Pulis created a well-drilled side last season, and he won\xe2\x80\x99t significantly vary his system. The defence will continue to play very narrow, while a disciplined midfield cordon will work as a unit to prevent the opposition playing penetrative passes, and instead show them out wide. The centre-backs are happy to defend crosses.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Read Dominic Fifield\xe2\x80\x99s full Crystal Palace season preview</p> Everton <p>Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s starting XI has not changed, and neither will his default strategy. Expect 4-2-3-1 with a solid \xe2\x80\x98square\xe2\x80\x99 of defensive-minded players in the centre, allowing the full-backs to fly forward and the wingers to dart inside. However, Mart\xc3\xadnez increasingly tried tactical variations at the end of last season, and he may experiment more.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Read Andy Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s full Everton season preview</p> Hull City <p>Steve Bruce has concentrated on bolstering his squad for a Europa League campaign although the addition of two wide players, Tom Ince and Robert Snodgrass, suggests he could scrap the 3\xe2\x80\x915\xe2\x80\x912 that proved effective last season and turn to more of a 4-4-2 system.</p>     Robert Snodgrass was relegated last season with Norwich but impressed Steve Bruce enough to earn a \xc2\xa37m move to Hull. Photograph: Craig Brough/Action Images    <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Read Louise Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s full Hull City season preview</p> Leicester City <p>Nigel Pearson generally played a 4-4-2 system last year, and there is a danger Leicester could be overrun in midfield if playing a similar formation this time round. But the wingers are quick and both strikers are capable of clever finishes, so there is every chance Leicester could play direct football efficiently.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Read Ian McCourt\xe2\x80\x99s full Leicester City season preview</p> Liverpool <p>Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 tactical tinkering last season was often impressive, with 3-5-2, 4-3-3, 4-2-3-1 and a midfield diamond all used regularly. The arrival of Emre Can, Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Lazar Markovic means Rodgers has more options than last season, so expect plenty of formation switching this time round, too.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Read Andy Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s full Liverpool season preview</p> Manchester City <p>If their key attackers stay fit, City will have more firepower than last year: Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero missed half of that league campaign and Stevan Jovetic only started twice. Manuel Pellegrini has yet to field them together because of injuries, but theoretically a mobile, pacy duo is perfect for his free-flowing football.</p>     Stevan Jovetic (right) is expected to feature more in City\xe2\x80\x99s starting XI this campaign after struggling with injuries last season. Photograph: Carl Court/AFP/Getty Images    <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Read Jamie Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s full Man City season preview</p> Manchester United <p>Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s 3-4-1-2 system means an obvious change at the back, where Manchester United have lost experience \xe2\x80\x93 but the main benefit should be up front. This is the ideal formation for playing Juan Mata, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie in their favoured positions, and United\xe2\x80\x99s attacking play should be spectacular.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Read Jamie Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s full Manchester United season preview</p> Newcastle United <p>It is difficult to predict Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s season because four key attackers are new to English football. R\xc3\xa9my Cabella, Siem de Jong, Facundo Ferreyra and Emmanuel Rivi\xc3\xa8re could go either way, and while Graham Carr has identified some excellent signings in recent years, it is a lot of upheaval in one area.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Read Louise Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s full Newcastle United season preview</p> Queens Park Rangers <p>Three-man defences fared well at the World Cup, and Harry Redknapp is one of a number of Premier League managers set to deploy that system in 2014\xe2\x80\x9115. Rio Ferdinand and Steven Caulker provide class at the back while Mauricio Isla is a natural wing-back, so this shape seems to suit the squad nicely.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Read Paul Doyle\xe2\x80\x99s full QPR season preview</p> Southampton <p>A complete transformation in terms of playing staff means Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s season is highly unpredictable, especially with more signings to come. Ronald Koeman is a talented coach but neither Graziano Pell\xc3\xa8 nor Dusan Tadic are guaranteed successes, and it could be a few weeks before Koeman finds the right system.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Read Jacob Steinberg\xe2\x80\x99s full Southampton season preview</p> Stoke City <p>Once considered the league\xe2\x80\x99s ugliest side, Mark Hughes now has a plethora of talented forwards. Peter Odemwingie, Bojan Krkic, Mame Biram Diouf and Marko Arnautovic will all expect to start, but is it possible to play all four in a 4\xe2\x80\x912\xe2\x80\x913\xe2\x80\x911? Stoke are likely to score more, but might be more exposed at the back.</p>     Bojan has looked lively in pre-season and appears to have settle well since his move from Barcelona. Photograph: Chris Brunskill/Getty Images    <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Read Daniel Harris\xe2\x80\x99s full Stoke City season preview</p> Sunderland <p>Despite lots of transfer activity, Gustavo Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s side seem set to play in roughly the same style as last season, in a 4-5-1 with players of roughly the same quality. Some fine counter-attacking kept Sunderland in the division, so expect something similar this season, with the team relying on pace rather than possession.</p> <p>Read Louise Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s full Sunderland season preview</p> Swansea City <p>Garry Monk believes in continuing with Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy of steady possession play and clever movement in the final third. The defenders will continue to play out from the back, Leon Britton still dictates the passing moves from deep, while Jefferson Montero and Gylfi Sigurdsson provide more attacking quality.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Read Stuart James\xe2\x80\x99s full Swansea season preview</p> Tottenham Hotspur <p>Mauricio Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s system of energetic pressing proved popular at Southampton and he will hope to have more success than Andr\xc3\xa9 Villas-Boas with this approach at Spurs. Ultimately it depends on whether he can get Christian Eriksen, Erik Lamela, Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor on board with the philosophy, and playing to their full potential</p> West Bromwich Albion <p>Alan Irvine has signed a host of defenders \xe2\x80\x93 Joleon Lescott, Andre Wisdom, S\xc3\xa9bastien Pocognoli, Chris Baird, Christian Gamboa and Jason Davidson \xe2\x80\x93 and has suggested he could switch to a 3-5-2 system, giving wing-backs the licence to get forward and stretch the play. This makes sense with a team lacking genuine class out wide</p>     Joleon Lescott moved to West Brom on a free transfer after falling down the pecking order at Manchester City. Photograph: Matt West/BPI/REX    West Ham United <p>Some interesting signings give West Ham a more technical edge while also fitting in nicely with Sam Allardyce\xe2\x80\x99s style \xe2\x80\x93 Enner Valencia, the Ecuadorian forward with a prodigious leap, is the obvious example. However, there is still a worry that Allardyce\xe2\x80\x99s side will depend too much on crossing, an inefficient method of creating chances</p>'
