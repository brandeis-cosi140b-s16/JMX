b'West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s Sam Allardyce admits to Champions League regrets'


b'<p>It was with a mixture of wistfulness and his usual forthright bullishness that Sam Allardyce, briefly moving his attention away from the 21st-century football that West Ham United intend to confront Chelsea with on Friday afternoon, looked back eight years and contemplated what he might have achieved in his final season at Bolton Wanderers if he had received greater financial backing \xe2\x80\x93 or, to be precise, any financial backing \xe2\x80\x93 when his team were hovering around the Champions League places at Christmas.</p> <p>As eye-catching as West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s rise to fourth place has been, that really was an excellent and underrated side that Allardyce put together at unfashionable Bolton, masters at putting noses out of joint and winding up the big teams with their attempts at insurrection just below the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s glass ceiling.</p> <p>Like the current West Ham side, Allardyce\xe2\x80\x99s Bolton had a variety of attacking methods. Their prowess at set pieces was unrivalled and their physicality made them a nightmare to play against, especially at the Reebok Stadium, but the caricature of them as a dirty long-ball side was an unfair exaggeration: a midfield of Iv\xc3\xa1n Campo, Gary Speed and Kevin Nolan had control, energy and goals, while a front three of Stelios Giannakopoulos, El-Hadji Diouf and Nicolas Anelka contained pace, guile, skill and one genuine world-class striker.</p> <p>Bolton were third at the start of 2007 but their small squad became overwhelmed. An extra-time defeat at home to Arsenal in the fifth round of the FA Cup was deflating, they won four league games after Christmas and Allardyce, unable to take them any further, resigned two games before the end of the season. Bolton still finished seventh and qualified for the Uefa Cup, but it was the end of an era.</p> <p>Allardyce does not wish to repeat that experience. He has led West Ham to their highest position at Christmas since 1985 and, although he is not foolish enough to say they will still be there in May, he believes that the difference now is the depth of his squad.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think what disappointed me at Bolton \xe2\x80\x93 not that I\xe2\x80\x99m saying this is going to happen this time \xe2\x80\x93 was my squad was short in depth and it had done as much as it could to get in the top three,\xe2\x80\x9d Allardyce said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn fact, on 1 January we were third in the league with 39 points and it was then that I went to strengthen that squad and wasn\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to, which was the biggest disappointment probably of my management career. Being sacked, that\xe2\x80\x99s a disappointment, but to think that we were there \xe2\x80\xa6</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis scenario, I think the squad we\xe2\x80\x99ve got now, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be very difficult with the players that are going to be available in January to make it better. Our strength in depth is far greater than the Bolton squad then, which Kevin was in, playing absolutely brilliantly at that particular time with Nicolas Anelka.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere were two times in that period in the first 20 games where we won five games on the trot. The last five games on the trot was over the Christmas period. I knew the squad was tiring and I wanted to add to it. This one, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think needs to be added to, unless it\xe2\x80\x99s a top, top player.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>One top, top player Allardyce has brought to Upton Park is Alex Song and what a boost for West Ham that they will have the midfielder available in January after he was left out of Cameroon\xe2\x80\x99s squad for the Africa Cup of Nations. Song, as Allardyce says, makes them sing and his contest with his former Barcelona team-mate Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas will be fascinating against Chelsea; he will also relish facing Arsenal, one of his former clubs, when they visit Upton Park on Sunday.</p> <p>Allardyce told an entertaining story about seeing Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho punch the air at a Soccer Aid match when Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s manager realised he had convinced F\xc3\xa0bregas to sign for the club. Allardyce had a similar feeling when Song decided to join West Ham on loan from Barcelona. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was under the radar,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt took a while for you boys to twig on, which was very unusual. It fended off any other possible takers for Alex. I was absolutely delighted.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was a miracle, based on what normally filters out in football today. But eventually it did. We fended off one big club in Turkey. He\xe2\x80\x99s never rushed and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s the measure of a quality player.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>West Ham would love Song to sign permanently. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got ambition,\xe2\x80\x9d Allardyce said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he likes it, he might want to stay.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
