b'THE BANTAMS\xe2\x80\x99 MENACE <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the good thing about playing consecutive matches without many days in between,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho after his Chelsea side had let slip a two-goal lead to lose 4-2 at home to Bradford City, his attention turning already to tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s Carling Cup semi-final, second leg against Liverpool. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the good thing that, when you lose, you have to focus immediately on the next game.\xe2\x80\x9d Probably the only good thing to come out of that game then, Jos\xc3\xa9.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe respected them \xe2\x80\x93 or at least I respected them \xe2\x80\x93 in the way we prepared the game,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho insisted. And therein perhaps lay the problem. At their best this season Chelsea have romped forward without a care in the world, treating their opponents as no more than a minor inconvenience, something that can perhaps slow them down but has no chance whatsoever of stopping them completely. At their best, Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with opponents is like a skydiver\xe2\x80\x99s with a parachute: not to be treated with contempt, exactly \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s fairly important, for things to go well, that it exists \xe2\x80\x93 but when it comes to it there\xe2\x80\x99s zero chance of it stopping them getting where they\xe2\x80\x99re going. It would have been interesting to see what the score might have been had Chelsea not respected them; had they treated Bradford with complete contempt.</p> <p>The only contemptuous dismissal The Fiver has found from Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s match at Stamford Bridge came before kick-off: \xe2\x80\x9cI came out of the tunnel and he started screaming my name,\xe2\x80\x9d reported one player, after a member of the other team\xe2\x80\x99s staff accosted him on the pitch. \xe2\x80\x9cI was trying to get in the zone and didn\xe2\x80\x99t know where to look. It was a bit awkward.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s not one of Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s stars shrugging off the attention of a giddy League One fanboy, though, it\xe2\x80\x99s Chelsea-reject-turned-goalscoring-Bantam Felipe Morais talking about Mourinho.</p> <p>But the teams that had the most humbling weekend were those at the BBC and BT Sport. Given a full draw to choose from, the FA\xe2\x80\x99s partner broadcasters gave the good ones a miss and, with four of the five televised games now completed, can so far boast two goalless draws and three victories by the favourites. There was a grand total of one goal in the BBC\xe2\x80\x99s two big games, while the red-card-and-goal-jamboree that was Blackeye Rovers v Swansea was only considered worthy of being shown to Welsh people.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the most exciting avalanche of Cup football in living memory was played out at 3pm on a Saturday afternoon. At the time, the Beeb was treating the nation to obscure Italian 1960s war thriller Suicide Commandos, in which a low-budget group of guerilla fighters attempted to sabotage the theoretically-impregnable compound of a considerably more advanced and lavishly-resourced army. It\xe2\x80\x99s a shame the Fiver was too busy enjoying the football to see it, because in many ways the plot sounds rather promising. And also a little familiar \xe2\x80\xa6</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Alan Smith at 6pm GMT for DR Congo 1-1 Tunisia and Cape Verde 1-0 Zambia, and then keep John Ashdown company for Rochdale 1-2 Stoke City at 8pm, shortly after he\xe2\x80\x99s been on top of the FA Cup fifth-round draw at 7.20pm \xe2\x80\x93 any excuse to liveblog The One Show.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>September 2006: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was an easy decision to make. My family comes before the football\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Juan Rom\xc3\xa1n Riquelme retires from international football.</p> <p>March 2009: \xe2\x80\x9cIt hurts me in my soul to do this, but hopefully everything will turn out well for the team and they can qualify for the World Cup without me\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Riquelme quits international football. Again.</p> <p>July 2012: \xe2\x80\x9cIf my friends want to see me and discuss where I will play next, I will do so on my games console but I cannot play any more. Like I said, I am empty and I have nothing more to give \xe2\x80\xa6 Now I just want to go home, have a barbecue with my friends, see my children and greet them\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Riquelme retires from football to spend more time with his grill.</p> <p>Today: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s clear now that I\xe2\x80\x99ll be on holiday, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have fun, enjoy time with my children. From now on my football life ends and a new life starts. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see what it holds\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Riquelme calls time on the game once more. The Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s got a pretty good guess what life holds.</p>      FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDoes anyone at Fiver Towers have a contact address for Luis Enrique at Barcelona? I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve stumbled across the magic formula he mentioned for scoring goals. Unfortunately, as this refers to 1967-68 season, he will also need to sell Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez and buy George Best, Bobby Charlton and Rodney Marsh (according to my personal football sticker collection) hint \xe2\x80\xa6 hint \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Dave Gill.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf The Fiver is now doing versions of MTV shows (Friday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters), shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it pay a visit to Xzibit? \xe2\x80\x98Yo dawg, I heard you like jokes in your email, so I put jokes in your email.\xe2\x80\x99 1,057 readers might think this a good idea\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Richard Winchell.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

The midfielder, who used to play for Standard, lost his head on the field instead, booting the ball at fans and getting sent off, as his team lost 2-0.</p>      <p>Fabian Delph says his Aston Villa team-mates were shocked when he signed a new deal with the club. Them and us both. \xe2\x80\x9cIt says a lot about him,\xe2\x80\x9d parped chief suit Tom Fox.</p> <p>Mario Balotelli\xe2\x80\x99s Liverpool career is not over, according to Brendan Rodgers. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will give Mario every chance,\xe2\x80\x9d he promised of a player he last offered a starting chance to in November.</p> <p>Cambridge United suit Dave Doggett says the cash earned from their FA Cup replay at Manchester United will be spent on much needed upgrades to their ground. \xe2\x80\x9cHopefully we can get the stadium done and start putting in some proper toilets,\xe2\x80\x9d he whimpered, crossing his legs.</p> <p>Didier Drogba wants to remain part of the Chelsea family past the end of this season. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have achieved so much and won so many trophies like we have done in the past 10 years, that creates something special,\xe2\x80\x9d crooned the forward.</p> <p>Like some kind of footballing Don Draper, Pep Guardiola is in no rush to sign a contract tying him to Bayern Munich. \xe2\x80\x9cHe does not need a five-year deal to know how much he earns at Bayern,\xe2\x80\x9d parped chief suit Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, who presumably does know how much he earns.</p> <p>And Gennaro Gattuso, the man who once walked out on OFI Crete before walking back in on them a day later and then walking out again just over a month later, believes he is the man to bring stability to the Pope\xe2\x80\x99s Newc O\xe2\x80\x99Rangers.</p> STILL WANT MORE? <p>David Squires is a boss.
