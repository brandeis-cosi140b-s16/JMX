b'Everton 2-2 Leicester City | Premier League match report'


b'<p>Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez used his programme notes to accuse Chelsea of \xe2\x80\x9ctrying to influence the referee\xe2\x80\x9d during Everton\xe2\x80\x99s recent defeat at Stamford Bridge but his problems lie much closer to home. Leicester City, who are bottom of the table, became the 10th of 13 visitors to leave Goodison Park with at least a point in the Premier League this season and would have departed with a precious away win but for an 88th-minute own goal. No wonder Everton have frozen next year\xe2\x80\x99s season-ticket prices.</p> <p>Tim Howard was at fault for both Leicester goals as two of the substitutes, Jamie Vardy and David Nugent, injected potency and creativity into the visiting display, while Romelu Lukaku squandered a host of clear-cut chances before forcing the unfortunate Matthew Upson to put through his own net two minutes from time. Mart\xc3\xadnez absolved Howard of blame for the result and claimed \xe2\x80\x9cthe fear of having something to lose\xe2\x80\x9d was responsible for Everton\xe2\x80\x99s lack of composure in defence. In keeping with his decision to recall Howard at the expense of Joel Robles, once the veteran keeper had recovered from a calf injury, the argument did not stack up.</p> <p>For Leicester, what may yet prove a valuable point in their fight to avoid relegation seemed like a cause for despair on the final whistle. Nigel Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s team carried the greater threat throughout, only not in sufficient numbers until the manager\xe2\x80\x99s double substitution paid immediate dividends. They heightened Goodison\xe2\x80\x99s understandable anxiety with two swift goals to take the lead with 20 minutes to go, both created by Vardy and involving Howard errors, but were pegged back when Lukaku threw himself at Christian Atsu\xe2\x80\x99s cross and his diving header deflected in off Upson.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe dressing room is very disappointed because we did very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pearson. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have got to turn these sorts of performances into wins. I thought we played well, we showed a lot of discipline, understanding of the system and both of their goals had an element of raising your eyebrows \xe2\x80\x93 a scuffed shot going through your legs and the last touch coming off Matty. But there is no point in talking about being unlucky. If we apply ourselves in the way we did today and at Arsenal, I think we will be fine.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mart\xc3\xadnez cited tiredness as a factor in Everton\xe2\x80\x99s laboured display and for Lukaku\xe2\x80\x99s profligacy following Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s 4-1 win at Young Boys in the Europa League. His team have won only two of seven league games following European exertions but results have been no better without the added demands of the competition.</p> <p>The distraction excuse does not apply. If anything, the Europa League should have enhanced Everton\xe2\x80\x99s self-belief given their best performances of the season have come against Wolfsburg, Lille and in Berne. But convincing, clinical victories in Europe are not being replicated domestically. This was another league display lacking intensity and ingenuity from Everton, at least until the introduction of Atsu and the impressive Darron Gibson, and it is now six consecutive home games without a win.</p> <p>Jeff Schlupp should have put Leicester ahead at the start of the second half (there was nothing to report from the first) when Howard parried Matty James\xe2\x80\x99s shot into his path but the Ghana international shot wide. The goalkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s reprieve would be short-lived.</p> <p>Mart\xc3\xadnez withdrew the anonymous Ross Barkley to polite applause and the industrious Muhamed Besic to widespread boos but the complaints ceased when Lukaku released Steven Naismith inside the area. The Scot cut inside Wes Morgan and squeezed a shot between the Leicester captain and Robert Huth that trickled inside the near post with Mark Schwarzer stranded. Leicester had a penalty claim for a handball by Seamus Coleman dismissed seconds earlier. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has hit his hand but it would have been harsh,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Pearson.</p> <p>Leicester responded vibrantly. Vardy broke clear of James McCarthy far too easily down the right and drilled in a low cross that Howard pushed into the path of Nugent via a slight touch off John Stones. The boyhood Evertonian duly converted from three yards and kept his celebrations in check. Moments later, after Lukaku had shot over when put clear by McCarthy, Howard flapped at Danny Simpson\xe2\x80\x99s deep cross and Vardy returned the loose ball for Esteban Cambiasso to fire beyond the struggling keeper.</p> <p>Everton were staring at a damaging defeat when Lukaku, having missed another good chance from Naismith\xe2\x80\x99s pass, made amends by forcing an unfortunate own goal from the Leicester central defender.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Tim [Howard] is fully fit he is a very strong performer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mart\xc3\xadnez. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we conceded the goals because we had a fear of conceding rather than a player making the wrong decision. As a team we need to defend much better in those situations. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see Tim as directly responsible for the draw.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Man of the match Jamie Vardy</p> <p>(Leicester City)</p>'
