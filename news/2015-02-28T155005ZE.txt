b'European results expose the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s true level | Paul Wilson'


b'<p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger was unusually severe in his criticism of Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s shortcomings in the wake of the 3-1 humbling by Monaco, though it was a French coach still living and working in France who provided the pithiest assessment of a bad week for Premier League teams in Europe.</p> <p>Ren\xc3\xa9 Girard is coach of Lille, mid\xe2\x80\x91table in Ligue 1 and not even involved in any European action this past week, and from the sound of it he has had enough of exaggerated claims about the quality of football across the Channel. \xe2\x80\x9cTo those who say our league is shit, it proves there\xe2\x80\x99s perhaps shit elsewhere as well,\xe2\x80\x9d Girard said of Monaco\xe2\x80\x99s result, and that was before Liverpool and Tottenham made their Europa League exits.</p> <p>Is the Premier League really that bad? Most people are reasonably happy with what they see and the television money pouring in suggests overseas markets lap up the product as well, though for several years now, since the high points of English teams reaching the Champions League final five years in succession a decade ago and providing half the last eight in 2008 and 2009, European competition has shown that the richest league in the world does not produce the strongest teams.</p> <p>It does not require much imagination to understand that other leagues are resentful of the wealth of English clubs, especially if it is perceived to be undeserved, if the now prodigious income is being channelled into a demonstrably inferior product.</p> <p>Even people in this country seem to love the idea of the so-called greatest league in the world being exposed as second-rate, except that it is never the easiest task to find out who does bill the Premier League so grandly. For the money they spend Sky are probably entitled to make immodest boasts, though beyond the sales pitch the situation is a little more complicated.</p> <p>No one with any sense would dispute that the best teams in the world can usually be found in La Liga, or that when it comes to producing and retaining home-grown talent Germany and Spain are out on their own. The unique selling point England can offer is a more competitive league, a domestic programme where games are often eventful and results unpredictable. While one only has to watch Match of the Day most weeks to know that this is a successful and entertaining formula, the possibility has long existed that English football is as insular as geography would suggest, operating convincingly within its own vacuum but withering on contact with the outside world.</p> <p>Certainly since the post-Heysel ban English clubs have generally been playing catch-up in Europe, and what appeared progress a few years ago was more a case of two disparate threads coming together. One was the empire Sir Alex Ferguson built, after taking years to come to terms with European football Manchester United finally found the right blueprint and stuck with it, even if it never did run to matching Barcelona. The other was the importation of continental coaches and methods, with Wenger showing the way but Rafa Ben\xc3\xadtez and Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho quickly making a mark.</p> <p>Superficially, much of the non\xe2\x80\x91performance in Europe this year can be put down to the demise of United. That is one of the Premier League major players out of the equation, and while Manchester City have made enormous strides on the domestic front their European progress has been painfully slow.</p> <p>Arsenal have been standing still for some time, despite cosmetic adornments in Mesut \xc3\x96zil and Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez, while Liverpool and Spurs appear to be suffering from the same sort of stagefright that afflicts City in Europe. A word of praise is due for Everton, still flying the flag in the Europa League and now faced with difficult opponents in Kiev, but it is no coincidence that Chelsea, with Mourinho back at the helm, look likely to go furthest in Europe.</p> <p>Chelsea do not produce their own players, none of the leading clubs in England do, though Mourinho is a great team builder and transfer market operator with a proven record against high-calibre opponents. In the rest of the English game, that is not true any more. Arsenal have lost any edge they once had, even Manuel Pellegrini admits City still keep making the same mistakes, while United have spent \xc2\xa3150m and are still in the wilderness.</p> <p>There is, it has to be admitted, an impermanence to English football that its riches cannot mask, if indeed the huge amounts of easy money are not actually contributing to the problem. Why should Manchester United, one of the most successful clubs in the world in recent years, require a period of grace to get over a change of manager?</p> <p>For the same reason, presumably, that Arsenal tolerate slow decline under Wenger for fear of what might come next. Money is around to patch up most problems so there is never a need to look too far below the surface and worry about sustainability or self-sufficiency, just as it is convenient to ignore the reality that expensive acquisitions such as \xc3\x96zil and S\xc3\xa1nchez, not to mention Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas and \xc3\x81ngel di Mar\xc3\xada, were all deemed surplus to requirements by their previous Spanish clubs.</p> <p>If the rest of Europe sees the Premier League as part cash cow, part retirement home for overpaid cast-offs, it is difficult to mount a defence. Not when the last significant homegrown contribution was the Class of 92 and the only prize for attacking ingenuity since Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s Arsenal peaked would have gone to Liverpool, all too briefly, around this time last season.</p> <p>English teams take a lot out of each other when they meet in domestic fixtures. It is the basic honesty of the competition that is admired around the world and the Premier League could well be the hardest one to win. For that reason alone it seems fair that England stands second (above Germany and Italy) in Uefa\xe2\x80\x99s coefficient ranking, even if the table is based on form in Europe and further poor results could eventually see the Champions League quota cut from four clubs to three.</p> <p>While there is no immediate danger of that, warning lights are flashing. English clubs have more than enough money to invest in their own future, it is about time they came up with something more substantial.</p>'
