b'Fernando Torres welcomed back to Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid by 40,000 fans'


b'<p>\xe2\x80\x9cEver since 24 July 2007 we have all been waiting for this moment,\xe2\x80\x9d the Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid president, Enrique Cerezo, said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not just any day. This is a very important day: Fernando Torres has come home.\xe2\x80\x9d Torres sat a few metres away in the front row of the directors\xe2\x80\x99 box at the Vicente Calder\xc3\xb3n while through the glass doors the stands filled.</p> <p>By the time Torres stepped outside and on to the pitch, wearing No19, there were 40,000 inside the groundVicente Calder\xc3\xb3n. They were loud too.</p> <p>24 July 2007 was the day Torres left Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid for Liverpool before moving to Chelsea for a record \xc2\xa350m fee.</p> <p>This summer he joined Milan on loan but it did not last long: 10 games and one goal later he departed. Seven and a half years after leaving home he is back.</p>              <p>\xe2\x80\x9cA lot has happened since thenI always hoped that [leaving Atl\xc3\xa9tico] was a \xe2\x80\x98see you later\xe2\x80\x99 not a \xe2\x80\x98goodbye\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d Torres said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was not really a concrete moment [when a return became an option]. It was more a process.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI have been in contact with the club all these years and when we saw it could happen and everyone agreed it was not difficult.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was a 24-year-old kid. It was very hard [to leave], the hardest decision of my career. I left to help the club grow and time has proved it to be right.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe club has improved in every way and I have won the titles I was looking for. \xe2\x80\x9c[Atl\xc3\xa9tico] is a very different club now. There is less doubt than there was and they are competing with Barcelona and Madrid, with fewer resources. I want to win titles here now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>That is the challenge, of course. Sitting before Torres were players from the club\xe2\x80\x99s youth system, 11-year-olds who finished runners-up in one of Spain\xe2\x80\x99s most prestigious tournaments this Christmas. They then joined Torres for photographs and Cerezo described the 30-year-old \xe2\x80\x93 still known as El Ni\xc3\xb1o, a youth-team product and a fan \xe2\x80\x93 as a symbol and an example for other kids at the club.</p> <p>The warmth of his welcome was overwhelming; Torres is an icon here. Expectations are high, too, but the coach, Diego Simeone, said: \xe2\x80\x9cTorres does not come as a saviour.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The striker does not expect even to come as a starter; the manager has talked about him offering variety, a different type of attacking threat and about the fact he will have to compete to get a place.</p> <p>His debut may come on Wednesday in the Copa del Rey \xe2\x80\x93 against the club\xe2\x80\x99s city rivals Real Madrid. \xe2\x80\x9cI know that there will be responsibility but I am here to contribute what I can, to add to the team.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI hope to learn quickly and play when they need me. Thank you for giving me this opportunity,\xe2\x80\x9d Torres said before heading off to change. Outside, they were still waiting.</p> <p>When he emerged at the top of the tunnel wearing red and white the roar was immense. He was joined by his children, Nora and Leo.</p> <p>Songs ran round and so did he, signing and kicking balls into the crowd. And then, just before 2pm, there was a huge cheer as Torres put the ball in the net at the north end of the Calder\xc3\xb3n. Nora Torres, that is.</p>'
