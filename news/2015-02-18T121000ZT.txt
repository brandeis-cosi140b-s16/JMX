b'Thibaut Courtois is in a different class, says Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s John Terry'


b'<p>John Terry has hailed Thibaut Courtois\xe2\x80\x99 impact in the Chelsea first-team this season while heaping praise upon the club\xe2\x80\x99s long-standing No1, Petr Cech, for his professionalism after seeing his place in the side usurped.</p> <p>Courtois was outstanding at Parc des Princes on Tuesday night as the Premier League leaders secured a potentially valuable 1-1 draw at Paris Saint-Germain in the first leg of their Champions League knockout tie. The young Belgian, who had spent the previous three seasons on loan at Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid, had been rested for last week\xe2\x80\x99s victory over Everton when Cech had produced two eye-catching saves to deny Romelu Lukaku and help maintain the side\xe2\x80\x99s seven point advantage at the top of the division.</p> <p>Yet Cech returned to the bench in Paris, with Courtois reserving his best block to deny Zlatan Ibrahimovic\xe2\x80\x99s header in stoppage time at the end. \xe2\x80\x9cCourtois is different class,\xe2\x80\x9d said Terry. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw enough of him in the semi-finals last season [when Atl\xc3\xa9tico knocked Chelsea out 3-1 on aggregate]. It\xe2\x80\x99s unlucky for Big Pete because he made two unbelievable saves from Lukaku against Everton, but he has been unbelievably professional around the club this season. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a lot of players in my time throw their toys out of the pram but he\xe2\x80\x99s been different class for the team, and that\xe2\x80\x99s been important.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho faces an awkward decision next month when he chooses his lineup for the Capital One Cup final against Tottenham Hotspur. Cech played in the early rounds of the competition, only for Courtois to feature in both legs of the semi-final against Liverpool as the London club prevailed 2-1 on aggregate.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe manager stresses the importance of the team coming first,\xe2\x80\x9d said Terry. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re both there for the whole squad. Both of them have been excellent. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got the two best goalkeepers in the world, in my opinion, both fighting for one place, so it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult. You can\xe2\x80\x99t keep them both happy. The manager manages to do it, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how. Obviously they both want to play all the time, but the two of them are at the top of their games. Rotating them is a tough job. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather that was the manager\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Asked whether he thought Cech would seek to move at the end of the season, ending what would be an 11-year career at Stamford Bridge, the captain added: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve not even spoken and credit to Pete: he\xe2\x80\x99s not grumbled or sent shockwaves through the dressing room. He\xe2\x80\x99s been really professional. He knows he\xe2\x80\x99s been a top keeper and still has a lot to give. He\xe2\x80\x99s fighting for his place. He hasn\xe2\x80\x99t just given up and said: \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s yours, Thibaut\xe2\x80\x99. When he\xe2\x80\x99s come in he\xe2\x80\x99s been brilliant and given the manager food for thought. He could play for anyone, and he\xe2\x80\x99s been different class for us. He\xe2\x80\x99s been worth 10-12 points every season.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s goal in Paris was scored by Branislav Ivanovic, the right-back nodding in after Terry\xe2\x80\x99s cross was flicked on by Gary Cahill. The Serb has scored critical winners against Liverpool and Aston Villa in recent weeks, and now boasts more goals \xe2\x80\x93 seven \xe2\x80\x93 than any other defender in the Champions League over the last six years. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has scored some important goals for us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Terry.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLook at the Liverpool one a couple of weeks ago. He pops up in the final of the Europa League [in 2013], too. He really is a top player for the team. It\xe2\x80\x99s a desire and hunger he\xe2\x80\x99s got, and the aggression and strength to want to get in those positions and out-strength the opponent.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe was one of the lads who hadn\xe2\x80\x99t trained since Everton. There have been a few of them. One or two turned out for the cameras [on Monday]. That\xe2\x80\x99s what it\xe2\x80\x99s about at this time of year, players digging deep. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been lucky until now with injuries and niggles but everyone got through the game okay and we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a bit of time after the Burnley game, but first we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a massive three points to get at the weekend.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWith us playing Spurs the following weekend in the final, that\xe2\x80\x99ll be an opportunity for Manchester City to close the gap, so it\xe2\x80\x99s really important that we pick up points against Burnley. They\xe2\x80\x99ve shown away to City that they\xe2\x80\x99re fighting. Where we are and they are in the table means nothing. We\xe2\x80\x99ll certainly be up for it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
