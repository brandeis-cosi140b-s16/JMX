b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho tells Chelsea they must not dwell on shock Bradford loss'


b'<p>Like many men of a certain age, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do birthdays any more. What is there to celebrate when you have just ticked off another year towards your pension?</p> <p>And, anyway, what is there to celebrate when you have just become a laughing stock? When your team have been dumped out of the FA Cup by a bunch of supposed no-hopers in an upset of seismic proportions.</p> <p>Mourinho, 52 on Monday, is likely to produce one of his best \xe2\x80\x9cMr Grumpy\xe2\x80\x9d impressions \xe2\x80\x93 of which there have been many lately \xe2\x80\x93 should he be asked to blow out any candles. If, that is, anyone is brave enough to buy him a cake. \xe2\x80\x9cI stopped celebrating birthdays at the age of 42,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. So that\xe2\x80\x99s it, then. Today is just a normal day in the life of Jos\xc3\xa9.</p> <p>As it was on Sunday, when the Portuguese arrived early at Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s training ground in Surrey to greet his players with, no doubt, a few choice observations on their miserable FA Cup exit against League One Bradford City. Saturday evening was not the time for him to berate his players face to face, though he had spoken publicly of his shame at his side\xe2\x80\x99s display \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a disgrace, it\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptable\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 during his post-match press conference.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I did not say that to the players,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said. \xe2\x80\x9cI said nothing, not a word. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a moment to speak to them. That\xe2\x80\x99s for tomorrow [Sunday]. Nothing to do now. I go home, I have dinner and at 8 o\xe2\x80\x99clock [on Sunday], I am in the training ground.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It was probably a chastening experience for the players at Cobham yesterday, after throwing away a 2-0 lead against Bradford. For them to then collapse was, indeed, unacceptable.</p> <p>Only three regulars \xe2\x80\x93 Oscar, Gary Cahill and C\xc3\xa9sar Azpilicueta \xe2\x80\x93 started the fourth-round contest. But even when Mourinho brought on major reinforcements in Willian, Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas and Eden Hazard there was little discernible difference. \xe2\x80\x9cAt half-time it was 2-1 and we spoke about the danger of the situation,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the players thought: \xe2\x80\x98We are going to score, not them.\xe2\x80\x99 And when Bradford scored for 2-2, after that, the game became crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>From a huge fall \xe2\x80\x93 and Mourinho graciously congratulated the Bradford players in their dressing-room afterwards \xe2\x80\x93 at least Chelsea can get back on the horse swiftly. They meet Liverpool in the second leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night, with the tie level at 1-1. \xe2\x80\x9cThe good thing about playing consecutive matches without many days in between,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said, \xe2\x80\x9cis that when you lose, you have to focus immediately on the next game. There\xe2\x80\x99s not a lot of time to be moaning or analysing the bad one. So let\xe2\x80\x99s move to the next game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Were the Chelsea fans moaning? Not really, such was their stunned disbelief. Yet it had all been so comfortable when goals from Cahill and Ramires had effectively pushed the cruise-control button.</p> <p>Even when Jon Stead, Bradford\xe2\x80\x99s standout performer, lashed home for Bradford shortly before half-time, there was a sense of \xe2\x80\x9cso what?\xe2\x80\x9d about the Bridge \xe2\x80\xa6 until that hazy, crazy last quarter of an hour and seven minutes\xe2\x80\x99 stoppage time.</p> <p>The former Chelsea winger Filipe Morais equalised, Andy Halliday made it 3-2 and the substitute Mark Yeates completed the humiliation. The 6,000 Bradford fans at the Shed end, where those three goals were scored, went bonkers.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWith our supporters, the second half was like a home game for us,\xe2\x80\x9d Phil Parkinson, the Bradford manager, said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was crucial and, even at 2-0 down, they stayed right with us.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cKicking towards our fans after half-time we set out to have a real go at Chelsea. We\xe2\x80\x99re at our best when we play in a positive fashion. It was all about respecting Chelsea but not fearing them. That was our mantra.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Respect, not fear. Much the same as in the 2012-13 season when Bradford defeated Wigan Athletic, Arsenal and Aston Villa of the Premier League on their way to the Capital One Cup final, in which they lost 5-0 to Swansea City.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got five or six players who went through that cup run with us and had that great experience,\xe2\x80\x9d Parkinson said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, this group are rewriting the history books again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea can still rewrite history. The quadruple may be gone but the treble of League Cup, Premier League and Champions League is still on.</p> <p>Few may go near Mourinho today. He will still be smouldering. But let\xe2\x80\x99s say it, anyway. Happy birthday, Jos\xc3\xa9.</p> <p>Man of the match Jon Stead (Bradford)</p>'
