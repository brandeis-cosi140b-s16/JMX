b'Southampton 1-1 Ipswich Town | FA Cup third round match report'


b'<p>If matches were decided on the basis of possession and territorial dominance alone, then Southampton would already be in the fourth round of the FA Cup.</p> <p>Ronald Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s side spent almost the entirety of the second half camped outside Ipswich Town\xe2\x80\x99s area as they searched for a winning goal, pinning back the side from the Championship and forcing them to defend with absolute concentration. It was possible to count on one hand the number of times Mick McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s men crossed the halfway line. Ipswich were often defending from their own six-yard box against opponents who are fourth in the Premier League.</p> <p>Southampton, however, were met with a blue wall of defiance and they will not relish the prospect of a replay at Portman Road next Wednesday, especially as it falls in between trips to Manchester United and Newcastle in the league. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to play the replay and that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t what I expected,\xe2\x80\x9d Koeman said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t make a lot of changes and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to make a lot of changes.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhat happens next week I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. We have to play three away games, difficult ones, so we will see what happens.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>McCarthy had his tongue firmly lodged in his cheek when he joked about telling his players off for adding another game to their heavy schedule. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose, that\xe2\x80\x99s for sure,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t we have a cup run as well?\xe2\x80\x9d Ipswich\xe2\x80\x99s primary focus is on promotion and McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s decision to make six changes to the side that beat Charlton Athletic 3-0 last Tuesday raised fears the FA Cup was being treated as an afterthought.</p> <p>Yet Ipswich, who were given tremendous backing from the packed away end, are second in the Championship for a reason, while Southampton were unnerved by the way they were hassled into making cheap errors in the early stages and hardly resembled the side that took Arsenal apart with such precision on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day.</p> <p>Koeman put Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s sloppiness in the first 20 minutes down to a lack of focus and Ipswich capitalised, taking the lead when Darren Ambrose scored with a wonderful header in the 19th minute.</p> <p>With Nathaniel Clyne out with an ankle injury and Toby Alderweireld only on the bench because of a hamstring problem, James Ward-Prowse was a makeshift right-back for Southampton and he was exposed when Tyrone Mings, reportedly a target for Arsenal and Chelsea, found space on the left and hung a deep cross to the far post. Ambrose had a lot to do but the 30-year-old, making his first start for Ipswich since rejoining them in September, generated enough power on his header to send it beyond the reach of Fraser Forster.</p> <p>The frustration for Ipswich was that all their good work was undone by the moment of indecision that culminated in Morgan Schneiderlin\xe2\x80\x99s equaliser 12 minutes before half-time. Christophe Berra failed to deal with a Graziano Pell\xc3\xa8 knock-down from a Ward-Prowse cross and Schneiderlin lobbed Dean Gerken from close range. It was a desperately poor goal to concede and allowed Southampton to settle. Gerken pushed Ward-Prowse\xe2\x80\x99s free-kick away and Southampton appealed for a penalty when Mings fouled Shane Long. A free-kick was awarded instead but Koeman, who said that Sadio Man\xc3\xa9 will not go to the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal because of a calf injury, thought the offence took place inside the area.</p> <p>Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s superiority forced Ipswich to take a step back and it was a forlorn task for David McGoldrick on his own up front once McCarthy had moved his strike partner, Daryl Murphy, to the right of midfield. Ipswich\xe2\x80\x99s adventurous approach from the first half was more or less extinguished. This was a team effort, however, and ultimately there were not many heart-in-mouth moments for them to endure as the minutes ticked away.</p> <p>Man of the match Tommy Smith (Ipswich Town)</p>'
