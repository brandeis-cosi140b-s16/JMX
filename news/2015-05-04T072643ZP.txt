b'Premier League: 10 talking points from this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s action'


b"1) Cuadrado\xe2\x80\x99s travails show Mourinho must strengthen up top <p>If Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s victory at home to Crystal Palace always had the feel of an agreeably slow-burn afternoon league title party, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know what to make of Juan Cuadrado\xe2\x80\x99s role in the festivities. Cuadrado made just his second start for Chelsea, played on his favoured right flank in front of the marauding Branislav Ivanovic, but still ended up being ushered into the hallway, given a piece of cake in a napkin and bundled off into a taxi at half-time. It has been noted that Chelsea had six defenders and two defensive midfielders on the pitch at the end of their 1-0 win. More interesting, perhaps, is the fact this was also a split team, with an entire back four and goalkeeper from the pre- or inter-Mourinho years, and a front six with five Mourinho Mk2 signings. Cuadrado is the most recent of these, the most obviously disappointing, and perhaps also the clearest indication of where Mourinho might strengthen from here. The Colombian didn\xe2\x80\x99t just look low on confidence at Stamford Bridge, he looked like a man playing through a translator. Whether he has hardly played because he scarcely fits the system, or whether he scarcely fits the system because he has hardly played is open for debate, but either way Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa327m winter signing has been bafflingly low-impact, scoring no goals, creating no goals and having just three shots on target in 259 minutes of football since signing in February. Mourinho \xe2\x80\x93 who likes his attacking midfielders in the Willian mould: robust, compact, not that attacking \xe2\x80\x93 can luxuriate in another title win. But if Chelsea are to present more of a threat to the better teams in the Champions League, or indeed to see off stronger domestic challenges next year, the front end of the team will at some point have to take a little of the creative, penetrative burden off Eden Hazard. A settled, more confident Cuadrado (or equivalent) would be an excellent addition.

What followed, after Pellegrini had been asked how he felt about being 13 points behind Chelsea, strengthened the theory. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not thinking about the gap,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini said. \xe2\x80\x9cChelsea did exactly what we did last season, winning the Premier League and the Capital One Cup. We did it by scoring more goals and by playing in a different style.\xe2\x80\x9d So was it important to play attractive, attacking football? \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s important for the Premier League and for the fans to play attractive football,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I have said what I just said. We won [last season] playing another style. We scored 156 goals and 102 of them in the Premier League. And we continue to be the top scorers [in the league this season].\xe2\x80\x9d Sadly for Pellegrini, it has not been enough. David Hytner </p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Tottenham Hotspur 0-1 Manchester City  \xe2\x80\xa2 Pellegrini warns Mourinho it will be tough to retain title  3) Should Carver button his lip? <p>Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s remaining fixtures do not look especially daunting \xe2\x80\x93 they have to play West Bromwich Albion, a QPR team who will probably have been relegated already, and West Ham. The problem is, no team looks easier to play against at the moment than Newcastle, who are unravelling spectacularly while those below them rally. What can they possibly change between now and their next match? Not their squad, nor their injuries and suspensions. Tactics, yes. How about their attitude? Maybe, but you suspect that the inspiration for that adjustment will have to come from the urgency of their plight rather than from the manager, whose frustration at his inability to uplift his players is all too obvious.</p> <p>It is difficult to imagine that panning the squad (all except Jack Colback, which was harsh on the couple of other players who did perform well on Saturday, notably Ayoze P\xc3\xa9rez) and accusing Mike Williamson of looking for a red card, as John Carver did after defeat to Leicester, will make the players any more attentive to his instructions. Carver said he spent most of last week preparing his side to cope with a strong start from Leicester \xe2\x80\x93 they then conceded after 34 seconds; the manager said he was then \xe2\x80\x9cmore animated that I have ever been in my life\xe2\x80\x9d at half-time, and his team went 3-0 down straight after the break. Some things are too blatant to be denied: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99m honest, I have to admit there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance they\xe2\x80\x99re just not listening to me. That might be one factor of many, and you have to consider it. You have to consider it and take it into account. But it might be a lot of other things \xe2\x80\x93 we might not be good enough, we might not have enough desire to want to defend in the box or score at the other end. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of factors, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t deny that [the players not listening] could be one of them. All I will say is that the responses I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen on the training ground don\xe2\x80\x99t suggest that. I know it\xe2\x80\x99s different playing matches to playing on the training ground, and I want match footballers not training-ground footballers. But I see how those players are playing for me on the training ground and going into the game, and I\xe2\x80\x99m happy. But then they keep shooting themselves in the foot.\xe2\x80\x9d Does Carver shooting so liberally from the hip help? Paul Doyle</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Leicester City 3-0 Newcastle  \xe2\x80\xa2 Carver accuses Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s Williamson of deliberate red card  \xe2\x80\xa2 Williamson apologises for red card but denies dismissal was deliberate            Nigel Pearson apologises for calling journalist an ostrich \xe2\x80\x93 video    4) Who will take penalties for Manchester United? <p>Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s worrying run of failure in front of goal has not been helped by a 50% failure rate from the penalty spot in league games this season. Robin van Persie, who saw his effort against West Brom well saved by Boaz Myhill, and Wayne Rooney have each taken two spot-kicks this season and each scored one of them. Given Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s career Premier League penalty conversion rate is the third lowest ever among players to have taken at least 20 penalties \xe2\x80\x93 18 of 26 for a 69% success rate \xe2\x80\x93 Louis van Gaal is in no mood to replace the faltering Van Persie with the England centre-forward. But, tellingly, Van Gaal declined to reveal who his penalty taker will be immediately after the Albion defeat, save to say that it most definitely will not be Van Persie or Rooney. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, he is now at the end of the road, it is always like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Van Gaal of his fellow Dutchman. \xe2\x80\x9cWayne has missed also so when you miss you are at the bottom again.\xe2\x80\x9d Interestingly, even though Manchester United hardly enjoyed a season to remember in 2013-14, their success from the spot was impressive, with David Moyes\xe2\x80\x99 team converting all five of their attempts through Rooney (3) and Van Persie (2). And the two players with worse United career penalty rates than Rooney? Michael Owen (67%) and Teddy Sheringham (68%).

It will probably only be when he is gone that people will recognise what a sheer talent he is.\xe2\x80\x9d The tribute was merited but hardly a glowing recommendation of the players who will have to lift Liverpool next season. It also raised questions over the manager\xe2\x80\x99s deployment of his captain in the tail end of this campaign if, as Rodgers maintained, Gerrard remains Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s finest talent at the veteran stage of his career. Andy Hunter</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Liverpool 2-1 QPR  \xe2\x80\xa2 Oven-ready players deny room for grow-your-own talent to flourish  \xe2\x80\xa2 Rodgers pays tribute to Rio Ferdinand\xe2\x80\x99s wife Rebecca Ellison  6) Is Delph the best midfield player in the country?  <p>Tim Sherwood would probably admit that he can get a little carried away at times, but maybe the Aston Villa manager had a point when he praised Fabian Delph for his outstanding performance against Everton and said that the England international \xe2\x80\x9cshowed why he\xe2\x80\x99s probably, in my opinion, the best midfield player in the country at the moment\xe2\x80\x9d. Roy Hodgson cannot have failed to have been impressed as he looked on from the stands at Villa Park and saw Delph snapping into tackles, using the ball intelligently, dribbling past opponents, setting up goals and, with the armband on his sleeve, inspiring his team-mates. It still seems remarkable that Villa, at a time when Delph had less than six months remaining on his contract and the club were sliding towards the Championship under Paul Lambert, were able to convince the 25-year-old to sign a new deal. The way Delph is playing at the moment he could have picked his club in the summer if he was on a free transfer. Stuart James</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Aston Villa 3-2 Everton  7) Why did Moss send Duff off?  <p>Jon Moss\xe2\x80\x99s decision to send off Michael Duff in the first half of West Ham v Burnley was a perplexing one. This is a man who is refereeing the FA Cup final later this month and the whole stadium was surprised when the red card emerged to kill off any hopes of a Burnley comeback. The decision to award a penalty was certainly correct. Duff brought down Cheikhou Kouyat\xc3\xa9 with a clumsy challenge but there were covering defenders in place, potentially preventing the West Ham midfielder from obtaining a clear, goalscoring opportunity.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Burnley, they never recovered. Mark Noble slotted home and they could not muster a fightback with 10 men. As Dyche put it: \xe2\x80\x9cI think the groundsman was surprised it was a sending-off. I think the linesmen were surprised it was a sending-off. There was a tube station nearby where they were surprised it was a sending-off.\xe2\x80\x9d Moss will hope to avoid similar controversy at Wembley in a few weeks\xe2\x80\x99 time.

Photograph: IPS/Rex Shutterstock    8) Did Sunderland recruit Advocaat too late? <p>Clear, calm, coherent and with a nice line in understated humour Dick Advocaat is very much the antidote to the am-dram highs and lows Sunderland experienced under his volatile predecessors Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio. Slowly but surely a limited side are responding to his tutelage. \xe2\x80\x9cAdvocaat is an experienced man and a good coach and I think he is getting a little bit extra out of the players,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ronald Koeman after seeing his Southampton side sunk 2-1 on Wearside on Saturday. With previously indifferent individuals such as Jordi G\xc3\xb3mez and Danny Graham finally beginning to blossom and Lee Cattermole proving he can be much more effective when allowed to advance from the deep anchoring position Poyet liked to restrict him to, cautious optimism is returning. But Sunderland are still in the bottom three with Everton to travel to and Leicester to entertain before two daunting away dates at Arsenal and Chelsea. Survival will be touch and go. Even Advocaat cannot wave a magic wand and airbrush the reality that this is an ageing, lightweight and, above all, slow side but, by making Sunderland more direct, injecting attacking urgency and ramping up the intensity of their pressing he has clearly improved them. Might Ellis Short soon be wishing he had sacked Poyet and imported Advocaat a month or so earlier? Louise Taylor</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Sunderland 2-1 Southampton  9) Monk an outside shot for manager of the season <p>In a season where, by and large, the drama has decreased as the evenings have lengthened, Swansea have shown the benefits of retaining their focus into the final weeks. Plenty of teams have been accused of checking out early, but nobody could level that claim at Garry Monk\xe2\x80\x99s side, whose 2-0 win over Stoke took them to 53 points, well beyond their previous best Premier League haul (47 under Brendan Rodgers in 2011-12). Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s continued commitment is all the more impressive, given that their season had looked over as early as January, when an FA Cup exit at Blackburn left them to focus on a league campaign where they sat 10th. Anyone who thought Swansea were safe way back then should take note of the team who were a place below them, on the same points total \xe2\x80\x93 Newcastle. While John Carver\xe2\x80\x99s side have been in freefall in their flip-flops, Swansea have done what was required and more. Eight victories since then, against a number of teams with supposedly much more to play for, have put Swansea in touch with the top six. A tough run-in (Arsenal away, Man City at home, Palace away) may scupper their chances of a Europa League place, but if Monk can haul the Swans above Southampton \xe2\x80\x93 or even if he gets them close \xe2\x80\x93 he should by rights have some claim to be the manager of the season. Niall McVeigh</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Swansea City 2-0 Stoke City   10) Downing has faded on the wing <p>Stewart Downing was in the form of his life before Christmas. He was outstanding at the tip of West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s diamond and played a huge part in their unlikely ascent into the top four. Yet injuries have forced the side to dispense with that system in recent months and that has meant Sam Allardyce has moved Downing to the right, where he is not as effective. He does not have the same freedom when his starting position is on the right and he was predictable against Burnley, too quick to cut back to his stronger left foot. Downing frustrates when he lacks confidence. He has not scored since 18 January.
