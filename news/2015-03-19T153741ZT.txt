b'<p>DUSTING OFF THE OLD \xe2\x80\x98CITY SLIPPERS\xe2\x80\x99 HEADLINE</p> <p>In 1990 a bunch of misers in severe-looking suits sat around a table pondering how best to rebrand England\xe2\x80\x99s most entertaining activity and sell it at a huge profit. As far as they could tell the nation was not properly utilising its greatest source of gratification for the sofa-bound masses. With moral compasses sent whizzing off course by the magnetic quality of astronomical stacks of pound coins, important decisions were made, TV executives were brought onside and late one night Jeremy Beadle\xe2\x80\x99s telephone rang. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Richard Scudamore of People Falling Over to Comedy Sound Effects. You\xe2\x80\x99ve Been Framed was born. It has been making millions ever since. Yes, millions and millions of pounds from capturing on camera the thrilling failure of people being able to stay upright. Slip, Crash, Guffaw! Kerching! Slip, Crash, Guffaw, Kerching! Watching people landing on their tails was a lucrative business. You can see where this is going can\xe2\x80\x99t you?</p> <p>Well, anyway, a year or two later another bunch of misers in severe-looking suits sat around a table pondering how best to rebrand England\xe2\x80\x99s second-most entertaining activity. They did this pretty successfully too. People loved watching Slip, Crash, Guffaw! football. And England did it better than most. So well in fact that people all around the globe loved watching it too. On Saturdays and Sundays (and Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and soon-to-be Fridays) the world readjusted satellite dishes and people packed into stadiums to see Slip, Crash, Guffaw! football played at such a pace that many considered it to be the best football there was \xe2\x80\x93 the best because it is chock-full of hubris. Yes, just like You\xe2\x80\x99ve Been Framed. It also made millions and millions. And then billions and billions.</p> <p>There were more skilful proponents of normal football, of course, but entertainment doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be high-quality to be bring in huge viewing figures. No, just ask ITV. In fact, English football\xe2\x80\x99s most successful period in recent Big Cup excursions in the mid-noughties culminated in a nadir for Slip, Crash, Guffaw! football. Blame Rafa Ben\xc3\xadtez and Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho for that \xe2\x80\x9csh!t on a stick\xe2\x80\x9d nonsense. So The Fiver was heartened by Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s efforts at the Camp Nou last night, when their players used one of the most high-profile TV occasions to showcase a stunning display of Slip, Crash, Guffaw! football in which half of their team chose to play on their tails, instead of their feet. Lionel Messi duly sentenced them to death by a thousand nutmegs and English football\xe2\x80\x99s last remaining team was sent tumbling out of Big Cup at the earliest possible knockout stage. Impressive.</p> <p>And after Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea also took early leave from Big Cup there has been concern today about where this is all heading. Is English football going down the pan? Will \xc2\xa35bn of TV coin help its teams become Big Cup heavyweights again? The Fiver couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give a solitary one. And nor should anyone else who likes being right royally entertained. The fact that James Milner\xe2\x80\x99s Slip, Crash, Guffaw! attempt to tackle Messi is today\xe2\x80\x99s most-popular highlight of last night\xe2\x80\x99s match is evidence that English football is doing what it has always done best, well, better than ever. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see it as a failure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Manuel Pellegrini of City\xe2\x80\x99s exit. Neither does The Fiver. The Premier League will keep on keeping on with or without Big Cup success \xe2\x80\x93 as long as its players keep falling over.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Scott Murray from 6pm GMT for MBM coverage of Dynamo Kyiv 1-0 Everton (agg: 2-2, Dynamo through on away goals) in Big Vase, while Ian McCourt will be on hand for a Big Vase clockwatch from around then too.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve have had discussions with Tom and his dad over the last week or so and he has decided he does not want to considered for the Under-21s\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Gareth Southgate reveals the priorities of Hull City\xe2\x80\x99s Tom Ince, who\xe2\x80\x99s currently on his latest loan to the Championship.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAfter reading Martin Mason\xe2\x80\x99s berating of your \xe2\x80\x98Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Celtic\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Pope\xe2\x80\x99s Rangers\xe2\x80\x99 [sic] \xe2\x80\x98in-joke\xe2\x80\x99 being (in his opinion) not \xe2\x80\x98funny in the first place and less so after seeing it for the 70th or 80th time\xe2\x80\x99 (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letter), I\xe2\x80\x99d give this advice.

What I did do was to inform the players about what these people had been saying. I thought it was important that they knew.
