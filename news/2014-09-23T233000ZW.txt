b'<p>\xe2\x80\x9cNottingham Forest played Derby on Sunday,\xe2\x80\x9d begins Doug Walmsley. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir head-to-head in major competition is 34 wins to Derby, 37 to Forest with 23 draws. Derby having scored 144, Forest scoring 141. Is there a closer derby record?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>To answer this, first we must define closeness. Clearly it requires both clubs to have won a similar number of all the matches played between them but how important is it that they have also scored a similar number of goals? While clearly adding a little luxurious sheen to the statistics Doug Walmsley quotes, in the Knowledge\xe2\x80\x99s opinion it\xe2\x80\x99s no more than a handy bonus \xe2\x80\x93 what we\xe2\x80\x99re really looking for is the smallest difference between the number of wins recorded by rival teams in head-to-head encounters.</p> <p>So we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken a semi-exhaustive list of the classic rivalries in English and Scottish domestic football, found the teams\xe2\x80\x99 all-time head-to-head records (accepting that in some cases the matches started before the rivalry), worked out the difference between the number of games won by the two teams and expressed it as a percentage of all games won by either team (leaving draws out of it, as they\xe2\x80\x99re even enough already). We\xe2\x80\x99ve then ranked the rivalries by this percentage figure (which we\xe2\x80\x99ve termed the supremacy rating) to find which are the most closely-contested, and which the most one-sided, with the lowest figures indicating the most closely-balanced battles and the highest the most one-sided. We have used all-competition statistics \xe2\x80\x93 some might argue that we should only have used the league results, but we think they\xe2\x80\x99d be wrong.</p> <p>As the questioner suggests, Nottingham Forest and Derby County do have a very well-contested rivalry, with a supremacy rating of just 2.8, but that is only good enough to put them fourth on our list. There are two rivalries that are perfectly poised, with nothing between Crystal Palace and Brighton despite playing 98 matches (they\xe2\x80\x99ve drawn 24 of them) and Fulham similarly conjoined with QPR after 31 games.</p> <p>How, then, to split these two to decide the most finely-fought derby in the nation? In many ways it would be fairest just to award the honour to the Eagles and the Seagulls for having played more than three times as many games as the two London sides, but in the spirit of the question we\xe2\x80\x99ll go back to goals. In their derby games Fulham have scored 24 times and QPR 17, so the difference between their two tallies (7) amounts to 17.1% of the total; in the M23 derby Palace have scored 139 times and Brighton 131, with the difference between their tallies (8) amounting to just 3% of the total. It is, then, any way you look at it, the closest derby in the land.</p>  British football rivalry wins and ratings   Crystal Palace 37-37 Brighton  Supremacy rating 0   Fulham 13-13 QPR  Supremacy rating 0   Blackburn 41-39 Burnley  Supremacy rating 2.5   Derby 35-37 Nottingham Forest  Supremacy rating 2.8   Bolton 15-16 Wigan  Supremacy rating 3.2   Colchester 28-30 Southend  Supremacy rating 3.4   Sheffield United 45-42 Sheffield Wednesday  Supremacy rating 3.4   Sunderland 49-53 Newcastle  Supremacy rating 3.9   Rangers 160-145 Celtic Supremacy rating 4.9   Aston Villa 42-38 Birmingham City  Supremacy rating 5   Ipswich 43-38 Norwich  Supremacy rating 6.2   Leeds United 25-29 Huddersfield  Supremacy rating 7.4   Liverpool 64-75 Manchester United  Supremacy rating 7.9   Port Vale 16-19 Stoke  Supremacy rating 8.6   Wrexham 37-31 Chester Supremacy rating 8.8   West Brom 64-53 Wolves  Supremacy rating 9.4   Middlesbrough 40-49 Newcastle  Supremacy rating 10.1   Cardiff 22-27 Swansea  Supremacy rating 10.2   Watford 28-35 Luton  Supremacy rating 11.1   Brentford 16-20 Fulham Supremacy rating 11.1   Plymouth 32-25 Exeter  Supremacy rating 12.3   Chelsea 63-49 Tottenham  Supremacy rating 12.5   Nottingham Forest 39-30 Notts County  Supremacy rating 13.0   Middlesbrough 46-60 Sunderland  Supremacy rating 13.2   Everton 66-88 Liverpool  Supremacy rating 14.3   Arsenal 74-54 Tottenham  Supremacy rating: 15.6   Man City 48-68 Manchester United  Supremacy rating 17.2   Bury 24-16 Rochdale  Supremacy rating 20   Blackpool 31-48 Preston  Supremacy rating 21.5   Hereford 9-14 Shrewsbury Supremacy rating 21.7   Grimsby 47-30 Lincoln  Supremacy rating 22.1   Bristol City 47-29 Bristol Rovers  Supremacy rating 23.7   Dundee 45-75 Dundee United  Supremacy rating 25   Millwall 6-10 West Ham  Supremacy rating 25   Charlton 19-33 Crystal Palace  Supremacy rating 26.9   Hearts 138-79 Hibernian Supremacy rating 27.2   Manchester United 46-26 Leeds United  Supremacy rating 27.8   Oxford 13-23 Swindon  Supremacy rating 27.8   Portsmouth 9-19 Southampton  Supremacy rating 35.7   <p>The Knowledge is aware that football exists outside the British isles, and readers have tipped us off about a few South American rivalries that would come close to, or better, anything we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to offer. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Supercl\xc3\xa1sico Mexicano features Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s two largest teams, Club Am\xc3\xa9rica and Club Deportivo Guadalajara (Chivas),\xe2\x80\x9d writes Tim Dockery. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have faced off 183 times in official games (non-friendlies). Am\xc3\xa9rica (having won 65) has a five-game win advantage which equals 4% of all of the games won by either side. Chivas has outscored Am\xc3\xa9rica by four goals in those games, a difference of 0.87% of all 458 goals scored.\xe2\x80\x9d Closer still is the Cl\xc3\xa1sico Regiomontano, between Monterrey and Tigres. \xe2\x80\x9cOf the 102 games that they have contested,\xe2\x80\x9d Tim continues, \xe2\x80\x9cMonterrey have won 36, and Tigres have won 35 [a supremacy rating of 1.4]. In those games, Monterrey has scored two more goals than Tigres out of an aggregate of 222 goals, a difference of 0.90%.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ecuador\xe2\x80\x99s biggest derby, between Barcelona (not that one) and Emelec \xe2\x80\x93 otherwise known as the Cl\xc3\xa1sico del Astillero \xe2\x80\x93 is another close one. \xe2\x80\x9cCounting National Championship plus Copa Libertadores, Barcelona lead 68-65 [a supremacy rating of 2.3], and by 230-226 in goals,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Jordi Gomez. \xe2\x80\x9cActually, the question comes a bit late. After Emelec won 1-2 at the Monumental in 12 June 2010 the record was exactly 62-62, and they drew in the following five derbies. Nothing could split them until Barcelona won 2-0 in 19 November 2011.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>But reader Martin K tipped us off about a derby that would better anything on our list. According to Wikipedia, the head-to-head record in Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s Cl\xc3\xa1sico Santafesino, between Colon and Union of Santa Fe, is 26 wins each from 82 meetings, with 95 goals to Colon and 99 to Union, the difference between the teams\xe2\x80\x99 goals (4) being 2.1% of the total goals scored.</p> <p>If you know of a more finely balanced derby, let us know at the address below \xe2\x80\x93 or if you know of a particularly unbalanced one there\xe2\x80\x99s another derby-based question at the bottom of the page that might be of interest.</p> PIZZA, GOLD DISCS AND SEXY CAR WASHES <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the most unusual prize awarded to a football player or team for their performances on the field?\xe2\x80\x9d asks Claire Smithson.</p> <p>I refer the question-poser back to the Knowledge of 3 July 2013, which recounted tales of goalscorers being given free stuff (beer, mainly) in return for their net-busting feats. This question opens the topic up to all players in any position, thus opening the door to a few different tales.</p> <p>When Sevilla won the Europa League earlier this year, every player was given their own body weight in beer by the club sponsor, Cruzcampo. In all they got over 4,000 bottles. Similarly(ish), Sir Alex Ferguson received a lifetime\xe2\x80\x99s supply of Carling in 2003 in recognition of his managerial achievements, although given his well-known preference for fine wine he\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely to have actually drunk much of it.</p> <p>Foodstuffs have been a fairly popular bonus, with the former Bournemouth goalkeeper Ian Leigh famously given a lifetime supply of pizza by a local Italian restaurant in return for his keeping a clean sheet against Manchester United in the 1984 FA Cup third round, the game that put Harry Redknapp on the managerial map. A couple of years later the restaurant was sadly taken over my a new owner, who refused to honour the pledge. The miserly new boss was a certain Mr H Redknapp.</p> <p>Then there\xe2\x80\x99s celery. \xe2\x80\x9cNot sure this counts,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Joseph Tesoriero [I\xe2\x80\x99ve checked, and it does], \xe2\x80\x9cbut Ian Rush was given some celery and some wine by then chairman of Chelsea Ken Bates when the two teams faced each other in Rush\xe2\x80\x99s final game in his first stint for Liverpool in 1987. This was apparently to recognize Rush\xe2\x80\x99s achievements with Liverpool. The celery was Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s official vegetable at the time.\xe2\x80\x9d In a very vaguely similar vein, Trevor Francis played so well for Birmingham that Jeff Lynne of ELO gave him a gold disc, \xe2\x80\x9cto show our appreciation of him as the best footballer in the world\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Houses always come in handy, and have been regularly handed out, including to every member of the 1930 Uruguay World Cup squad, and every member of Zaire\xe2\x80\x99s 1974 team. The Leopards also got a green Volkswagen, particularly handy as cars are always near the very top of any footballer\xe2\x80\x99s wishlist. Last year the Mansfield Town chairman, John Radford, was so impressed by the team\xe2\x80\x99s 8-1 victory over Barrow he gave the manager, Paul Cox, his Aston Martin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to give people targets and things like that,\xe2\x80\x9d Radford explained. \xe2\x80\x9cHe fancied the car and I thought I\xe2\x80\x99m about ready for a change.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The then Cannes chairman, Alain Pedretti, came good on a promise to give Zinedine Zidane a car on the occasion of his first goal in professional football in 1994. In 2012 the Doncaster Rovers chairman, John Ryan, said he\xe2\x80\x99d buy Kyle Bennett a brand new Bentley Continental if he scored \xe2\x80\x93 but specified that the midfielder would have to notch not just once but 20 times that season before he was handed the keys. The incentive didn\xe2\x80\x99t do much to improve the player\xe2\x80\x99s goalscoring record: Bennett, who when the offer was made that August had scored in both of his side\xe2\x80\x99s first two league games of the season, ended the campaign with a tally, in all competitions, of three.</p> <p>Players at NEC Nijmegen last season didn\xe2\x80\x99t get new cars, but they did get their old cars to look like new \xe2\x80\x93 instead of the traditional bubbly whoever was named man of the match got their car cleaned by three bikini-clad blondes \xe2\x80\x93 or, as the club put it, a \xe2\x80\x9csexy car wash\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Elsewhere, a perusal of recent auctions of sporting memorabilia reveal that players historically received a lot of cigarette cases and tankards, neither of which the modern sportsman would of course have any need for (although Jack Wilshere might find them handy). More wholesomely, Gerald Emprechtinger writes that \xe2\x80\x9cafter winning the 1989 European Competition for women\xe2\x80\x99s football, each player of the victorious West Germany team received the 41-piece Villeroy &amp; Boch Mariposa coffee set by the DFB\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Though as it didn\xe2\x80\x99t reward a performance on the pitch it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really count, it\xe2\x80\x99s still worth mentioning that the Preston footballer Harry Jones was presented with the Royal Humane Society\xe2\x80\x99s honorary testimonial in 1932 for rescuing a drowning 10-year-old boy from the Manchester Ship Canal. And finally, it is the Knowledge\xe2\x80\x99s sad duty to report that the 2006 Guardian headline \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica offer World Cup carrot to Rossi\xe2\x80\x9d referred to the then Manchester United youngster Guiseppe Rossi getting the chance to claim a place in the United States squad for that summer\xe2\x80\x99s football tournament in Germany, not to him potentially being presented with a title-winning root vegetable.</p> MANAGERS WHO WALKED DURING PLAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHaving been taken off on a tangent by Wikipedia, not for the first time, I arrived at the page of Guy Roux,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Eamonn Kelly a few weeks back. \xe2\x80\x9cReading on I saw that Roux had resigned from RC Lens during a 2-1 loss to Strasbourg. Upon further investigation I discovered that he actually resigned after the game but my interest in the subject was piqued and hence my question: have any managers resigned from their posts during a game?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the 10th of March 2007 and the former European champions, Red Star Belgrade, hosted Vojvodina in the Serbian Superliga,\xe2\x80\x9d recalls Rastko Stanisic. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Serbian championship is quite like Scotland\xe2\x80\x99s (before Rangers were relegated) in that only two teams have a genuine chance of winning it, and their every slip-up is either costly or is seen as an unforgivable sign of weakness. So it is no surprise that, after Vojvodina cruised to a shock 3-0 lead, Red Star fans, not famed for their patience and apparently being too drunk to remember that their team had a six-point lead over Partizan at the time, began chanting: \xe2\x80\x98Dusan Out!\xe2\x80\x99</p> <p>The Dusan in question was Dusan Bajevic, the manager (who also coached Olympiakos and AEK Athens to eight league titles in total and who sat on the bench when the former failed to defend THAT Steven Gerrard 90th-minute volley which put Liverpool through the group stage en route to Istanbul). What followed is one of the most hilarious and at the same time most pitiful scenes in recent Serbian football history. In the 72nd minute, as the chants continue, Bajevic responds by looking at his watch and slowly trudging off the pitch. He failed to show up at the post-match conference and no one at Red Star saw him again. And it took until last year for them to see the title again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHis exit was a blow to his reputation and that of Red Star,\xe2\x80\x9d the club president, Dragan Stojkovic, said at the time. \xe2\x80\x9cRed Star is bigger than any individual and there has to be a clear line separating emotions from professional obligations.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Incredibly, Bajevic had previous. AEK Athens fans were so furious when he left them to take over at Olympiakos in 1996 that they simply refused to accept him when he came back for a second spell six years later. For a couple of seasons he put up with it but it all came to a head during a match against Iraklis in 2004 when the coach\xe2\x80\x99s wife received so much abuse she fled the stadium before the kick-off, and her husband proceeded to quit shortly before half-time after fans unveiled a giant banner that read simply \xe2\x80\x9ctraitor\xe2\x80\x9d. The truly remarkable thing about the incident is the fans\xe2\x80\x99 hatred came to a head in a match AEK won 4-0. \xe2\x80\x9cYou all saw and heard what went on. I cannot take that - it is a matter of ethics, it hurts me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI regret leaving a job half-done. The players asked me to stay but I could not cope with this situation any longer.\xe2\x80\x9d Even more remarkably he was to return to AEK in 2008 for a third spell, which ended in 2010 a couple of weeks after he was punched in the face by a fan during a pre-season friendly.</p> KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE <p>\xe2\x80\x9cCan you tell me where the name \xe2\x80\x98Posh\xe2\x80\x99 for Peterborough United originates?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Mr CM Holmes, back in 2002. \xe2\x80\x9cNot one of my football chums knows.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>We didn\xe2\x80\x99t either, to be honest, until we went to the Peterborough United website. According to the club, their nickname probably comes from an advert looking for posh players placed 15 years before they were formed.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9c[The nickname\xe2\x80\x99s] origins are obscure, but are widely believed to have stemmed from player-manager Pat Tirrel, who said in the close season of 1921 he was looking for \xe2\x80\x98Posh players for a Posh team\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Russell Plummer.</p> <p>Tirrel wasn\xe2\x80\x99t player-manager of Peterborough, however, but another side \xe2\x80\x93 Peterborough and Fletton United. In 1932 they folded, leaving behind debts of \xc2\xa3248.1s.11p. Two years later, the Peterborough United of today were formed. As a completely separate entity, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to take the debts of Peterborough and Fletton United. They did, however, take one of their nicknames: Posh.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 For thousands more questions and answers, take a trip through the Knowledge archive.</p> CAN YOU HELP? <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFederico Fazio made his debut for Spurs the other night at the Partizan Stadium in Belgrade, a cool 1,700km or so from White Hart Lane (or a 20-hour drive according to Google Maps),\xe2\x80\x9d ponders Dave Miller. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this the furthest from his home ground a player has made his debut?\xe2\x80\x9d The Knowledge expects that Dave\xe2\x80\x99s referring to competitive debuts and tales of pre-season friendlies in outlandish outposts won\xe2\x80\x99t cut it.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhile watching a pre-match report on Portuguese TV recently, I learned that Lisbon\xe2\x80\x99s third club Belenenses had not won away to local rivals Sporting in over 60 years (a 1-1 draw at the Est\xc3\xa1dio Jos\xc3\xa9 Alvalade ensured this record continued),\xe2\x80\x9d Oliver Farry reports. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch unsuccessful streaks are not uncommon (I recall Spurs went more than 70 years without winning at Anfield before a 1-0 win in 1985 broke that duck) but are there worse instances in derby fixtures?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy team in the League of Ireland, Longford Town, played last week and Stephen Rice and Mark Salmon both scored,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Padraig Stapleton. \xe2\x80\x9cJust wondering if any similar food combos have ever scored in the same game?
