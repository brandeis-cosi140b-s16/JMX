b'Golden goal: Nayim for Zaragoza v Arsenal (1995)'


b'<p>There was no Ian Wright. Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s best player was suspended for their European Cup Winners\xe2\x80\x99 Cup final against Parma and the consensus was that they would be unable to cope without Wright. Nevio Scala\xe2\x80\x99s Parma, boasting the attacking might of Faustino Asprilla, Tomas Brolin and Gianfranco Zola, were heavy favourites.</p> <p>Then again Arsenal had experience of confounding expectations under George Graham. When it was up for grabs, they tended to snatch the prize first and ask questions later.</p> <p>It worked at Anfield in 1989 and five years later it worked against Parma in Copenhagen. Graham had a plan. He packed the midfield, played Alan Smith as a lone forward and trusted in that famous back five \xe2\x80\x93 Seaman, Dixon, Adams, Bould and Winterburn, the names roll off the tongue \xe2\x80\x93 to smother the Parma attack. The Italians were third in Serie A, Europe\xe2\x80\x99s strongest league, but they were feeling decidedly groggy after spending 90 minutes fruitlessly banging their heads against the red-and-white brick wall. Smith scored the only goal after 20 minutes and Graham\xe2\x80\x99s men held on to claim the club\xe2\x80\x99s first European trophy since they won the Fairs Cup in 1970. One-nil to the Arsenal had rarely sounded so sweet; and to think that some people reckon it can never be fun to be boring.</p> <p>Beating Parma without Wright was a stunning achievement by Graham and it was his sixth trophy in eight years as Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s manager. Yet the high would soon be replaced by a crushing low.</p>     Nayim goes for goal at the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris, 10 May 1995.  Photograph: Michel Lipchitz/AP    <p>Graham\xe2\x80\x99s descent at Arsenal was swift and remarkable, his tenure ending in scandal when a Premier League inquiry found that he had received bungs totalling more than \xc2\xa3400,000 from the transfers that took John Jensen and Pal Lydersen to Highbury. It was 21 February 1995, Arsenal were drifting in 10th place and Graham was out. Arsenal were ruthless. Turmoil threatened to engulf them.</p> <p>Stewart Houston, Graham\xe2\x80\x99s assistant, was appointed on a caretaker basis and Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s league form remained mediocre. They ended the season in 12th place, above Sheffield Wednesday on goal difference, a mere point above Coventry City, Everton and West Ham United. Only six points stood between Arsenal and the relegation zone; they were 38 points behind the champions, Blackburn Rovers. Southampton, Queens Park Rangers and Wimbledon finished above them. To put Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s woes into context, even Tottenham Hotspur looked down on them in the final standings. That has not happened again in the past 20 years.</p> <p>In Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s defence the league was not their priority during the season\xe2\x80\x99s final weeks. Europe was their sanctuary and they had placed their focus on retaining the Cup Winners\xe2\x80\x99 Cup instead. They relished the tournament and their status as holders gave them belief. They snuck past Brondby in the second round, winning 4-3 on aggregate, and when they drew 1-1 with Auxerre at Highbury in the first leg of their quarter-final, they won the second leg in France 1-0 thanks to an early goal from Wright.</p> <p>The semi-final against a strong Sampdoria side was a riotous contest. Arsenal won the first leg 3-2 at Highbury thanks to two goals from Steve Bould and one from Wright \xe2\x80\x93 yes, that is the right way round \xe2\x80\x93 while Vladimir Jugovic scored twice for the side from Genoa. The two away goals swung the balance of power Sampdoria\xe2\x80\x99s way.</p> <p>The second leg was a classic, one of the great performances from an English side in Europe. Roberto Mancini put Sampdoria ahead on away goals in the 14th minute, lobbing the stranded David Seaman (ho hum!), only for Wright to equalise in the 61st minute. Yet it looked as if Arsenal were going out when Claudio Bellucci scored with eight minutes to go, before making it 3-1 on the night and 5-4 to Sampdoria on aggregate by scoring again in the 85th minute. Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s resistance had been broken. The run was coming to an end \xe2\x80\x93 until an unlikely hero presented himself.</p> <p>Step forward, Stefan Schwarz. In the 88th minute Arsenal won a free-kick. It was 25 yards out and Schwarz took a huge run-up and sent a low shot skimming across the turf and into the bottom-left corner with his left foot to force extra-time. The match went to penalties and Arsenal were in the final after Sinisa Mihajlovic, Jugovic and Atillio Lombardo saw their spot-kicks saved by Seaman. More on him later.</p>     The Arsenal goalkeeper, David Seaman, fails to keep out the shot. Photograph: Michel Lipchitz/AP    <p>It could have been an all-English final at Paris Saint-Germain\xe2\x80\x99s Parc des Princes. Chelsea entered the competition after losing the FA Cup final to Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s double winners. It was their first appearance in Europe since the 1971-72 season, when they were dumped out of the Cup Winners\xe2\x80\x99 Cup on away goals by Sweden\xe2\x80\x99s Atvidabergs in the second round \xe2\x80\x93 an inauspicious way for the holders to exit. Glenn Hoddle\xe2\x80\x99s side edged through the early rounds and came up against Club Brugge in the last eight. They lost the first leg 1-0 in Belgium, but Chelsea were powered by their ludicrous grey and orange kit at Stamford Bridge and Brugge were overwhelmed by goals from Mark Stein and Paul Furlong.</p> <p>Yet Zaragoza were a tougher proposition. They won the Copa del Rey in 1994, beating Celta Vigo on penalties in the final, and they gave Chelsea a lesson in the first leg in Spain, winning 3-0. Chelsea fought back bravely in the second leg, but lost 4-3 on aggregate.</p> <p>The final was dull for long periods, with Ray Parlour and Paul Merson unable to exert any influence on the wings for Arsenal, and Zaragoza were the superior side. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir football was a mixture of arsenic and old Spanish lace, a lot of clever passing and movement punctuated by spoiling fouls, with Nayim one of the more persistent offenders,\xe2\x80\x9d The Guardian\xe2\x80\x99s David Lacey wrote.</p> <p>The breakthrough came in the 67th minute, Juan Esn\xc3\xa1ider belting a volley past Seaman from 25 yards, yet Arsenal were renowned for their stubbornness and equalised eight minutes later, John Hartson turning the ball in from close range. Was it fate?</p> <p>It certainly seemed that way when Seaman somehow pushed a header from Xavier Aguado on to a post and saw the ball bounce off his thigh and back into his grateful possession at the start of extra-time. Seaman was having a fine match.</p> <p>But wait. \xe2\x80\x9cI had played against Arsenal for five years with Tottenham and remembered they always played with a high defensive line, with the goalkeeper acting like a sweeper, so before the game I told my team-mates and our coach that we should try and shoot from the halfway line,\xe2\x80\x9d Nayim said.</p> <p>Zaragoza had done their homework. In the first half Santiago Arag\xc3\xb3n had already tried to lob Seaman. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not so easy,\xe2\x80\x9d Nayim said.</p>     David Seaman strikes a pose having been beaten \xe2\x80\x93 and stunned \xe2\x80\x93 by Nayim\xe2\x80\x99s strike. Photograph: Ben Radford/Getty Images    <p>Tottenham Hotspur fans quickly came up with a way to taunt their north London neighbours. \xe2\x80\x9cNayim, from the halfway line,\xe2\x80\x9d was the chant, which was not strictly true given that the up-and-under which sailed over Seaman\xe2\x80\x99s head in the last minute of extra-time was struck from 45 yards out. It does not belong in the same category as David Beckham\xe2\x80\x99s genre-defining effort against Wimbledon in 1996; Davor Suker\xe2\x80\x99s effort from the halfway line during Croatia\xe2\x80\x99s win over Denmark at Euro 96 would arguably have been more eye-catching than Nayim\xe2\x80\x99s goal if Peter Schmeichel had not hurtled back in time to make the save. \xe2\x80\x9cNayim\xe2\x80\x99s goal was more reminiscent of a wind-assisted lob from a similar range and angle with which Jason Cundy scored for Tottenham at Ipswich,\xe2\x80\x9d Lacey said. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps that gave him the idea.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Nonetheless it was spectacular from Nayim and the fascination was easy to understand at the time. People were not accustomed to seeing players shooting from that far out. Pel\xc3\xa9 tried his luck from the halfway line in the 1970 World Cup and Chris Waddle had a go in England\xe2\x80\x99s semi-final with West Germany at Italia 90, and while Nayim had an early draft, it was Beckham who wrote the book.</p> <p>It was an iconic moment, though. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember looking at Seaman the whole game and in the last minute I tried it \xe2\x80\x93 luckily everything went right,\xe2\x80\x9d Nayim said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy first thought was to play it to our forwards, but I saw that they were offside. That\xe2\x80\x99s when I decided to shoot.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was going to pass to a team-mate but I looked up and I saw Seaman coming out so I just kicked it. I was very lucky. It\xe2\x80\x99s my first goal against Arsenal after playing against them half a dozen times. For me it\xe2\x80\x99s something special as a former Tottenham player.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe goal was not a fluke. Anyone who knows me knows I intended it. At Spurs Paul Gascoigne and I used to stay behind after training and challenge each other: we would take shots from the halfway line, try to score from corners or aim to hit the bar. Paul was a phenomenon, an absolute star, but I could strike a ball well, too. I do understand people who do not know me thinking the goal was lucky, though - to try something like that in the last second of a final, from that far out and from near the touchline, is not normal.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Seaman, who was beaten from similar range by Ronaldinho\xe2\x80\x99s free-kick when Brazil knocked England out of the World Cup in 2002, was unprepared. He scampered backwards in a panic and tried to claw the ball away, but it was too late. He ended up crumpled in a heap in the back of his goal, an expression of pure incredulity on his face. He stayed there for a few seconds, unable to comprehend what had happened. Out of context, the oddly relaxed pose he struck, lying on his side and propping himself up with his right arm, made him look like David Brent lounging on a table during that excruciating photoshoot with Inside Paper.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was in the right position to sweep up,\xe2\x80\x9d Seaman said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the worst moment of my career. As soon as he hit it I knew I was in trouble. You don\xe2\x80\x99t expect someone to shoot from there but he meant it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The holders had been beaten by a goal that sparked 20 years of gags about Nayim being the most virile man in the world. \xe2\x80\x9cThat goal has really left a mark,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a little town called Trasmoz in Aragon, the province in which Zaragoza stands, that has a street called Gol de Nayim ( Nayim\xe2\x80\x99s Goal Street),\xe2\x80\x9d Nayim said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve also got friends at Spurs who tell me about the T-shirts they sell with The Lobster on them and about the songs, although I must admit I\xe2\x80\x99d never heard the joke about the footballer with the biggest manhood lobbing Seaman before. I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe no one told me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Arsenal and Paris, eh? They never have much luck there. The Stade de France was the venue when Barcelona came from behind to beat them in the Champions League final 11 years later.</p> <p>Still, Arsenal quickly got over the defeat to Zaragoza. They signed Dennis Bergkamp a month later. The beginning of the end for Graham was the start of a brilliant new chapter in Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s history.</p>         Watch the goal here. '
