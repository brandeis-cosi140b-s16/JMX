b'Swansea City 0-5 Chelsea | Premier League match report'


b'<p>Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s away form had been giving them cause for concern, but they put it right in the most emphatic fashion, moving five points clear at the top of the Premier League by inflicting on Swansea one of their worst defeats since they arrived at elite level in 2011. Only Liverpool had previously scored five against them.</p> <p>The outcome was settled before half-time, by which stage Chelsea led 4-0, with their fans chanting the name of Diego Costa, whose two goals took his personal contribution to 17 in 19 League appearances.</p> <p>For Swansea, this record home defeat, not just in the Premier League but ever, leaves them with having won just two of their last eight League games, their European ambitions in increasing jeopardy.</p> <p>Had the result ramped up the pressure on Manchester City, who play Arsenal today? Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho thought not. He said: \xe2\x80\x9cThey have to win, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a responsibility, not a pressure. They have more experience than us, so for them it\xe2\x80\x99s not a problem.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Was this the best team Mourinho had ever had? He pondered the question before answering: \xe2\x80\x9cWe can play fantastically well, and this was a perfect game, but if we don\xe2\x80\x99t win the European Cup then in 20 years\xe2\x80\x99 time nobody will remember this team. They have to win competitions for that. It is a young team with years in front of them and together we are going to try to make history.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The capacity crowd were still pondering the team changes when Chelsea took the lead, with just 50 seconds played. A pass from Gylfi Sigurdsson failed to find its target, instead bouncing off Tom Carroll and enabling Oscar, the man of the match, to fasten on to the loose ball and run through the middle before scoring from the edge of the D.</p> <p>Flattering but to deceive, the Swans threatened to equalise after two minutes, when Sigurdsson sought to atone with a 25-yarder which hit the top of Peter Cech\xe2\x80\x99s right-hand post. Cech retained his place, despite the fact that Thibaut Courtois was fit again and on the bench.</p> <p>Swansea gave a first start to Nelson Oliveira, signed on loan from Benfica to compensate for Wilfried Bony\xe2\x80\x99s departure. Anonymous before he was substituted, it was not an occasion he will want to remember.</p> <p>The League leaders were, by a street, the better, more cohesive unit and they deservedly doubled the lead in the 20th minute, when Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas and Willian created the opportunity for Costa to score with a dead-eyed finish from near the penalty spot.</p> <p>The Swans were outmanoeuvred and overrun in midfield, where they were emasculated by the unavailability of Jonjo Shelvey, Leon Britton and Ki Sung-yueng. Mourinho sympathised, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was difficult for them without those three. That would be the same as us playing without F\xc3\xa0bregas, Matic and Mikel. Midfield is an area of the pitch that is important to them because they are a team that wants to play good football.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Before the half-hour mark Willian struck Lukasz Fabianski\xe2\x80\x99s left post with a thumping shot, but Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s third was only briefly delayed. Then a dreadful back pass from Frederico Fern\xc3\xa1ndez out on the right, gifted possession to Costa, who finished with aplomb, left to right. Swansea were spreadeagled on the deck and two minutes later it was 4-0, when Oscar\xe2\x80\x99s inviting centre saw Oscar score his second from 18 yards.</p> <p>Before half-time Willian rattled the woodwork for a second time after Costa had rounded Fabianski to set him up and the interval found the Swansea manager, Garry Monk, and his team very much in damage limitation mode.</p> <p>Fortunately for them, Chelsea eased up in the second half, their focus already on Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s Capital One Cup semi-final against Liverpool, and they contented themselves with just one more goal, side-footed in at close range by the substitute Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle.</p> <p>Given his history at Anfield, which includes Luis Garc\xc3\xada\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cghost\xe2\x80\x9d goal in the Champions League semi-finals, how important was the tie at Anfield? \xe2\x80\x9cOur next game is our most important, always,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said, with a knowing smile.</p> <p>Monk described Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s anaemic contribution as \xe2\x80\x9chorrible\xe2\x80\x9d, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cThe players are hurting and I\xe2\x80\x99m hurting. I can only apologise to the fans as the team\xe2\x80\x99s performance is my responsibility.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He sought consolation in the belief that they had played badly on only three occasions all season. \xe2\x80\x9cThree out of 22 isn\xe2\x80\x99t bad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe bigger picture is that we\xe2\x80\x99ve been good this season and I\xe2\x80\x99m positive that this result isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to have a negative effect on what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The two managers were in conversation as they disappeared down the tunnel at the final whistle. What had Monk said? \xe2\x80\x9cI told Jos\xc3\xa9 I was sorry I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give him a game today.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
