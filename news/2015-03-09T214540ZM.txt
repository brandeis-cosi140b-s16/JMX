b'Manchester United v Arsenal: FA Cup quarter-final \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>Arsenal walk off triumphant, having won at Old Trafford for the first time in 11 attempts at Old Trafford. They\xe2\x80\x99re into the semi-finals of the FA Cup - the draw is being covered live here - and I think they deserved this victory. They defended pretty well for the most part, scored a fine goal in the first half and were the better side after the break. The winner was a gift, but something like that always felt liable to happen and Danny Welbeck won\xe2\x80\x99t care? He won\xe2\x80\x99t. He was rewarded for his persistence and has dumped his old side out of the FA Cup. There will be more awkward questions for Louis van Gaal to answer after this, especially about Angel Di Maria\xe2\x80\x99s conduct. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re not a good team,\xe2\x80\x9d says Alan Shearer on the BBC. He\xe2\x80\x99s talking about Manchester United. Is he wrong?</p>     Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Per Mertesacker, Wojciech Szczesny and Olivier Giroud applaud the 9,000 travelling fans.
