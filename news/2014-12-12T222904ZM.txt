b'Manuel Pellegrini says Manchester City will look at strikers in window'


b'<p>Manchester City are considering whether to sign a striker in the January transfer window as Manuel Pellegrini weighs up the need to replace \xc3\x81lvaro Negredo, who is on a season-long loan at Valencia before joining the Spanish club permanently next summer.</p> <p>The manager also has the knee injury to Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero to consider now. The Argentinian, who has 19 goals this season, could be  out for up to eight weeks, meaning he may not return before City\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Chelsea on 31 January.</p> <p>Pellegrini currently has only Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic as fit, recognised forwards and, as Negredo cannot be recalled, he may decide he has to strengthen next month.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI never close any window about anything we can do to give us an advantage,\xe2\x80\x9d said City\xe2\x80\x99s manager onFriday. \xe2\x80\x9cIf all the teams can do it, we can do it also. If we are thinking about that \xe2\x80\x93 at this moment we\xe2\x80\x99re not \xe2\x80\x93 we will analyse in the moment what we are going to do. You remember, when \xc3\x81lvaro was sold in August, I said there were a lot of reasons why we made that decision. \xc3\x81lvaro couldn\xe2\x80\x99t play until the middle of November because he was injured, so it was just one and a half months, and then in January we will see if we need to replace him or not. Now we are in that moment we are going to make the best decision for the club.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Last season Dzeko scored 26 times for City. This season he has only four to date but Pellegrini is confident the Bosnian can provide the goals in Ag\xc3\xbcero\xe2\x80\x99s absence. \xe2\x80\x9cWe trust a lot in Edin,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had a very good season last season with us. He just renewed his contract. He did that because we trust in him and now it is his moment to try to score goals and return to the performance level he had before he was injured.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini said of Ag\xc3\xbcero: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult to say how many weeks he will be injured because it depends on the way he improves every day. The doctor said normally it could be six to eight weeks, so it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to know exactly.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>There are no plans to send the Argentinian home to recover over Christmas. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not an issue we are talking about in this moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pellegrini. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we are all concentrating on what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing here but Sergio will stay here because he needs to recover as soon as possible. To travel to South America takes a lot of days and means [there would be] less time he can work on his recovery.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini does not know yet precisely when Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 departs to join the Ivory Coast for the Africa Cup of Nations, which starts on 17 January. \xe2\x80\x9cI know it\xe2\x80\x99s in January. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is exactly the first of January but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s in the first 10 days of the month that he must go.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s absence reinforces Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s desire to keep Frank Lampard beyond the end of his six-month loan from New York City FC, and the manager reaffirmed it on Friday.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. He\xe2\x80\x99s a very important player for us and we need him in this moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pellegrini. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore December finishes we will have a decision but, as I repeat, I think Frank is a very important player for us and I hope we will not have any problems for him to stay here. But I cannot say just from one side what will happen.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Vincent Kompany is in the squad for Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Leicester City after missing the past three games because of a hamstring injury. The captain narrowly missed out on playing in Wednesday evening\xe2\x80\x99s 2-0 win at Roma that secured City\xe2\x80\x99s progress to the last 16 of the Champions League, after failing a late fitness test.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cKompany is in the squad list so I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he will have any problem to play,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pellegrini. David Silva should also be available. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will see. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel any pain in the knee from the 30 minutes [in Rome], so I think he will be fit,\xe2\x80\x9d the manager added.</p> <p>Pellegrini stated last Friday that Joe Hart was going to sign a new deal by the following day but the goalkeeper is yet to do so. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it is close. Joe wants to stay here and we want him to be our goalkeeper,\xe2\x80\x9d said the City manager.</p>'
