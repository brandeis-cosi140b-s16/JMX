b'Manchester City v Arsenal: five talking points from the Etihad Stadium | Jamie Jackson'


b'Advantage Chelsea before Stamford Bridge showdown <p>Wherever Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho was as this result came in, he may have chuckled as his side have now re-established some daylight \xe2\x80\x93 five points \xe2\x80\x93 from Manchester City before the latter\xe2\x80\x99s trip to west London on the final day of month. Manuel Pellegrini had said: \xe2\x80\x9cArsenal\xe2\x80\x99s visit will be a big test for us. They are always battling for one of the top four places in the Premier League and have some excellent players. We must play at a high tempo with 100% concentration and take our chances when they come.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet what the manager witnessed was an erratic display from his team, who appeared devoid of confidence, which was strange considering their 14-game unbeaten run before this. Now they dare not lose at Chelsea.</p> Arsenal break a long drought in east Manchester <p>The last occasion Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s side left the Etihad Stadium with a league victory was on 24 October 2010 when Samir Nasri opened the scoring for the visitors in a 3-0 win. A persistent charge against Arsenal is that they do not beat any of the title contenders enough, particularly away from home. The last time City, Chelsea or Manchester United had been defeated had come in October 2011 with a 5-3 win at Stamford Bridge. Leading 1-0 as the second half began Arsenal threatened to enter defend-for-your-life mode almost instantly which would have shown a troubling lack of courage. But they remembered how proceedings had been bossed to that point, took the contest to City again when they could and added a second that confirmed three points.</p> Fernandinho is no Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 <p>This was the third match the Ivorian Tour\xc3\xa9 has missed due to his Africa Cup of Nations duty and Fernandinho tried to fill the void he left behind. Beforehand the Brazilian said: \xe2\x80\x9cAs for my own preferences I am happy just to play in the team. I enjoy whichever role I\xe2\x80\x99m asked to do but I do enjoy playing more forward because that\xe2\x80\x99s my original position but I like the defensive position as well.\xe2\x80\x9d There was an attempt at a complete midfield performance as he made important tackles, unloaded some long-range passes \xe2\x80\x93 once, majestically, to David Silva as he ran into Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s area \xe2\x80\x93 but, in the final analysis, Fernandinho failed this audition to be a new Tour\xc3\xa9 and was replaced by Frank Lampard just after the hour.</p> All-action Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez is the Gunners\xe2\x80\x99 Wayne Rooney <p>Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s No17 offered a high-octane display that cast him in total footballer mode \xe2\x80\x93 the Gunners\xe2\x80\x99 version of Wayne Rooney \xe2\x80\x93 as the Chilean was seen chasing back and making tackles in his area while also running at City to ensure he was a prime factor for the visitors. A microcosm of this could be found in how S\xc3\xa1nchez headed away a corner then hunted down the ball to intercept and turn defence into attack. Beforehand Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cAlexis S\xc3\xa1nchez is in a good moment for Arsenal; he\xe2\x80\x99s playing very well. But Arsenal is not just one player. Normally these two teams are attacking teams.\xe2\x80\x9d The Chilean was right about his compatriot as Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s was an all-round performance but S\xc3\xa1nchez, not for the first time, was the catalyst.</p> Vincent Kompany has an afternoon to forget <p>Just over a month had passed since the captain last turned out due to the 25th injury of his City career and it showed. By the break Kompany was fortunate not to have been sent off after conceding the penalty from which Santi Cazorla started the scoring, the referee, Mike Dean, deciding not even to book him. The Belgian\xe2\x80\x99s culpability here was increased as he had conceded the ball originally, when moving into midfield, to allow the attack from which the spot kick derived. Kompany did receive a yellow card for a clumsy foul on Olivier Giroud later and with a \xc2\xa340m defender in Eliaquim Mangala in reserve Pellegrini might have considered the supposedly unthinkable of removing his leader to try to add solidity.</p>'
