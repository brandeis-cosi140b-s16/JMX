b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho promises Sydney Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s best in post-season friendly'


b'<p>Chelsea boss Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has promised to play a full strength side when English Premier League champions Chelsea meet Sydney FC on Tuesday night. The Portuguese said on arrival in Sydney that Chelsea felt they had a responsibility of playing to win and playing their best team.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what we are going to try to do,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho told a packed press conference. He said Chelsea felt an even bigger responsibility to achieve their goals just one week after lifting the Premier League title.</p> <p>The team touched down to a raucous reception at Sydney airport on Sunday, leaving captain John Terry a little stunned at the welcome afforded to him and his team-mates. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were all pretty tired and when we came through we all lit up,\xe2\x80\x9d Terry said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe welcome was overwhelming and we got mobbed a little bit but it was nice and we\xe2\x80\x99re delighted to be here.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Terry said Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s preparation for the match would include watching footage of Sydney FC\xe2\x80\x99s match on Saturday against Tottenham, which Spurs won 1-0 thanks to a Harry Kane goal. While Sydney were playing against Tottenham, Chelsea were defeating a Thai All Stars team 1-0 in Bangkok in front of 45,000 fans wearing blue shirts, another reminder to Mourinho of what his team owes its fans.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot lose,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot go just for fun. You have to go for the result. It\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of prestige and responsibility. We are still celebrating [the EPL title], yes. We are already thinking of next season, yes. But Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s match is our last match of this season, so we want to compete and give a good show.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Sydney FC coach Graham Arnold said he had to pinch himself to believe his team was playing against giants like Tottenham and Chelsea in the space of four days. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s incredible to be sitting at the same table with three world football superstars,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe A-League is young but it\xe2\x80\x99s developing further and further, and for Chelsea to add to the game of football in this country is mind-blowing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Sydney striker Shane Smeltz felt much the same, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cTo play Chelsea is a privilege, not just for Sydney FC but for football fans in general.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The match at ANZ Stadium has sold out in advance with many fans looking forward to a first chance to see their heroes in the flesh; Chelsea have not toured to Australia in 41 years. \xe2\x80\x9cPlaying in front of 83,000 [people] is huge. It\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic really,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said.</p>'
