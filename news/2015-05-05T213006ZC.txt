b'Chelsea consider summer move for Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s Antoine Griezmann'


b'<p>Chelsea intend to strengthen their squad for next season and are considering a summer move for the Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid forward, Antoine Griezmann.</p> <p>The France international, who effectively replaced Diego Costa at Vicente Calder\xc3\xb3n, has enjoyed a prolific season in Spain and is one of a number of potential recruits whose progress has been tracked closely. Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho hopes to add three or four senior players to his Premier League champions in anticipation of losing Petr Cech, Filipe Lu\xc3\xads and Didier Drogba.</p> <p>The club\xe2\x80\x99s recruitment department, headed by the technical director Michael Emenalo, are hoping to conduct business as efficiently as last summer when their major additions \xe2\x80\x93 other than Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my, whose transfer was necessitated by Fernando Torres\xe2\x80\x99s departure on deadline day \xe2\x80\x93 were secured relatively early.</p> <p>While they retain clout in the market, there could yet be one significant sale to offer Chelsea more leeway given the desire to comply with Uefa\xe2\x80\x99s financial fair play regulations.</p> <p>Griezmann has scored 25 goals for Atl\xc3\xa9tico since his \xc2\xa323m arrival from Real Sociedad last July on a six-year contract, though his club are attempting to renegotiate the terms of that arrangement given the current deal includes a buyout clause set at around \xc2\xa343m. Atl\xc3\xa9tico\xe2\x80\x99s keenness to redraft Griezmann\xe2\x80\x99s contract reflects how well the 24-year-old has done in his first year under Diego Simeone but the clause as it stands offers suitors the chance to prise him away.</p> <p>Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s summer dealings are likely to revolve heavily around Atl\xc3\xa9tico, as they did a year ago when Costa and Filipe Lu\xc3\xads were bought and Thibaut Courtois ended a three-year loan spell in the Spanish capital. The Brazilian left-back may return to his former club having failed to make an impact this year, while there is interest in Toby Alderweireld \xe2\x80\x93 a versatile defender or midfielder who has enjoyed an excellent season on loan at Southampton and recently joined Jorge Mendes\xe2\x80\x99 stable of clients \xe2\x80\x93 the Spain international midfielder Koke and Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s forward Pedro Rodr\xc3\xadguez.</p> <p>The Premier League champions have also looked at the Getafe goalkeeper, Vicente Guaita, and retain an interest in Queens Park Rangers\xe2\x80\x99 Rob Green, who will become a free agent on 1 July, on the assumption Cech will end an 11-year spell at Stamford Bridge by seeking regular first-team football elsewhere this summer. The Czech international may favour remaining in London with Arsenal, though there is strong interest from abroad.</p> <p>Reports have also been compiled on Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s Morgan Schneiderlin and the England full-back Nathaniel Clyne, whose long-term future is in doubt at St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s. Initial interest in the Swiss left-back, Ricardo Rodr\xc3\xadguez, at Wolfsburg is unlikely to be pursued.</p> <p>Regardless, there is an acceptance that reinforcements will be needed before a sterner test next term. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course next season is going to be more difficult for us,\xe2\x80\x9d Nemanja Matic said. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone knows we are champions, they will fight against us with more motivation. But we deserve that. We are Chelsea, and we know what we have to do.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
