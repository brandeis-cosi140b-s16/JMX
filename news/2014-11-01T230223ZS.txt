b'Saturday Sundae: Traor\xc3\xa9 goes for the gloves and Stelling\xe2\x80\x99s spooky surprise'


b'MAN OF THE DAY <p>Last week Ayoze P\xc3\xa9rez scored his first for Newcastle and won them three points at Spurs. He was at it again against Liverpool.</p> SCAPEGOAT OF THE DAY <p>Mario Balotelli \xe2\x80\x93 managed one touch inside Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s box, and took his run without a league goal to 689 minutes. Team-mates not giving him the ball may be a factor.</p> BEST AWKWARD FACTS  <p>\xc2\xa330m Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas now has as many assists this season as \xc2\xa342m Mesut \xc3\x96zil managed in the whole of last season; and Cristiano Ronaldo has found the net 20 times since Aston Villa last scored.</p> WINTER WEAR <p>While London sweltered in 18C November sunshine, QPR\xe2\x80\x99s Armand Traor\xc3\xa9 decided he just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do without gloves.</p> MOST PUT-OUT <p>Joey Barton played for QPR\xe2\x80\x99s Under-21s in the morning as he recovers from injury, and planned to spend his afternoon watching the seniors at Chelsea. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a ticket and went to Brentford v Derby instead.</p> MOST COSMOPOLITAN  <p>Eddy Pascual, who played for Granada against Real Madrid having come through at Milan, has a dad from Angola and a mother from Azerbaijan. He was born in Spain.</p> BEST HALLOWEEN MOMENT <p>Nick Cotton\xe2\x80\x99s EastEnders comeback trumped by the lights going out on Jeff Stelling. Cue grown pundits making ghost noises.</p> COMEBACK OF THE DAY <p>Three goals in 20 minutes had Elgin feeling smug in their Scottish Cup game against Bo\xe2\x80\x99ness United. Bo\xe2\x80\x99ness then hit three in eight minutes to draw level. It ended 4-4.</p>'
