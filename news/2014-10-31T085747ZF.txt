b'Football transfer rumours: Manchester United move for Abdul Majeed Waris?'


b'<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s Hallowe\xe2\x80\x99en, and cute little kiddies all around the world go out to observe the time-honoured custom of Food And Coin Now Or Window Put Through With Brick. Steven Gerrard is too old to play that game these days, but that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped him issuing a threat of his own today. He\xe2\x80\x99s told Liverpool he might be off in the summer if they don\xe2\x80\x99t get a wriggle on and offer him a new contract. Where to? Good question.</p> <p>Manchester United are in for a couple of strikers, because they\xe2\x80\x99ve got that habit now. Abdul Majeed Waris of Trabzonspor and Italian hitman Mario Balo \xe2\x80\xa6 hold on \xe2\x80\xa6 Mattia Destro are in their sights. Chelsea are also interested in the Roma forward. Arsenal, meanwhile, desperately need a defensive midfielder and as many defenders as they can source, so naturally they\xe2\x80\x99re in for Destro too, as well as Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s 73rd-choice striker Pedro.</p> <p>Manchester United and Chelsea also plan to do battle over the Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid centre-back Jo\xc3\xa3o Miranda. He\xe2\x80\x99ll cost \xc2\xa318m, though United hope to barter that price down by throwing in Juan Mata.</p> <p>Crystal Palace and QPR are both interested in the Spurs full-back Beno\xc3\xaet Assou-Ekotto.</p> <p>And it\xe2\x80\x99s now only two months until all the mid-season transfer frolics begin, so the quality of rumour should pick up again fairly soon. We hope.</p>'
