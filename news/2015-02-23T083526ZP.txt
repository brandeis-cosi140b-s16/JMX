b'Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend action | Guardian writers'


b'1) Is Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s propaganda harming his team? <p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho is an expert at using a germ of truth to create a toxic stink. But what if his propaganda is not as clever as he thinks? What if it is counter-productive? Presumably his rhetoric is intended both to fuel his players with righteous indignation and let referees know that any mistakes they make to the detriment of Chelsea will be mercilessly highlighted by a manager who is rarely slow to make dark allusions. But what if referees have become so eager to show they are not influenced by Mourinho and that, when in doubt, they subconsciously err on the side of the opposition? And what if some Chelsea players drunk so much of Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s Kool Aid that they instinctively start to take the law into their own hands, as Nemanja Matic did when wronged by Ashley Barnes and, indeed, as Branislav Ivanovic quite literally did as he grabbed Martin Atkinson\xe2\x80\x99s red card as he tried to convince the referee not to brandish it to his team-mate. A more pernickety official than Atkinson, or one ill-disposed towards Chelsea, might have sent off two of Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s players on Saturday. Paul Doyle</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Chelsea 1-1 Burnley\xe2\x80\xa2 Mourinho brands Barnes\xe2\x80\x99s foul on Matic \xe2\x80\x98criminal\xe2\x80\x99 in TV outburst\xe2\x80\xa2 Chelsea fans allegedly involved in Paris M\xc3\xa9tro racist incident identified\xe2\x80\xa2 Paul Wilson: Mourinho spot-on with response to Paris incident</p>  2) Palace lacked a cutting edge  <p>Alan Pardew said that Crystal Palace\xe2\x80\x99s performance in their 2-1 defeat to Arsenal was the best that they have produced since he took over last month and the numbers certainly helped his argument. Palace had more shots, more possession and more corners, while they also felt that Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s first goal should have been a free-kick instead of a penalty and that their second goal should have been disallowed for offside. Yet Palace were not refined enough in the final third. They failed to test David Ospina in the first half and although there were some near misses in the second half, the Arsenal goalkeeper did not make a meaningful save until he kept out a Glenn Murray header near the end. Palace\xe2\x80\x99s forceful style would have paid off if Murray\xe2\x80\x99s stoppage-time header had flown an inch or two to the left, instead of crashing against the post, but the truth is that they need more subtlety.

On Tuesday evening at the Etihad, Lionel Messi and company will attempt to dismantle City for a consecutive year at the competition\xe2\x80\x99s last-16 stage. Yet seven matches into a return from a knee injury and Ag\xc3\xbcero is again reaching peak performance, scoring three in his last two matches to take his count to 22 from 30 City appearances. The last of these came in City\xe2\x80\x99s 5-0 trouncing of Newcastle United on Saturday and had his manager praising him before Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s visit .</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEvery game Kun plays he is improving more and is now arriving again to the high performance level he had before his injury. I think that was one of the problems we had in January,\xe2\x80\x9d said Manuel Pellegrini of his team\xe2\x80\x99s poor form then. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must recover Kun and Edin Dzeko who both came back from long injury lay-offs and both needed minutes on the pitch to get back to their normal performance.\xe2\x80\x9d Bar\xc3\xa7a beware: Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 may be suspended, but Ag\xc3\xbcero is back in lethal mode. Jamie Jackson</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Manchester City 5-0 Newcastle\xe2\x80\xa2 Are City smart enough to penetrate Europe\xe2\x80\x99s meanest defence? \xe2\x80\xa2 Nasri: returning hero Tour\xc3\xa9 can lift City for key games\xe2\x80\xa2 Jamie Jackson: Bony can be showy but is a quality addition</p>  4) No need for Rodgers to act like an own brand Mourinho <p>It is at times hard to work out what Brendan Rodgers is getting at, or indeed whether he\xe2\x80\x99s really getting at anything at all or just following a template of learned Top Manager Behaviour. Certainly it is not immediately obvious what the point of coming out against Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s match day programme editor after his team\xe2\x80\x99s 2-0 victory at St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s Stadium. For one thing Rodgers was wrong: Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert were mentioned in the programme on the occasion of their return to the club. And secondly it is obviously none of his business what Southampton choose to put in a programme that was, naturally enough, devoted to current team matters rather than a fawning memorial to the opposition. The world is already full enough of people demanding respect/more respect/some kind of an apology, although in fairness this is perhaps a niche kind of low on that front. Football on the other hand has always been a place of mischief and iconoclasm. This is why we watch it in the first place.</p> <p>For the record Lambert was greeted warmly on his return, Lallana routinely booed in response to the circumstances of his departure, which ended with the player using an England press conference to deny he had threatened to go on strike if Southampton didn\xe2\x80\x99t sell him. And that should be the end of it. There were so many other worthy topics of conversation at the end of this match: Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s fine current run; Raheem Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s mature sense of menace; Filip Djuricic\xe2\x80\x99s excellent full debut. Instead we got an editorial conference, a needless attitude of offence, and the spectacle of a manager who might have taken a moment to dwell on his own recent successes instead coming on like an own brand Mourinho, seeking out a contrived and unnecessary moment of friction.

The American money men involved are John Jay Moores and Charles Noell, formerly franchise owners in Major League Baseball.</p> <p>With a \xc2\xa330m purchase mooted Huw Jenkins, the Swans\xe2\x80\x99 chairman, and the other seven directors would stand to make a fortune after paying only \xc2\xa320,000 each to take control in the old Fourth Division days, when the club was on the brink of folding, but Jenkins says: \xe2\x80\x9cAny movement away from the current set up will only be put in place if everyone connected to our club is convinced it\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing for the football club first and foremost. If not, I can see the status quo continuing for some years to come.\xe2\x80\x9d Joe Lovejoy</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Swansea 2-1 Manchester United\xe2\x80\xa2 Swansea open talks to buy Liberty Stadium, city council confirms \xe2\x80\xa2 Van Gaal reckons he has won hearts of Man Utd players and fans</p>  6) Demb\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9 sweats on Cup final    <div data-embed-type="table" class="player-card player-card--football" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <div class="player-card__image-container">  </div> <div class="player-card__player"> <div class="player-card__position" itemprop="jobTitle">Midfielder</div> <div class="player-card__name" itemprop="name">Mousa Dembele</div> </div> <dl class="player-card__stats"> <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Appearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">16</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Goals</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">1</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">8</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots on target</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">25%</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Offsides</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">0</dd> </dl> </div>   <p>If the battle for Capital One Cup final places against Chelsea next Sunday is on, then several Tottenham players did themselves no favours in what was a wild derby against West Ham United. Andros Townsend and \xc3\x89rik Lamela were peripheral on the flanks while Ryan Mason frustrated with his end product but it was Mousa Demb\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9 who crashed the hardest. The Belgium midfielder has enjoyed a run in Mauricio Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s team, and in his favoured role as the No10. Against West Ham, Pochettino took the surprise decision to start Christian Eriksen among the substitutes, which placed even greater creative responsibility on Demb\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9. But he chose a bad time to have a dreadful afternoon \xe2\x80\x93 he was at fault for West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s opening goal and frequently turned over possession. The home crowd got on his back and it was no surprise to see him replaced by Eriksen at half-time. David Hytner</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Tottenham 2-2 West Ham\xe2\x80\xa2 Allardyce says Tottenham were lucky to get draw against\xe2\x80\xa2 West Ham sign forward Nen\xc3\xaa for rest of season</p>  7) Mart\xc3\xadnez blundered by reinstating Howard for Robles <p>Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez described Tim Howard as a \xe2\x80\x9cvery strong performer\xe2\x80\x9d who has produced excellent displays at Chelsea and Young Boys of Bern following his return from injury. That is fair enough, but to absolve the Everton goalkeeper of any blame for a 2-2 draw with bottom of the table Leicester City, when his failure to deal with two crosses from the right led to both of the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 goals, smacked of a manager attempting to justify his decision to drop Joel Robles as soon as the USA international had recovered from a calf injury. Robles has defied expectation during his eight-match run in the Everton first team and his form was improving by the game, particularly in terms of commanding his area as Howard failed to do against Leicester. It was harsh to return Robles to the bench at Chelsea two weeks ago given Howard\xe2\x80\x99s form before injury had been unconvincing. An immediate recall for the veteran keeper issued the wrong message. Andy Hunter</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Everton 2-2 Leicester City \xe2\x80\xa2 The Gallery: Nigel Pearson \xe2\x80\xa2 Said &amp; Done: Chelsea; Arrigo Sacchi; and Ghana\xe2\x80\x99s witch problem</p>            Everton\xe2\x80\x99s Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez: Romelu Lukaku is unique \xe2\x80\x93 video    8) Sinclair\xe2\x80\x99s brio suggests penny may finally have dropped <p>Scott Sinclair has played like someone with a point to prove over the past week and Aston Villa\xe2\x80\x99s plight could provide a timely kickstart to a faltering career if he continues in this vein. Two goals in two games since Paul Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s departure suggests the penny may have dropped with the on-loan Manchester City winger and his pace, technique and eye for goal suggest Villa may have borrowed a hungry player eager to make up for lost time.</p> <p>Observers across Birmingham were dismayed by his lacklustre approach to the game last year as he barely raised a gallop for West Bromwich Albion. The strange thing about Sinclair is that, if he suffers from thinking himself a \xe2\x80\x98big time\xe2\x80\x99 celebrity footballer, he has surely benefited from this kick-up-the-backside before. He started among the elite, turning professional at Chelsea, only to have to work his way back up to the top through six loans over three years before becoming an integral part of Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 superb Swansea City team.</p> <p>But when two brilliant seasons in south Wales earned him a return to the top, via a \xc2\xa36.2m move to City, he again failed to impose himself and his career has stalled over the past two and a half years. Now he has played a couple of games full of vim and brio, dash and determination, so Villa may find out whether Sinclair, at 25, has the mettle to maintain this level at a time when they most need talented characters.

Only once previously have Hull won three Premier League matches in succession, when in their first couple of months as a top flight club back in 2008 they collected all 12 points on offer against Arsenal, Tottenham, West Ham and West Brom. Richard Gibson</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Hull City 2-1 QPR \xe2\x80\xa2 Diam\xc3\xa9 comeback for Hull delayed after knock in training \xe2\x80\xa2 Amy Lawrence: Ramsey enjoys spotlight at QPR after years in shadows</p>  10) There\xe2\x80\x99s no point arguing with referees <p>Sunderland had two contentious calls go against them during Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s 0-0 home draw with West Brom. If the referee\xe2\x80\x99s decision to merely issue a yellow, rather than a red card, to Joleon Lescott probably proved correct \xe2\x80\x93 as Lescott arguably wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the last man when he fouled Danny Graham and contact was minimal \xe2\x80\x93 the subsequent disallowing of Adam Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s first-half goal for a perceived offside was much more controversial. Even so there was no point in Sunderland players \xe2\x80\x93 Seb Larsson in particular \xe2\x80\x93 continually haranguing Mike Jones regarding those decisions. This was not the generally underrated Larsson\xe2\x80\x99s best game, with his often reliable set-piece delivery unusually wonky \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps he was distracted by all the pointless arguing.</p> <p>More alarmingly, Larsson motioned Jermain Defoe over to him for a quiet word before a first-half Sunderland corner. From that set piece Defoe then seemed to deliberately provoke Claudio Yacob into a confrontation. Now Yacob is no shrinking violet and had been holding the striker at corners but he was furious to receive a talking to from the referee following that particular dead ball. Was it all a Sunderland ploy to try and get a card-prone player into serious trouble?</p> <p>Quite simply sniping at referees \xe2\x80\x93 not to mention the possible gamesmanship we saw at the corner \xe2\x80\x93 distracts from the control and concentration required to defeat a team as awkward as Tony Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s West Brom. On a similar theme Steve McClaren is on to something in banning swearing at Derby County \xe2\x80\x93 that sort of discipline can only enhance performances.
