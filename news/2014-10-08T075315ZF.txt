b'Football transfer rumours: Arturo Vidal to Manchester United (again)?'


b'<p>All been there, haven\xe2\x80\x99t we? Heavy old night, every bad idea starts to look like a resoundingly excellent one, you roll in at 5am and turn up to work late, looking like a state. And it\xe2\x80\x99s all OK because you\xe2\x80\x99ve done what\xe2\x80\x99s needed \xe2\x80\x93 you\xe2\x80\x99re now being linked with a big-money move to Manchester United. As it happens, the Mill can\xe2\x80\x99t relate to each and every element of this \xe2\x80\x93 we scrub up fine, considering \xe2\x80\x93 but one man who can is Arturo Vidal.</p> <p>The Chilean firebrand reportedly enjoyed a bit too much of la vida loca last Thursday night, apparently causing him to roll up at training late and attracting the ire of his manager at Juventus, Massimiliano Allegri, who promptly dropped him to the bench for the biggest match of this season\xe2\x80\x99s Serie A so far. Juve won it 3-2 against Roma, Vidal gracing proceedings for the final 11 minutes, but the biggest effect of the midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s night on the tiles has been to reignite the summer\xe2\x80\x99s ever-so-interesting stories linking him with a move to Manchester United. Will Juve perform a volte-face and allow him to leave in light of his indiscretions? Is Vidal, after all, the man to give Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s midfield the box-to-box presence it craves? Is this all two plus two equals five? No idea, but the lights in here are just a little too bright this morning.</p> <p>Prefer your rumours more wholesomely wrought? For something less bacchanalian, no bar tabs were harmed in the making of suggestions that Ramires could swap Chelsea for Real Madrid in a knock-on effect of any outgoing transfer of Sami Khedira, another of those mooted deals that you\xe2\x80\x99d hoped would be swept under the table after a long, long pre-season.</p> <p>Another Mill favourite, Marco Reus, is back on the radar, although with something of a longer game in mind. Manchester City are said to have stolen a march on their rivals with an inquiry for the Borussia Dortmund winger and are prepared to make him their very own next summer.</p> <p>You want something new. We understand. Not new at all is that Harry Redknapp needs a striker. It\xe2\x80\x99s been that way since Bournemouth\xe2\x80\x99s infamously shot-shy 1983-84 season, apparently, and things are just as pressing now because QPR have scored only four Premier League goals so far this season. The man to change all that is apparently Emmanuel Adebayor, although you\xe2\x80\x99d hope the Loftus Road side have at least added a few more to their tally before Harry\xe2\x80\x99s old Spurs charge rocks up \xe2\x80\x93 apparently \xe2\x80\x93 in January. And who else might be in tow? The not-at-all-looking-to-leave-Toronto-FC Jermain Defoe, so the story goes.</p> <p>And watch out, world \xe2\x80\x93 another chequebook-wielding veteran will be causing consternation in the aisles over the winter. Neil Warnock will receive the fabled war chest as Crystal Palace look to establish themselves among the elite, although there are limits to chairman Steve Parish\xe2\x80\x99s largesse: he\xe2\x80\x99d like Warnock to focus on players who have been undergoing sticky patches elsewhere and might be available in bargain deals.</p> <p>More? More. It looks as if Petr Cech\xe2\x80\x99s time at Chelsea may be drawing to a close after a decade in west London. Unable to break past Thibaut Courtois between the sticks, Cech the Czech will check out of Stamford Bridge if things don\xe2\x80\x99t change pretty darn quickly.</p> <p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve also heard a rumour that Roy Keane has a book out, but that just sounds a little far-fetched. Back to bed.</p>'
