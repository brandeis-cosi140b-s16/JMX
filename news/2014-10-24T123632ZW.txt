b'West Ham United v Manchester City: match preview'


b'<p>A critical and very difficult match for City, who crave a win in the early kick-off to edge closer to Chelsea before the league leaders\xe2\x80\x99 game at Old Trafford. City were guilty of slipping into slackness in the second half of their Champions League clash with CSKA Moscow in midweek, and West Ham are as capable as the Russians of punishing them if they relapse. West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s defence has been excellent all season but the in-form Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero will give them their biggest test; though in Diafra Sakho and Enner Valenica, the Hammers have top strikers of their own. A fascinating contest is in store.
