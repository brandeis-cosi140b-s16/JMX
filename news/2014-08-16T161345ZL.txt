b'<p>The new season is only one game old but the problems are already mounting for Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez.</p> <p>With the Everton manager hoping to go one better than last year and break into the promised land of the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s top four, the news that Ross Barkley\xe2\x80\x99s knee injury could keep the England midfielder out of action for several months was about as welcome as Chris Wood\xe2\x80\x99s equaliser four minutes from time which earned Leicester a point on their return to the top flight after a decade\xe2\x80\x99s absence.</p> <p>Barkley will have further scans on the medial knee ligament injury he picked up in training and despite a brilliant finish from his replacement in the No10 role, Steven Naismith, Mart\xc3\xadnez will be praying the prognosis on his young star is not as bad as feared.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe problem is with his medial ligament in his knee and we don\xe2\x80\x99t know how bad it is,\xe2\x80\x9d the Spaniard said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt could be between seven weeks or four or five months. But however long he is out for, we need to make sure we react as a team. Of course, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to miss him a lot. He was looking so sharp in pre-season and we were so unlucky to lose him to an innocuous challenge in training. Now he\xe2\x80\x99s going to be out for a long, long time.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>All the talk before this match was about the full debuts of two new strikers costing a total of \xc2\xa336m, although it was Leonardo Ulloa, Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa38m signing from Brighton, who found his way on to the scoresheet when he equalised within two minutes of Aiden McGeady\xe2\x80\x99s spectacular opener, before Naismith restored the lead just before half-time.</p> <p>Mart\xc3\xadnez was full of praise for \xc2\xa328m Romelu Lukaku as the Belgian striker made his full debut having spent last season on loan from Chelsea, although the 21-year-old looks well short of match practice after featuring in his country\xe2\x80\x99s run to the quarter-finals in Brazil.</p> <p>Despite the arrival of the Argentinian Ulloa also for a club record fee, it was Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s Thai owner, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, whose face adorned the matchday programme on their return to the top flight. He has stated in the past his target to see Leicester compete with the top clubs in the country within five years, although for now it seems he will be content with mere survival given the length of time it has taken them to escape the Championship.</p> <p>On paper, Nigel Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s side looks like it lacks the required experience to survive at this level yet a spirited comeback in the second half that culminated in Wood\xe2\x80\x99s smartly taken finish showed that they will have half a chance. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nice to get something out of the game having gone behind twice,\xe2\x80\x9d Pearson said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was an element of misfortune from our point of view about both but it would have been easy to think things weren\xe2\x80\x99t going our way so I\xe2\x80\x99m really pleased with the way we responded. We\xe2\x80\x99ll need to improve in certain areas but the biggest message from today is that even when we have injuries we are capable of getting a result against quality sides.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>For Mart\xc3\xadnez, it was definitely a case of two points dropped. Even with a strong bench featuring new signings Muhamed Besic and Christian Atsu which should help ease the loss of Barkley, the manager accepted that he could have done more to secure the three points.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe should have won but it is only us to blame,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe controlled the environment of playing a newly promoted side well and went ahead but we should have gone for the third goal rather than just trying to hold on. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t show the concentration levels that are needed. It\xe2\x80\x99s disappointing to concede a goal so late.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Wood could easily have found himself back in the Championship without having kicked a ball in anger but Wolves had a bid for him rejected. However, Pearson insisted he is going nowhere and, on the evidence of his cool finish past Tim Howard, you can see why. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s staying. I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to Chris on a couple of occasions this week and he is happy to stay,\xe2\x80\x9d said the manager.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt can be unsettling for any individual to be involved in speculation about his future but I\xe2\x80\x99m very pleased he was able to play his part in securing our first Premier League point of the season.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
