b'Football transfer rumours: Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s Chris Smalling to Arsenal?'


b'<p>On Tuesday, the Manchester United defender Phil Jones was in fine form, roaring and gurning in equal measure as he addressed those who have criticised him and his fellow defender Chris Smalling. These are the edited highlights: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have proved people wrong \xe2\x80\xa6 people criticising does spur you on \xe2\x80\xa6 you are always going to get critics,\xe2\x80\x9d he howled, before describing the precise body parts necessary for the modern footballer to use in sticking one to the naysayers. \xe2\x80\x9cWe just take it on the chin, it is water off a duck\xe2\x80\x99s back.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger has taken note of the fact that Smalling has become used to handling criticism and reckons that makes him the perfect man to shore up Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s defence, a place where he can put his newfound disparagement-deflection skills to a proper test. He\xe2\x80\x99s readying a \xc2\xa312m bid and is willing to throw in a duck should Smalling need the bird to deflect any water that comes his way as a consequence.</p> <p>Meanwhile Chuba Akpom, about whom the Mill has spent a difficult 10 minutes weighing up the merits of a brass instrument/Star Wars wookie pun before bailing out on both, is off to Nottingham Forest on loan for the rest of the season.</p> <p>That wailing noise in Manchester is the sound of Radamel Falcao having a good sob. Following the news that four goals in 19 appearances is not really good enough to earn him a permanent stay at Old Trafford, the striker has been tearfully phoning his old agent Silviano Espindola. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not going to tell you that he feels happy because he isn\xe2\x80\x99t. We speak many times and we cry together,\xe2\x80\x9d sniffed Espindola. Joining Falcao in the club\xe2\x80\x99s hot, salty tears department are Jonny Evans and Javier Hern\xc3\xa1ndez who are currently in the process of finding their hooks so that they can sling them.</p> <p>Manchester United were feeling quite chipper about their chances of signing Porto\xe2\x80\x99s full-back Danilo from under Real Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s noses last night. The fact that the man in question parped \xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing of any offer from Real Madrid\xe2\x80\x9d was a considerable boon to the Old Trafford suits. That he then spoke to Spanish daily AS and said \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m prepared\xe2\x80\x9d and happy to go to Madrid, however, has somewhat blown that out of the water.</p> <p>Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Petr Cech has removed his helmet and donned a pair of spectacles so that he can better eye the exit door at Stamford Bridge. Should a sack containing \xc2\xa310m be deposited in Roman Abramovich\xe2\x80\x99s bank account, he will be aboard the good ship Do One \xe2\x80\x93 destination Arsenal or Real Madrid \xe2\x80\x93 by the end of the season. Chelsea, meanwhile, are keeping tabs on the Lazio forward Felipe Anderson, whose recent form has not been hampered by having that aforementioned packet of cigarettes on his head.</p> <p>On being handed a large shatterproof ruler, the Everton forward Steven Naismith has refused to rule out the words \xe2\x80\x9creturn to Rangers\xe2\x80\x9d on a big piece of paper in front of him. Although, reading his quotes a little more closely, he actually said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d never rule anything out to be honest,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning his rule-based refusal policy is actually a far broader strategy than first thought.</p> <p>And the rest: the on-loan Southampton defender Toby Alderweireld wants to join Tottenham because he wants to play with Jan Vertonghen again. Hmm. Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Jos\xc3\xa9 Enrique has been swimming with dolphins and, for our money, has been getting a bit too cuddly with them. Finally, Louis van Gaal is at least set to win one thing this season: an award from the Dutch Judo Association, of course!</p>'
