b'THE FIVER COOKS VILLA\xe2\x80\x99S PREMIER LEAGUE GOOSE, BY WISHING TIM SHERWOOD ALL THE BEST <p>Everyone likes to see a big club get relegated, it\xe2\x80\x99s the best part of football. What would be more satisfying than watching, say, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur all slipping down the divisions in the next couple of seasons? Nothing, that\xe2\x80\x99s what! (Though we\xe2\x80\x99d need at least Nottingham Forest and Nasty Leeds to finally come back up, so The Fiver still has some people to project its barely concealed feelings of inadequacy on to.) So most people, it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to assume, will be fervently hoping to see relegation-haunted Aston Villa drop down to the second division. Nothing against the midlands giants per se, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t have Big Cup on your CV if you want people to prefer you over Burnley, that\xe2\x80\x99s just the way things work. They\xe2\x80\x99ve made their bed, and now they\xe2\x80\x99re thrashing about in it, crying. We have empathy.</p> <p>Anyway, The Fiver had been firmly in this behemoth-baiting camp, waiting eagerly and impatiently for Villa to be reduced to second-tier status for the first time since 1987. And then something strange happened. Tim Sherwood became their manager. And there he is, being patronised to within an inch of his life by all and sundry for \xe2\x80\xa6 well, what, exactly? Talking himself up in a few press conferences? Well, who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, and the man needed a job. Doing that cheesy oh-captain-my-captain routine with Emmanuel Adebayor during his time at Spurs? Hey, The Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s a sucker for showy sentimentality, and what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with being nice and having a bit of fun. Celebrating goals by sprinting up and down the touchline like an ITV2 Mourinho? Well, what would folks rather he do, sit in the dugout with a grim look on his coupon, pompously scribbling in a notepad, pretending he\xe2\x80\x99s above it all?</p> <p>The poor man\xe2\x80\x99s not even been allowed to wear a coat without getting it in the neck. So come on Tim. And you\xe2\x80\x99ll have needed a heart of stone, or a season ticket at the Hawthorns or St Andrews, not to have been pleased for Sherwood on Tuesday night when West Brom keeper Ben Foster suffered a thundering nervous breakdown at Villa Park and gifted the hosts a precious injury-time victory. And a richly deserved one, given Villa were two goalline clearances and the width of a post away from taking a 4-0 half-time lead. The win ended a sequence of seven straight league defeats, and Sherwood ostentatiously checked his pulse at the final whistle. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I left home my wife said she\xe2\x80\x99d done the Euro lottery with a \xc2\xa354m jackpot but I said I\xe2\x80\x99d take three points all the way,\xe2\x80\x9d he later simpered, hamming it up all the way. And good for him, for suddenly those points have catapulted Villa three clear of the drop zone, only one behind Sunderland, and a mere three behind Everton.

As a fan of a lower-league team, I\xe2\x80\x99m full of rage \xe2\x80\x93 you could say I\xe2\x80\x99m overcome with emulsion\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Patrick Brennan.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMay I be the first among up-to-date pedants to inform Graham Haslam that his pedantry (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letter) comes literally far too late and that he will have to literally apologise to all those children he has unjustly maligned. Only last year the pedant\xe2\x80\x99s Bible, The Oxford English Dictionary, put the rubber stamp on acceptance of the non-literal use of literally. It is therefore now entirely correct to use the word \xe2\x80\x98literally\xe2\x80\x99 as an emphasiser in the sense of \xe2\x80\x98especially\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98particularly\xe2\x80\x99 and as \xe2\x80\x98very\xe2\x80\x99 can be used with those two words it can certainly be used legitimately, if a little inelegantly, with \xe2\x80\x98literally\xe2\x80\x99 in that sense. I am, of course, not for one second suggesting that The Fiver knew that!

I took it up last year and it is a very challenging and rewarding sport.
