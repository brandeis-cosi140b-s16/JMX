b"Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho strongly defends Chelsea style against 'boring' criticism"


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho says Roman Abramovich is very happy with the style in which Chelsea have moved to the verge of a first Premier League title in five years and the manager is dismissive of the modern-day trend to assess a team\xe2\x80\x99s flair purely in terms of how much possession they have.</p> <p>He argued that the most recent criticism of the team, who are 10 points clear at the top of the division, was rooted in the emphasis placed on ball retention with the game\xe2\x80\x99s basic requirement \xe2\x80\x93 to outscore the opposition \xe2\x80\x93 apparently overlooked.</p> <p>Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s defence of the way his side play followed the goalless draw at Arsenal on Sunday when home supporters bellowed a chorus of \xe2\x80\x9cboring, boring Chelsea\xe2\x80\x9d. John Terry subsequently praised his team\xe2\x80\x99s resilience \xe2\x80\x93 they have not trailed in a league game since New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day \xe2\x80\x93 and suggested \xe2\x80\x9ctippy-tappy football\xe2\x80\x9d alone was not enough to claim titles. Mourinho echoed his captain\xe2\x80\x99s comments and takes comfort in Abramovich\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction with the side\xe2\x80\x99s progress.</p> <p>The club\xe2\x80\x99s owner, who craves an expansive style of play, has attended their past three matches and he visited the away dressing room at the Emirates Stadium to congratulate the players after a result that left Chelsea within five points of the title. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is very happy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw him hugging the players in the dressing room after the game and, yes, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s happy and I think every Chelsea fan is happy if we win the title. If we do, we will have had a fantastic Premier League season.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Much of the flak has been a reaction to the more pragmatic approach adopted by Mourinho since suspensions and injuries disrupted his first-choice XI \xe2\x80\x93 the leading scorer Diego Costa, for example, may not be risked until the weekend \xe2\x80\x93 but that will not take any of the sheen off the achievement that awaits if they beat Leicester City and Crystal Palace in the next five days. Mourinho has rejected suggestions his team, who have topped the division since the opening round of fixtures, are boring and has consistently pointed to the fact that only Manchester City have scored more goals, 70 in 34 league games to Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s 65 in 33.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPeople talk about style and flair but what is that?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes I ask myself about the future, and maybe the future of football is a beautiful, green grass carpet without goals, where the team with more ball possession wins the game. The way people analyse style and flair is to take the goals off the pitch. It\xe2\x80\x99s the football they play on the moon \xe2\x80\x93 where the surface is not good, with some holes but no goals.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone speaks about teams playing fantastically well because they \xe2\x80\x98had great ball possession\xe2\x80\x99. It looks like the goals aren\xe2\x80\x99t important. They conclude a team that scores as many as we do is boring but a team with 70% of the ball who don\xe2\x80\x99t score isn\xe2\x80\x99t. Maybe, when my grandsons play, football will be a game without goals and we\xe2\x80\x99ll just enjoy people passing the ball. But when football is played without goals, you will say it\xe2\x80\x99s boring. You will say bring the goals back. For me, it\xe2\x80\x99s still about putting the ball in your opponents\xe2\x80\x99 net, and keeping it out of your own.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho claimed the apparent change in emphasis was down to \xe2\x80\x9csome managers who can only teach their guys to keep the ball\xe2\x80\x9d. He rejected the notion his departure from Chelsea in 2007 had been partly due to Abramovich\xe2\x80\x99s frustration that the team were not playing with the swagger of a Barcelona. \xe2\x80\x9cFor me, the \xe2\x80\x98beautiful game\xe2\x80\x99 is to go to every match knowing exactly the way you have to play and what you have to do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAt Arsenal we were brilliant. Brilliant. A game where we were brilliant from the first minute.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cUs boring? It cannot be true. It\xe2\x80\x99s all about establishing the criteria. Who scored the most beautiful goals in the Premier League? If that is a criteria, Chelsea did it collectively [with Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle\xe2\x80\x99s goal at Burnley in August]. If the concept is the number of goals, City scored more than us. But 18 teams scored fewer than us, so there are 18 teams who are more boring than us. Do you think, in the Premier League, there is one manager who will say that Chelsea don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to be champions? I think, out of the other 19 managers, the huge percentage will say Chelsea deserve to win the league.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf a good team is the team with most points, we are the best team. If a good team is the team with most victories, we are the best team. If the best team are the side with fewest defeats, we are the best team. If the best team is the one that leads, we are the best team. If the best team is the side with fewest conceded, we are the second best team. In any criteria you can find, we are the best team or the second best team. It\xe2\x80\x99s as simple as that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
