b'Serie A this week: Napoli on fire, Genoa & Samp surging and  Mazzarri suffering'


b'  Serie A expert James Horncastle reacts to another win for Napoli, which pushes their unbeaten streak to seven games. They face Fiorentina on Sunday with a chance to get into the top three. Elsewhere, Genoa and Sampdoria have overcome tragedy to begin the season strongly while Inter\xe2\x80\x99s Walter Mazzarri is desperate for a victory over Verona this weekend with calls for Roberto Mancini to replace him growing stronger.     <p>After weeks of speculation regarding Rafa Ben\xc3\xadtez\xe2\x80\x99s job security at Napoli, on Saturday the clearest indication yet that the old Napoli are back was on full display. A 2-0 win against Roma at the San Paolo has put the Azzurri firmly back in the hunt for a European spot. Their success has a lot to do with the form of Jos\xc3\xa9 Callej\xc3\xb3n - Serie A\xe2\x80\x99s top scorer with eight goals - three of which have been assisted by Gonzalo Higua\xc3\xadn. That special combination sees Napoli aiming for third place when they take on Fiorentina this Sunday. </p>      Pos Team P GD Pts      3 Lazio 10 9 19    4 Sampdoria 10 6 19    5 Napoli 10 7 18    6 Genoa 10 4 18    7 AC Milan 10 4 16       <p>The tragic floods in Genoa are still fresh in the locals\xe2\x80\x99 minds but somehow, together with Sampdoria, the pair are combining for their highest positions after ten games since 1990-91. The last time Genoa took 18 points at this stage was back in 1932/33, while Sampdoria\xe2\x80\x99s coach Sini\xc5\xa1a Mihajlovi\xc4\x87 is establishing himself as one of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s brightest innovators. The two clubs can be proud of what they are achieving following the flash flooding that engulfed the city.</p>    <p>37 - Together @GenoaCFC and @sampdoria have collected 37 points so far: an all-time record in Serie A after the first 10 fixtures. Superba.</p>&mdash; OptaPaolo (@OptaPaolo) November 2, 2014    <p>Sampdoria have only lost once this season and their next opponents are AC Milan, a struggling outfit with just two points from their last three games. Despite scoring on his debut for the Rossoneri, Fernando Torres has failed to find the net since and it seems a change of scenery from Stamford Bridge to San Siro has done little to alter his fortunes. El Ni\xc3\xb1o said he left Chelsea because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel wanted enough, but this graphic suggests he isn\xe2\x80\x99t doing enough in Italy to be wanted there either. Torres is going up against a defence this weekend that has let in just six goals in 10 games thus far. </p>    <p>Adriano Galliani defends Fernando @Torres despite struggles in front of goal: http://t.co/oVB2CgyUhQ pic.twitter.com/srPXz1WBn9</p>&mdash; Goal (@goal_intl) October 31, 2014    <p>When delving deeper into the day-to-day routine of Andrea Pirlo, one would assume you would find him mastering the art of the free-kick. The Juventus playmaker made it 26 goals from free-kicks in his Serie A career against Empoli last weekend, then celebrated his 100th appearance in the Champions League in style with yet another against Olympiacos. Scoring on the century places Pirlo in the company of Thierry Henry, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Cristiano Ronaldo as the only players to do so, and that\xe2\x80\x99s now 20 goals from direct free-kicks since 2004/05 for the charismatic Italian. </p>    <p>Pirlo has not scored from a ball in open play in almost 3 years (17.03.2012 vs. Fiore). Since then 16 free kicks and 1 penalty</p>&mdash; MisterChip (English) (@MisterChiping) November 4, 2014    <p>Not a good week for Inter, who for the ninth time failed to win three games in a row under Walter Mazzarri. While that feat is hard to fathom and even harder to replicate, the fact that the defeat came at the hands of then-bottom Parma was even more concerning for Mazzarri, who is under serious pressure from fans to be replaced by Roberto Mancini. Inter face Verona on Sunday and a loss could be fatal for the manager, but why are the fans so hasty? Unless Milan supporters want their training ground to become a playground for churlish behaviour, they may wish for their fortunes to turn around and current boss to keep his job. </p>     Roberto Mancini in one of many training ground spats with Mario Balotelli Photograph: Eamonn &amp; James Clarke        Pos Team P GD Pts      1 Juventus 10 14 25    2 Roma 10 10 22    3 Lazio 10 9 19    4 Sampdoria 10 6 19    5 Napoli 10 7 18    6 Genoa 10 4 18    7 AC Milan 10 4 16    8 Udinese 10 0 16    9 Inter Milan 10 3 15    10 Fiorentina 10 1 13    11 Verona 10 -5 13    12 Torino 10 -2 12    13 Palermo 10 -6 12    14 Sassuolo 10 -5 11    15 Atalanta 10 -7 9    16 Cagliari 10 0 9    17 Empoli 10 -8 7    18 Cesena 10 -9 7    19 Parma 10 -9 6    20 Chievo 10 -9 5     '
