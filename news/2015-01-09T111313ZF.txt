b'<p>Frank Lampard has moved to clarify the confusion over his move to New York City FC, issuing a statement in which he describes some of the speculation over his current position as \xe2\x80\x9clies and nonsense\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>The Premier League confirmed on Thursday that Manchester City have not broken any rules regarding Frank Lampard\xe2\x80\x99s contract extension and stated that there is no agreement in place between the club or its owners and New York City FC over his registration.</p> <p>The midfielder was expected to join the new MLS side this month following what City originally described as a short \xe2\x80\x9cloan\xe2\x80\x9d period at the Etihad for the first five months of the Premier League campaign, a move that has since been extended until the end of the season.</p> <p>But Lampard, who has scored five goals in 15 Premier League appearances for Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s side this season, has insisted he signed his agreement with NYCFC and intends to honour it after the English season is over.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI want to make it completely clear about my situation as I have read a lot of lies and nonsense over the last few days,\xe2\x80\x9d read Lampard\xe2\x80\x99s statement.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen released from Chelsea last year at the end of my contract I signed a commitment to play in NYCFC for two years starting January 1st 2015. I was then offered the chance to train and be a part of the Man City squad in the interim to keep myself in the best shape going into New York.</p>  <p> Related: Manchester City have \xe2\x80\x98no agreement with New York\xe2\x80\x99 over Frank Lampard </p>   <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis period has since been extended by Man City and I will now start playing for NYCFC at the end of this current Premier League season. There has always been a constant dialogue between all parties in this time to find the best solution for everyone.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI can say that I am very excited about arriving in New York and giving everything to the team to make us a success in the MLS as soon as possible. Thanks everyone for your ongoing support and I wish everyone a healthy and happy 2015.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Having left Chelsea at the end of last season, in July, New York City were clear that they had signed Lampard, declaring on their website: \xe2\x80\x9cNew York City FC signs Frank Lampard to a Designated Player contract \xe2\x80\xa6 a two-year contract which starts August 1st.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Only a month later City said Lampard would arrive \xe2\x80\x9con loan\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 although that online announcement has since been removed despite Lampard referencing \xe2\x80\x9cloan\xe2\x80\x9d in media interviews.</p>'
