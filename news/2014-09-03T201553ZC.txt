b'Czech Republic 0-1 USA - as it happened'


b'<p>Final thoughts</p> <p>So not quite the game we were expecting then, though lots of positives for the US in particular. Joe Gyau did his case no harm with a lively attacking performance in the first half, while the midfield in that opening 45 looked more like the home side than the Czechs as they dominated the game. </p> <p>Inevitably the substitutions changed the game and the resulting lack of cohesion was exploited by the Czech team as they finally committed more men forward in the second half, and as Rosicky grew in influence towards the end. Still no win for Vrba though, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll want ot forget that first half when the Netherlands arrive next week.</p> <p>Despite the second half pressure, the US young guns held out for a nice win and some valuable experience, while also serving up the rather interesting subplot of Nick Rimando having a great second half to keep his team in it and to leave more of an impression than Brad Guzan, who in fairness had nothing much to do in the first half. Guzan still surely the incumbent number one on Howard\xe2\x80\x99s absence, but Rimando certainly keeping him honest with tonight\xe2\x80\x99s performance. </p> <p>Thanks for joining me this afternoon. See you again next time.</p>'
