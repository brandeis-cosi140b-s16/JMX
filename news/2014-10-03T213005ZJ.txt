b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho: Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas was the perfect addition for Chelsea'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has described Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas as a \xe2\x80\x9cperfect\xe2\x80\x9d addition to Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s ranks and believes the Spaniard is relishing life in new surroundings as he prepares to confront his former club, Arsenal, for the first time since returning to the Premier League.</p> <p>F\xc3\xa0bregas made 306 appearances for the north London club after initially joining their academy from Barcelona as a 16-year-old. He eventually agitated successfully for a move back to Camp Nou, completed in 2011, before resuming his career in England this summer following a \xc2\xa330m move to Chelsea, and his impact has been immediate. The World Cup winner has already supplied six assists for his new team, operating impressively in a deep-lying midfield brief and thriving in supplying the prolific Diego Costa.</p> <p>The midfielder retains a strong affection for Arsenal, an affinity with which Mourinho is comfortable ahead of this derby, though he is already settled at the club having moved into the enclave of Chelsea players living close to the club\xe2\x80\x99s Cobham training ground. \xe2\x80\x9cHe loves Chelsea already,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Portuguese. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s so happy: the way he plays, the way he\xe2\x80\x99s a member of the squad, the way he lives in this little blue village. It is like he\xe2\x80\x99s here for a long time. If you ask him now if he regrets the move, I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99d say no. If you ask him if he\xe2\x80\x99d choose a different option [if given the chance], he\xe2\x80\x99d say no. And if you ask him where he thinks he\xe2\x80\x99ll be in five years\xe2\x80\x99 time, he\xe2\x80\x99d say he sees himself here in five years\xe2\x80\x99 time. He is Chelsea.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not about him \xe2\x80\x98replacing\xe2\x80\x99 Arsenal in his heart. He\xe2\x80\x99ll never lose that respect and connection with a club where he arrived as a kid and left as a top player. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be happy if he came here saying: \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about Arsenal; my life at Arsenal is over, I forget everything; now it\xe2\x80\x99s just about Chelsea.\xe2\x80\x99 I don\xe2\x80\x99t like that approach. Many times, when a player says things like that, it\xe2\x80\x99s not true. And if it is true, it\xe2\x80\x99s also not good. So I\xe2\x80\x99m completely happy with his approach.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAfter Chelsea I worked for Internazionale and Real Madrid and I never stopped saying Chelsea were my club and that I wanted to come back one day. But I gave everything to Inter and Real. F\xc3\xa0bregas doesn\xe2\x80\x99t forget Arsenal, the time he spent there, the contribution it made in his fantastic career, and that deserves a place in his memory and his heart. And the fact he\xe2\x80\x99s giving everything to Chelsea with such professionalism and enthusiasm is exactly what we want of him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Arsenal had first refusal to re-sign F\xc3\xa0bregas when it became clear the player wanted to leave Barcelona this summer \xe2\x80\x93 he felt opportunities in the first team at Camp Nou would be more limited \xe2\x80\x93 but chose not to exercise that option having secured Mesut \xc3\x96zil in the interim. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger claimed the player\xe2\x80\x99s preference was to return to the Emirates Stadium. \xe2\x80\x9cBut when Cesc left we bought \xc3\x96zil to buy an offensive player,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have [Santi] Cazorla, we have [Jack] Wilshere, we have [Aaron] Ramsey, we have [Alex] Oxlade-Chamberlain, who are all offensive players. We were not in the need to buy offensive players.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOnce he went to Barcelona, he could have gone anywhere else after. I personally believe that deal [with Chelsea] was done a long time ago, early 2014. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak to Cesc directly. I was informed that he might go to Chelsea, but when I was informed I thought the deal was already done. Everybody has the freedom to go where they want. We have to respect their decisions. But we were in search of more up front and more defensive opportunities than creative midfielders. We have many. I wish him well. He is a great player and a person and player I love. Once he left us, he left us. We are all professionals and we have to accept that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>F\xc3\xa0bregas retains the ability to wound his former employers on Sunday having slotted in seamlessly to Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s lineup as a supply-line for Costa \xe2\x80\x93 who will start the match \xe2\x80\x93 and his new team\xe2\x80\x99s forward line. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted him because I know the player he is,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I know he was good for the philosophy we wanted for the team. I knew that he\xe2\x80\x99s one of not many players who can play as a No8 or a No10, so he gives me chances to play him in both positions and build a midfield knowing that.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that he was made in England and played for so many years in English football \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s a plus. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need that adaptation. He comes back home. We knew he was the perfect for us. We tried. We tried hard, and we succeeded. But every game so far, without exception, he has been phenomenal for us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
