b'Bristol Academy\xe2\x80\x99s tough test against Frankfurt in Champions League'


b'<p>At the end of a week when so much attention has focused on where it all went wrong for Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool in the Champions League, it is worth remembering there is still one English team flying the flag. Bristol Academy, conquerors of Barcelona in the previous round, host Frankfurt at Ashton Gate on Saturday in the first leg of their Women\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League quarter-final.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s surprising how many people don\xe2\x80\x99t know that we\xe2\x80\x99re playing in the quarter-final of the Champions League, yet you flip it to the men\xe2\x80\x99s game and everyone knows that Arsenal went out on away goals on Tuesday night,\xe2\x80\x9d Grace McCatty, Bristol\xe2\x80\x99s captain, says with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is nice for us to get some recognition, not just in and around Bristol but nationally, because I do think we deserve it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As the only Women\xe2\x80\x99s Super League 1 team not affiliated to a professional men\xe2\x80\x99s club, it is quite an achievement for Bristol to reach the last eight. Nobody gave Dave Edmondson\xe2\x80\x99s side much of a chance when they drew Barcelona in the last 16, yet Bristol ended their 55-match unbeaten home record and triumphed 2-1 on aggregate after a 1-1 draw in front of 2,500 at Ashton Gate in the second leg in November. \xe2\x80\x9cBristol beat Barcelona, you don\xe2\x80\x99t hear that much in football,\xe2\x80\x9d McCatty says, laughing.</p> <p>Frankfurt, however, represent a step up in class again. Edmondson talks about a team \xe2\x80\x9cstacked with absolute superstars\xe2\x80\x9d, highlights the fact that they have won the Champions League three times and says that if Bristol go through it will go down as one of the biggest upsets in the history of women\xe2\x80\x99s football. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only way I can explain it is, their manager has just signed a new contract and if they don\xe2\x80\x99t beat us, I would be amazed if he\xe2\x80\x99s still there,\xe2\x80\x9d Edmondson says. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we win, it would be like Yeovil beating Manchester United [in the men\xe2\x80\x99s game].\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Not that Bristol\xe2\x80\x99s manager is resigned to defeat. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got a gameplan, a style of play that can beat Frankfurt. It will need everyone having their best game, which was the case in the last half-hour of the home tie against Barcelona. We\xe2\x80\x99ll need that from everyone for 90 minutes against Frankfurt.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Yet so much has changed in the four months since that Barcelona tie, which is the last competitive match Bristol played because the domestic season in England runs from the end of March until October. Five of the Bristol side that featured against Barcelona have moved on, including last season\xe2\x80\x99s leading scorer, Natalia Pablos-Sanch\xc3\xb3n, who has joined Arsenal along with Jemma Rose. Natasha Harding, another of Bristol\xe2\x80\x99s most talented players last year, has signed for Manchester City.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve lost five or six players and that\xe2\x80\x99s down to finance, pure and simple,\xe2\x80\x9d Edmondson says. \xe2\x80\x9cMy entire playing budget for the year is \xc2\xa3100,000. Manchester City are giving one player \xc2\xa370,000. And it\xe2\x80\x99s not one player that is getting \xc2\xa370,000 and everyone else is on peanuts.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>While Bristol may not be able to compete financially with Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool and City \xe2\x80\x93 whom Edmondson also makes a point of praising for \xe2\x80\x9cpromoting women\xe2\x80\x99s football really well\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 the club have other strings to their bow. A partnership with South Gloucestershire and Stroud college allows the players to make use of the excellent sport facilities on a \xc2\xa330m campus. There is also a centre of excellence and a female football development programme that enables those aged 16-19 to combine studies with playing.</p> <p>McCatty came through that system. \xe2\x80\x9cI think one thing that Bristol deserve so much credit for is that they place a huge value on developing younger players, and that probably to an extent comes down to the budget,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look at the current team, there is myself, Jasmine Matthews, Nikki Watts and Sharla [Passariello] who are all products of our 16-19 academy. Any young player who wants to play at the highest level, I would 100% recommend coming to Bristol because there is a pathway.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Whether further opportunities open up through being part of the Bristol Sport stable, which is owned by the billionaire Steve Lansdown and includes Bristol Rugby and Bristol City, remains to be seen. At the moment Bristol Academy rely heavily on a couple of sponsors for financial support as well as funding from the Football Association.</p> <p>Many of Edmondson\xe2\x80\x99s players work full-time which means that three of Bristol\xe2\x80\x99s four training sessions in the week have to take place from 7.30pm-9.30pm. With all the travelling it is a big commitment for relatively little financial reward. Yet as Mary Earps, Bristol\xe2\x80\x99s goalkeeper and a Loughborough University student, points out, getting the chance to play in a Champions League quarter-final makes all the sacrifices worthwhile, even if the task ahead is a daunting one. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone says to me on Twitter or Facebook or in text messages: \xe2\x80\x98Just keep a clean sheet, Mary, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.\xe2\x80\x99 Not a problem. They\xe2\x80\x99ve only got almost the entire German national team, including [Celia] Sasic, the girl who scored two past England when they beat them 3-0 in November,\xe2\x80\x9d she says.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAll jokes aside, we know that they\xe2\x80\x99re a good team but we also know what it felt like to beat Barcelona. And we\xe2\x80\x99re going to chase that feeling again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
