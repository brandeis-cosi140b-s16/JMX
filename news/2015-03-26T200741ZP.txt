b'Premier League promises to share \xc2\xa31bn of TV deal with English football'


b'<p>The Premier League has moved to head off its critics by promising at least \xc2\xa31bn of its bumper \xc2\xa35bn domestic TV deal will be redistributed outside the top flight and committing all clubs to pay staff the living wage.</p> <p>Following the first meeting of the 20 top-flight clubs since Sky and BT Sport agreed to pay \xc2\xa35.14bn for domestic live rights from 2016-17, the chief executive, Richard Scudamore, said they had committed to redistribute at least \xc2\xa350m each over three seasons.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis is unprecedented in world sport. You can\xe2\x80\x99t find me another sport that is committed to this level of sharing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Scudamore, who will become executive chairman under a board shakeup also confirmed at the meeting. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s sharing in the success of English football. And this, in my view, is the right thing to do.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He outlined five areas in which the money would be invested but said it was too early to say how much each would receive until overseas deals, which could take the total to \xc2\xa38.5bn, were negotiated over the rest of the year.</p> <p>The \xc2\xa31bn \xe2\x80\x93 likely to represent a rise of at least 40% in cash terms on the current deal \xe2\x80\x93 includes money given to relegated clubs in the form of parachute payments and so-called solidarity payments to the Football League and Conference. However, it will also include increased investment in grassroots sport, facilities and fan engagement, including more money for the fund that clubs use to subsidise tickets and travel for away supporters.</p> <p>Whether that will be enough to satisfy fans\xe2\x80\x99 groups who protested outside the meeting on Piccadilly with a megaphone and banners to demand lower ticket prices remains to be seen. Among other things, the Football Supporters\xe2\x80\x99 Federation has called for a five-fold increase in the away fans\xe2\x80\x99 fund to \xc2\xa31m per club per year. However, Scudamore said ticket pricing would largely remain a matter for the clubs.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t deal with every issue the game has but I think this is a very significant decision the clubs have made,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile government funding for local authorities is chopped, while things are tight and others not as fortunate as us, everyone recognises we have a role to play in sharing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The UK domestic live deal was a 70% increase on the current contract but Scudamore said once international sales were factored in, the percentage uplift would be lower.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re doing this to a degree now but this is a big step change. For the clubs to commit this early to \xc2\xa31bn of this TV deal to be shared, it\xe2\x80\x99s a significant step,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd to sign up to the living wage for all 20 clubs this early, that is also significant.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Campaigners and MPs have been pressuring the 20 Premier League clubs to commit to paying the living wage, set at \xc2\xa39.15 an hour in London and \xc2\xa37.85 outside, but only Chelsea currently do so. Scudamore was stung by criticism over the issue after unveiling the bumper TV deal but clubs have now agreed to pay all full-time staff the living wage by the start of the 2016-17 season at the latest.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe clubs absolutely get that if you are paying players X, and X is a big number, it does look a little incongruous if you are only paying your employees Y. Hence the decision today and I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of them for making that decision.\xe2\x80\x9d However, the commitment extends only to full-time staff and not to the contractors who make up large swathes of the matchday workforce.</p> <p>The director of the living wage campaign, Rhys Moore, broadly welcomed the promise but said it should be extended to subcontractors such as matchday stewards and catering staff.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is definitely a move in the right direction. However, the vast majority of low-paid work in the Premier League is with subcontractors. This commitment doesn\xe2\x80\x99t address that, which is why we think living wage accreditation is so important,\xe2\x80\x9d said Moore.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe commitment Chelsea made to become the only accredited living wage employer in the Premier League goes so much further than this.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Scudamore would not be drawn on whether any of the extra money would help fund the FA chairman Greg Dyke\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa3230m plan for 150 new 3G pitches around the country, saying only it had remained committed to investing in facilities. In contrast, he said, the FA and the government had historically \xe2\x80\x9cchopped and chopped\xe2\x80\x9d their investment.</p> <p>Scudamore said he was unconcerned that there were no Premier League clubs in the quarter-finals of the Champions League for the second time in three seasons. He said his only measures of success were attendance and global viewing figures.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPeople like what we do. We\xe2\x80\x99ve never put false measures in that we must win X number of Champions Leagues,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOur matches, our top clubs, the viewing is going up and up around the world, irrespective of European success or otherwise. Interestingly, Champions League audiences don\xe2\x80\x99t do as well when our clubs aren\xe2\x80\x99t in it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Under the governance changes, the Premier League will have a board of three \xe2\x80\x93 with the addition of two non-executive directors for the first time in the Halfords director, Claudia Arney, and the Taylor Wimpey chairman, Kevin Beeston, who is a former Ipswich Town director.</p> <p>Scudamore defended his looming promotion from chief executive to executive chairman, which would be frowned upon under City regulatory guidance, on the basis that any major decisions are still put before the 20 clubs.</p> <p>He said the clubs should get more credit for the investment they make and argued the early commitment to the \xc2\xa31bn figure should help change perceptions.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe clubs never get enough credit for what they do. This is an element of them trying to get a bit of that ground back. There will be something people ought to be able to recognise. These are significant things and if we communicate properly, I do hope over time people will appreciate what we do.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
