b'Football transfer rumours: Gareth Bale going to Manchester United?'


b'<p>Gareth Bale\xe2\x80\x99s agent insists \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s not true he wants to return to the Premier League\xe2\x80\x9d and that instead \xe2\x80\x9che wants to continue to wear the Real Madrid jersey\xe2\x80\x9d and furthermore that \xe2\x80\x9crumours about a swap with Manchester United are absolute rubbish\xe2\x80\x9d. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to stop the enterprising British press, with Metro insisting Chelsea are \xe2\x80\x9cset to make a sensational offer\xe2\x80\x9d. And the Welshman might not be the only player soon to swap Madrid for London, with the \xc2\xa319m price tag recently placed on the head of Rapha\xc3\xabl Varane unlikely to deter either them or potential rival suitors Manchester United.</p> <p>United, though, have also been linked with other central defenders, including Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s Miranda, who would cost at least \xc2\xa31m more than Varane, we\xe2\x80\x99re told, despite already being the wrong side of 30, Borussia Dortmund\xe2\x80\x99s Mats Hummels, Athletic Bilbao\xe2\x80\x99s Aymeric Laporte and caveman-faced Dutchman Ron Vlaar.</p> <p>Talking of the Aston Villa defender, his agent has given the biggest hint yet that he is ready to leave the Midlands by, well, fairly explicitly saying that he wants to. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t respond to rumours,\xe2\x80\x9d he sniffed to the Sun. But, hey, rules are made to be broken, so he continued: \xe2\x80\x9cThe natural break for Ron is now. It\xe2\x80\x99s time to take the next step. He\xe2\x80\x99s ambitious. We have not spoken to Aston Villa [but] Ron is in a situation which is not unfavourable. We\xe2\x80\x99re in no hurry.\xe2\x80\x9d In the Mirror Arnold Oosterveer went even further, insisting \xe2\x80\x9cit is obvious that for Ron, now is the moment to make a nice big move in his career\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Also linked with a Manchester move this morning is Memphis Depay, the Holland winger whose manager at PSV Eindhoven, Phillip Cocu, has admitted that \xe2\x80\x9cof course he will be sold\xe2\x80\x9d. Cocu also says \xe2\x80\x9che can become way better\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cis so explosive\xe2\x80\x9d, the kind of excited chatter that makes it almost seem like he\xe2\x80\x99s got an interest in inflating the player\xe2\x80\x99s value.</p> <p>Back to Chelsea, though, and a \xe2\x80\x9cStamford Bridge insider\xe2\x80\x9d in no way simply made up by a journalist for the sake of convenience has revealed to the Sun that \xe2\x80\x9cPetr Cech has been linked with Real Madrid and PSG but there are also whispers about Manchester United and Liverpool. That\xe2\x80\x99s hardly surprising, a keeper of his class doesn\xe2\x80\x99t become available very often.\xe2\x80\x9d The player himself has meanwhile told Czech media that \xe2\x80\x9cas a player who has two years left on his contract, I cannot make choices. If the club says \xe2\x80\x98you are staying here\xe2\x80\x99 then I will be staying. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m staying.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Tottenham still want to sign Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s Morgan Schneiderlin and Jay Rodriguez, and will keep a cool \xc2\xa335m of their transfer budget unspent so they can swoop in the summer (which might be difficult if rumours of a \xc2\xa319.6m offer for Xherdan Shaqiri are to be believed). But the Saints are most worried about their rumoured intention to recruit their head of recruitment, Paul Mitchell.</p> <p>Internazionale want to sign Joel Campbell from Arsenal on loan, with a view to a \xc2\xa37m permanent move if they like each other. Joining him on the first plane from Heathrow to anywhere Italian could be Mauro Z\xc3\xa1rate, who\xe2\x80\x99s in a right huff about goings-on at Upton Park. \xe2\x80\x9cAt West Ham, Maurito is often used out of position by his coach and this is pushing us to think seriously of changing the team,\xe2\x80\x9d sobbed his agent, Luis Ruzzi. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a striker, a scorer, not a playmaker.\xe2\x80\x9d Potentially flying the other way is Claudio Marchisio, who has recently appeared on Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s radar. Apparently, and somewhat disappointingly, Juventus won\xe2\x80\x99t sell him.</p> <p>In an exclusive extract from his six-month-old autobiography, previously serialised in the Mail, I\xe2\x80\x99m a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here contestant Jimmy Bullard reveals in the Sun that Fabio Capello \xe2\x80\x9clooks like Postman Pat\xe2\x80\x9d and was so uninspiring \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had better coaching when I was playing non-league\xe2\x80\x9d. As for the midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s former club Fulham, they would like to bring back Chris Baird, who played 165 times for the Cottagers before leaving last year, moved to West Brom in the summer and has recently been used mainly as an occasional non-playing substitute.</p>'
