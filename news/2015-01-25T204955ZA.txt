b'<p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger says Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup giantkilling spree makes him reluctant to declare Arsenal favourites to win the trophy this season. His team\xe2\x80\x99s 3-2 victory at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion on Sunday made the holders the highest-placed Premier League team to reach the fifth round but the shock eliminations of Chelsea and Manchester City, plus Manchester United and Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s replays against lower league opposition, mean Wenger is not about to make predictions of glory.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAfter yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s results you would be a bit cautious,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wenger. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cup is the Cup. What we want is to focus on the next round and go through. Last season the most difficult games were not the expected ones. We will fight and we want to retain our Cup but it\xe2\x80\x99s too long to go to say [we are favourites].\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Wenger said the removal of five top-flight teams from the competition on Saturday had served as a \xe2\x80\x9csubconscious warning\xe2\x80\x9d to Arsenal not to lessen their focus for the trip to Brighton, a team in the bottom half of the Championship. That perhaps contributed to the vibrant start made by his side, who took the lead in the second minute through a goal from Theo Walcott. \xe2\x80\x9cThe shock results wake you up a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d Wenger added.</p>     Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger says Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s giantkillings had been a wake-up call for Arsenal at Brighton.

Wenger agreed that the performances of both players augured well for his team\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to compete hard not just in the FA Cup but also in the Premier League and Champions League, but stressed the need for his players to keep their focus. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have good momentum but let\xe2\x80\x99s keep the urgency level very high,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know that momentum can die in football if we drop a little bit in football. We have a good opportunity to finish well this season.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Arsenal expect to bolster their squad further by completing the signing of the Brazilian centre-back Gabriel Paulista from Villarreal. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99ll get it over the line overnight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wenger.</p>'
