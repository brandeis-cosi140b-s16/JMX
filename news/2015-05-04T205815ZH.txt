b'Hull City v Arsenal: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 live! | Nick Ames'


b'<p>Okay, that\xe2\x80\x99s us for tonight. Well deserved win for Arsenal, who did the job with those three goals fairly late in the first half. Hull huffed, puffed, should have scored early on and made things a bit interesting with that Quinn reply, but never looked like stepping things up much further. But we\xe2\x80\x99ve had fun and learned what flat-track bullies are \xe2\x80\x93 or aren\xe2\x80\x99t! \xe2\x80\x93 so the second 45 minutes was well worth tagging along for.</p> <p>Arsenal are level on points with second-placed Manchester City, two goals shy but with a game in hand. Hull remain a point clear of 18th-placed Sunderland, who have a game in hand themselves. All to play for. Thanks for your company, and goodnight.</p>'
