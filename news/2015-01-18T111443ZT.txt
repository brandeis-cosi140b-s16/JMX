b'The curious case of Phil Jones, the Manchester United corner taker | Marcus Christenson'


b'<p>There are many things to get angry about in life. Parking tickets, poor wi-fi, embarrassing parents and people standing right in front of you when you are trying to get off a tube train are only a few examples of what can ruin or at least semi-ruin a day. There is even one guy at the Guardian sports desk who seems annoyed when it rains.</p> <p>Yet it was still surprising to see the reaction around the world (yes around the world!) as word spread that Phil Jones was United\xe2\x80\x99s designated corner taker in the 2-0 win against Queens Park Rangers on Saturday. No sooner had Jones taken his first corner before Twitter went into overdrive.</p> <p>@retromanunited tweeted \xe2\x80\x9cJones taking corners, United have officially lost it, reminds me of Cleverley days \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d while @RFFH added: \xe2\x80\x9cNo matter what happens this game will be etched in history as the one where Phil Jones took a corner \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d @Samar7 went as far as saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to live in a world where Phil Jones is taking corner kicks\xe2\x80\x9d (OK, that\xe2\x80\x99s actually quite funny).</p> <p>Either way, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t Jones take Manchester United corners? Some might argue that he \xe2\x80\x93 with his height and physique \xe2\x80\x93 is better deployed in the area but he has only scored two goals in 116 Premier League matches and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think either of them came from a corner. Is it better to have Wayne Rooney taking the corners? Or \xc3\x81ngel Di Mar\xc3\xada? Probably not, as they are at least players who score goals when they get the ball in the area.</p>    <p>Imagine if Phil Jones had taken corners on David Moyes&#39; watch. pic.twitter.com/d3NQxY9xzu</p>&mdash; Back Page Football (@bpfootball) January 17, 2015    <p>The problem is that Jones is an easy target. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look like a player who should take corners. But then we live in a world where very few players seem to be good corner takers. United, for example, have scored three goals from 119 corners this season. Manchester City are even worse with two goals from 146 corners and Swansea and Aston Villa are the worst in the division with a paltry goal apiece all season from corners.</p> <p>Few have been as bad as Iago Aspas\xe2\x80\x99s effort for Liverpool against Chelsea last season but for United it does not really seem to matter who takes their corners \xe2\x80\x93 they are unlikely to score from them anyway.</p> <p>It is unclear whether this was just another attempt by Louis van Gaal to take everyone by surprise (as he did when he substituted his No1 goalkeeper, Jasper Cillessen, for Tim Krul in the last minute of extra time against Costa Rica in the World Cup quarter-final) but it is fair to say that it will probably be some time before we see Phil Jones take a corner again. And in a way that is a shame.</p> Top ten corner takers in the Premier League this season  <p>F\xc3\xa0bregas Chelsea 102</p> <p>Eriksen Tottenham Hotspur 83</p> <p>Downing West Ham United 80</p> <p>Cazorla Arsenal 74</p> <p>Larsson Sunderland 70</p> <p>Sigurdsson Swansea City 60</p> <p>S\xc3\xa1nchez Arsenal 58</p> <p>Nasri Manchester City 54</p> <p>Baines Everton 53</p> <p>Brunt West Bromwich Albion 53</p> Corners that have led to goal attempts* <p>Barton Queens Park Rangers 15</p> <p>Cazorla Arsenal 14</p> <p>Downing West Ham United 14</p> <p>Gerrard Liverpool 13</p> <p>Larsson Sunderland 13</p> <p>F\xc3\xa0bregas Chelsea 10</p> <p>James Leicester City 10</p> <p>Sigurdsson Swansea City 10</p> <p>Eriksen Tottenham Hotspur</p> <p>Moses Stoke City 9</p> <p>* No Manchester United player in the top 20</p>'
