b'Liverpool v Swansea <p>Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s midfielder Ki Sung-yueng wants to move a step closer to a Capital One Cup final hat-trick by beating Liverpool. The South Korean has played in the past two League Cup finals, on a winning side for Swansea in 2013 and for a losing Sunderland team while on loan at the Stadium of Light last season, and would love to make it three in a row this term. Liverpool stand in his way in the last 16 at Anfield but Ki was part of the Swansea side who won 3-1 on Merseyside two seasons ago en route to claiming the first major trophy in the club\xe2\x80\x99s history. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was fabulous there two years ago, it was the same time of the competition in October so we are definitely looking forward to playing one of the big teams in England,\xe2\x80\x9d Ki said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d love to go to Wembley three years in a row if I can.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Shrewsbury Town v Chelsea <p>The Chelsea captain, John Terry, claims he and Branislav Ivanovic were \xe2\x80\x9cdouble headlocked at every corner\xe2\x80\x9d during the 1-1 draw at Manchester United. Chelsea felt they should have been awarded a penalty in the first half when Ivanovic went down during a tussle with Chris Smalling at a set piece. Just in front of Ivanovic, Terry also tumbled to the ground as he battled with Marcos Rojo. Terry wrote on Instagram: \xe2\x80\x9cIt shows how well we are playing when you come away from Old Trafford disappointed with 1 point. Thanks to all the travelling fans for your great support. #JTandIVAgotdoubleheadlockedfromeverycorner.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Bournemouth v West Bromwich Albion <p>Eddie Howe is aiming to steer Bournemouth into the League Cup quarter-finals for the first time in their history after a memorable 8-0 win at Birmingham on Saturday. \xe2\x80\x9cThe club has been hugely successful over the past two years and to potentially break a record which has stood since the competition started would be a remarkable achievement,\xe2\x80\x9d the manager told the Daily Echo. West Brom\xe2\x80\x99s Craig Dawson has avoided punishment for a challenge on Crystal Palace\xe2\x80\x99s Juli\xc3\xa1n Speroni after the Football Association reviewed the incident. The strikers Victor Anichebe and Brown Ideye could start for the visitors, who are expected to make several changes.</p> Fulham v Derby County <p>Derby County\xe2\x80\x99s captain, Richard Keogh, says his side\xe2\x80\x99s 5-1 home win over Fulham in August will have no bearing on this match. Fulham were then under Felix Magath but have been much improved since Kit Symons took over as caretaker. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be a different game down there from when we played them up here earlier in the season,\xe2\x80\x9d Keogh told Derby\xe2\x80\x99s website. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have changed manager so it might be a different team.\xe2\x80\x9d Fulham\xe2\x80\x99s Lasse Vigen Christensen said the squad would have the defeat of two months ago in their minds. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a little bit of making up to do for ourselves and also for the fans,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Fulham\xe2\x80\x99s website.</p> MK Dons v Sheffield United <p>Sheffield United take on their League One promotion rivals after three successive away victories in all competitions. The manager Nigel Clough, whose side have won at West Ham and Leyton Orient in this competition already, said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are now trying to develop and play away from home as well as we do at Bramall Lane. If we start converting our chances teams will really struggle to handle us.\xe2\x80\x9d The MK Dons defender Tom Flanagan is keenly anticipating this tie. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we win this game and get another decent draw in the next round then we\xe2\x80\x99re staring at Wembley, which is the stuff people dream of,\xe2\x80\x9d the 23-year-old told MK Dons Player.</p>'
