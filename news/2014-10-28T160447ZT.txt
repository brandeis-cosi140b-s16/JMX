b'\xe2\x80\x98JAG-OFF BOWLING TROPHIES\xe2\x80\x99 <p>Whether it was Leo Messi\xe2\x80\x99s passable impersonation of Ron Burgundy in his shiny velvet three-piece, Him turning on the waterworks and giving it the full Gwyneth upon receiving his prize, or the astonishing number of bald patches on show in the predominantly motionless and male audience as they sat listening to the happy-clappy nonsense emanating from the trap of wispily bearded official Fifa-sanctioned Swiss $ex god Marc Sway, the Fiver still has nightmares about the excruciating three-hour marathon of self-congratulatory backslapping that was last January\xe2\x80\x99s Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or ceremony.</p> <p>Preparations for next January\xe2\x80\x99s beano began this morning with the official announcement of the 23-strong list of contenders and in England, as usual, rather than focus on those who were nominated, the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of the headlines were devoted to those who were not. Specifically, everyone who disgraced themselves in an England shirt during the World Cup and a former Liverpool player who scored lots and lots of goals in between sinking his teeth into various opponents. Just as the Fiver never wins any baubles for its regular biting satire, it seems that everyone\xe2\x80\x99s favourite Uruguayan has been overlooked for his regular biting.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe selection criteria for the players of the year are: sporting performance as well as general behaviour on and off the pitch from 30 November 2013 until 21 November 2014,\xe2\x80\x9d drones Fifa\xe2\x80\x99s Big Book O\xe2\x80\x99Selecting Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or Candidates, which goes some way towards explaining why Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez has fallen short in the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral behaviour\xe2\x80\x9d stakes, while England\xe2\x80\x99s finest have missed out due to shortcomings in the \xe2\x80\x9csporting performance\xe2\x80\x9d department.</p> <p>With the Fifa list due to be whittled down to just three names in December, before He is announced the winner in a very long and boring ceremony in Zurich\xe2\x80\x99s Kongresshaus a month later, Britain can at least console itself with the fact that Wales have at least got one representative on the list of nominees. Gareth Bale got the nod for his sterling scampering, sprinting and scoring since moving from Tottenham to Real Madrid. And while he won\xe2\x80\x99t win, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, because for all the handwringing twaddle and nonsense you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear and read about who really deserves it in the coming months, the Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or is an award and all awards are completely stupid.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is beyond me that we feel the need to set aside a night to give out these jag-off bowling trophies six times a year so that all these people can pat each other on the back about how much money they\xe2\x80\x99re making for boring the p1ss out of half the world,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jerry Seinfeld once, while accepting an award. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t talking about Fifa\xe2\x80\x99s annual gong-giving, but he might as well have been. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a very long night.</p> <p>That list of nominees in full: Gareth Bale (Wales), Karim Benzema (France), Diego Costa (Spain), Thibaut Courtois (Belgium), Him (Portugal), Angel di Mar\xc3\xada (Argentina), Mario G\xc3\xb6tze (Germany), Eden Hazard (Belgium), Zlatan Ibrahimovic (Sweden), Andr\xc3\xa9s Iniesta (Spain), Toni Kroos (Germany), Philipp Lahm (Germany), Javier Mascherano (Argentina), Theme Pub O\xe2\x80\x99Fiver (Republic O\xe2\x80\x99Ireland), Lionel Messi (Argentina), Thomas M\xc3\xbcller (Germany), Manuel Neuer (Germany), Neymar (Brazil), Paul Pogba (France), Sergio Ramos (Spain), Arjen Robben (Holland), James Rodr\xc3\xadguez (Colombia), Bastian Schweinsteiger (Germany), Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 (Ivory Coast).</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Paul Doyle will be clockwatching the Milk Cup fourth-round ties to within an inch of their very being. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let him down. 7.45pm GMT. Or else.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a group of us sitting there, and Glen Johnson came over and said: \xe2\x80\x98I know who\xe2\x80\x99s in the envelopes. I know what\xe2\x80\x99s written on all three pieces of paper.\xe2\x80\x99 Who?

We have experienced such things in the past at the Sochi Olympics. However, during and after the [Winter] Games there was not one bad word written about the event\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Fifa\xe2\x80\x99s overlord reckons we should all get off Russia\xe2\x80\x99s back before the 2018 World Cup because the Olympics in Sochi were controversy-free.</p> <p>Perhaps Sepp just missed this.
