b'Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend action'


b'1) United shine brightest without their \xc3\x81ngel <p>After Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s finest display under Louis van Gaal was achieved without \xc3\x81ngel Di Mar\xc3\xada might the Argentinian face a fight to recover his place in the starting XI? To have a \xc2\xa359.7m player unable to get in the side is the scenario facing British football\xe2\x80\x99s most expensive signing. The 3-0 thrashing of Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford was a return to the United of verve, skill and cutting edge that go at the opposition like a juggernaut and happened as Di Mar\xc3\xada was unavailable due to suspension. Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s side simply looked more balanced and, as the manager said afterwards, were a tight unit who gave Spurs no chance to breathe.</p> <p>Next are Liverpool at Anfield where a United victory might all but kill the hopes of the Merseyside club of qualifying for the Champions League. It would also provide a major fillip to Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s aim of doing just that. The Dutchman always says he thinks nothing of the \xe2\x80\x9cname\xe2\x80\x9d (or indeed price) of a player, merely their form. Di Mar\xc3\xada\xe2\x80\x99s form has been patchy, so will Van Gaal change a winning and finally impressive United team to accommodate him? We are about to find out \xe2\x80\xa6 Jamie Jackson</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Manchester United 3-0 Tottenham\xe2\x80\xa2 Rooney and Van Gaal play down boxing story after United win \xe2\x80\xa2 David Hytner: Rooney shows fighting spirit in win\xe2\x80\xa2 Van Gaal gets passing combination right against Spurs\xe2\x80\xa2 Rooney \xe2\x80\x98knocked out in kitchen boxing bout\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\xa2 De Gea is saving grace of United\xe2\x80\x99s confusing season</p>  2) Mourinho decides to let football do the talking <p>At one point, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho was asked the very leading question of whether he felt Chelsea would ever get another penalty this season. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a question,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a question, it\xe2\x80\x99s a question.\xe2\x80\x9d But he left it there. No diatribes about the referee, no references to his complaint about a perceived \xe2\x80\x9ccampaign\xe2\x80\x9d and no attempts to manipulate the headlines. \xe2\x80\x9cMy opinion is not important,\xe2\x80\x9d was his take. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only important one is Mr Mike Dean.\xe2\x80\x9d It was the theme of a day when Chelsea seemed absolutely determined that their first game since the Champions League tie against Paris Saint-Germain would be one occasion when they did not drive the controversy. And in this season of grievance after grievance from their manager \xe2\x80\x93 many legitimate, just as many not even close \xe2\x80\x93 it felt like a welcome change to find Mourinho wanting to talk about the football rather than another injustice session.</p> <p>Will it last? Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope so but this is Mourinho and the lesson of history is that it will not be long before the old temptations are too strong (and, yes, sometimes it would help if the media did not have so many questions about the referee). \xe2\x80\x9cYou will have to control me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho, giving the impression he was itching to reveal his true feelings, said to the press officer in the next seat. But it was a change of direction from the Chelsea manager and that, at least, is a start. Daniel Taylor</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Chelsea 1-1 Southampton\xe2\x80\xa2 Mourinho says Arsenal are title rivals to Chelsea\xe2\x80\xa2 Chelsea have lost their rhythm, and none more so than F\xc3\xa0bregas\xe2\x80\xa2 Daniel Taylor: Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s poor respect-to-referees record is not unique </p>  3) Giroud\xe2\x80\x99s next great test of character is coming right up <p>As even the vaguest observer of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger knows, \xe2\x80\x9cmental strength\xe2\x80\x9d is one of his most reliable sayings. It happens to be one of his favourite qualities in Olivier Giroud, who needed it more than ever in recent weeks. It is fair to wonder whether part of his dramatic fall during a hellish hour against Monaco in the Champions League was brought upon himself. Before the game he gave an expansive interview to L\xe2\x80\x99Equipe, in which he outlined his confidence in himself compared to the current standard bearers in terms of Premier League strikers. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have an inferiority complex,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOn a stats level, I am just behind Costa and Ag\xc3\xbcero.\xe2\x80\x9d Those words clanged as he was substituted having slammed his hands on the turf, aghast at the misses he endured that night in the 3-1 first-leg defeat.</p> <p>Overall, since recovering ahead of schedule from a broken leg suffered in the second game of the season, Giroud has largely had an excellent season. The Monaco blip was a rare shocker. The tone of the debate about his capacity to damage the bigger teams has also changed as this season he has goals against both Manchester clubs and Liverpool. The attention will certainly focus on him at the Stade Louis II, where he is eager to make up for missing a string of chances in the first leg. Wenger is certain Giroud has the mental strength not only to deal with the situation, but to thrive. With Danny Welbeck also in lively form \xe2\x80\x93 he tore at a tired West Ham in an exciting cameo \xe2\x80\x93 the potential for goals is there. Amy Lawrence</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Arsenal 3-0 West Ham\xe2\x80\xa2 Walcott\xe2\x80\x99s new Arsenal deal may be tricky yet again\xe2\x80\xa2 Sean Ingle: Give us a break over winter demands on English clubs </p>            Arsenal not worried about winning Premier League, says Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger.    4) Burnley must keep their momentum going <p>Burnley have a difficult run of fixtures coming up, with Southampton, Tottenham and Arsenal their next three opponents, so George Boyd\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that they tend to raise their game against the big teams is going to be put to the test. If Burnley can take something from those three games to keep confidence high and stay in touch with the sides just above them, they have half a dozen more winnable matches to complete their season, including fixtures against Everton and relegation rivals Leicester, Hull and Aston Villa. The team they would really fancy playing at the moment is Sunderland, precariously placed just one point above the drop zone and in all sorts of trouble, though that chance has gone. Burnley could manage only a goalless draw when Gus Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s side came to Turf Moor in September, and were beaten by a couple of goals on Wearside earlier this year. So Sunderland have taken four points from Burnley, just as Burnley have taken four points from Manchester City. The latter sounds a real achievement, yet it will count for nothing unless Burnley keep their momentum going over the next few weeks. Paul Wilson</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Burnley 1-0 Manchester City \xe2\x80\xa2 Pellegrini won\xe2\x80\x99t concede title after Burnley loss </p>  5) Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s flexibility allows Lennon and Lukaku to flourish <p>Credit where credit is due. Having criticised Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez for his intransigence over Everton\xe2\x80\x99s tactics and team selection prior to Newcastle United\xe2\x80\x99s crucial visit to Goodison Park, it is only fair to highlight his flexibility in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s crucial 3-0 win. Mart\xc3\xadnez made five changes to his lineup and reverted to a 4-3-3 formation that allowed Aaron Lennon and Romelu Lukaku to flourish against John Carver\xe2\x80\x99s defence. There were no signs of anxiety afflicting Everton\xe2\x80\x99s players as the wise old heads of Leon Osman and Phil Jagielka underpinned a composed display that eased the pressure on their manager. \xe2\x80\x9cI am proud that we played with a lot of intensity and freshness after playing in Europe, something we haven\xe2\x80\x99t done in the past,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mart\xc3\xadnez. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe we have learned mentally. The way we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to cope with the demands of this week showed we have come a long, long way.\xe2\x80\x9d Andy Hunter</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Everton 3-0 Newcastle \xe2\x80\xa2 Lukaku has faith in Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s Everton philosophy</p>      Romelu Lukaku, right, and Aaron Lennon thrived in Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s changed 4-3-3 formation.

It is surely no coincidence that he was absent, suspended, as Gus Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s side surrendered 4-0 at home to Aston Villa on Saturday and also missed the recent, similarly shocking, home defeat to QPR and the FA Cup exit at Bradford through injury. When Cattermole plays well in central midfield he helps disguise Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s manifold flaws but as Liam Bridcutt\xe2\x80\x99s shocking display against Villa emphasised there is no remotely adequate deputy at the Stadium of Light. Whoever manages the team for the rest of the season, the club\xe2\x80\x99s owner, Ellis Short, must pray Cattermole stays fit. If not Sunderland are surely destined for the Championship. Louise Taylor</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Sunderland 0-4 Aston Villa\xe2\x80\xa2 Fan mutiny pushes Poyet to the brink \xe2\x80\xa2 Sportblog: Villa pitch invasion doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mark return to \xe2\x80\x98dark ages\xe2\x80\x99 </p>  7) Passion gets the better of Pearson too often for Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s good <p>Nigel Pearson has not done himself too many favours this season. You could argue that a manager who evidently cares so much is welcome respite from the humdrum, cliche-ridden post-match press duties which seem like the ultimate chore for managers and even more so players. Football is meant to be passionate, so what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with conveying that in press conferences? The problem is, managers can be overly passionate and that can have a detrimental effect. Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s bizarre interaction with a journalist after Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s 0-0 draw with Hull \xe2\x80\x93 ending with him referring to the journalist as \xe2\x80\x9ca prick\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 has not only painted him in a bad light once again but also presented an illustration of a man who has lost sight of what really matters. Sometimes you can care too much and the end result is the opposite to what is desired. Alan Smith</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Leicester 0-0 Hull \xe2\x80\xa2 Pearson swears at journalist after Hull draw\xe2\x80\xa2 FA reports upsurge in on-pitch disorder across professional game</p>            Nigel Pearson appears to call a journalist a \xe2\x80\x98prick\xe2\x80\x99.    8) Ramsey in a no-win situation at QPR <p>When asked after Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s lousy defeat at Crystal Palace whether anything is going his way at the moment, Queens Park Rangers\xe2\x80\x99 head coach, Chris Ramsey, replied: \xe2\x80\x9cMy son is doing quite well in school\xe2\x80\x9d. It was a light-hearted quip from a man who might be reflecting on the wisdom of that old maxim about being careful what you wish for. Because the job that he asked to be given after Harry Redknapp stepped down, ostensibly to undergo knee surgery, always had the look of a hospital pass. Initially Ramsey stimulated an improvement in performances \xe2\x80\x93 and even guided the club to their first away win of the season \xe2\x80\x93 but the listless display in Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s defeat at Crystal Palace suggested that there are deeper underlying problems at the club than any new manager (even Tony Fernandes\xe2\x80\x99 elusive dream one) could be expected to resolve in the little time available to Ramsey. If the 52-year-old manages to lift the club to safety despite inheriting a jumbled squad that has been further weakened by injuries, then he will deserve acclaim. And if QPR go down, he will likely deserve little of the blame. Paul Doyle</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Crystal Palace 3-1 QPR\xe2\x80\xa2 \xc2\xa390m Crystal Palace takeover by US consortium nearing completion \xe2\x80\x93 reports</p>  9) Pulis the miracle worker <p>There aren\xe2\x80\x99t too many sure things in football, but Tony Pulis is basically as close as it comes. When he arrived at The Hawthorns, West Brom were a point off the relegation zone having won one in their previous nine, and it looked like the only thing that might save them was the incompetence of others. Ten weeks later and the Baggies are eight points clear and closer to the top half than the bottom three, six wins from seven at home after Pulis cast his own brand of industrial light and magic onto the side.</p> <p>And while their defence has tightened up (six clean sheets in his 10 games, as opposed to the six in the 19 BP \xe2\x80\x93 Before Pulis), perhaps the biggest single beneficiary has been Brown Ideye. The Nigerian striker had just one league strike to his name before Pulis arrived (a consolation against Manchester City on Boxing Day), and is probably only at the club after the bizarre chain of deadline-day transfers collapsed and Carlton Cole was stopped from moving to the Midlands. However, since the start of February Ideye has five in all competitions, including the bullet header that secured the latest three points, and suddenly a club record mistake has turned into one of West Brom\xe2\x80\x99s crucial matchwinners, perhaps just as importantly taking some of the burden off Saido Berahino. All hail Pulis, bona fide magician.

After all, revenue, and a hefty potential fall therein, is pretty much the only thing that the Premier League really seems to care about. Unfortunately, given the newest rights deal has only just been agreed, that\xe2\x80\x99s very much a long-term solution. In the meantime, why not simply adopt the rugby union convention, under which the captain is the only player allowed to approach and speak to the referee - under any circumstances.
