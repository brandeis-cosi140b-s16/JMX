b'Everton v Chelsea: match preview'


b'<p>Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez claimed his first league win as Everton manager against Chelsea, the victory arriving in the second home game of last season following three draws. After two draws so far, both a consequence of conceding late goals, he will be hoping for a repeat with the ex-Chelsea strikers Romelu Lukaku and Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o in his ranks but this is a far more potent and creative Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho side than the one that arrived at Goodison Park for Eto\xe2\x80\x99o\xe2\x80\x99s debut 12 months ago.
