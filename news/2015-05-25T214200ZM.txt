b'Manuel Pellegrini confident of his future as Manchester City manager'


b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini landed in Canada on Monday evening for Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s post-season tour convinced he will remain in place as the manager for next season.</p> <p>Khaldoon al-Mubarak, the City chairman, spent time with Pellegrini on Sunday when City played their final home match of the season, the 2-0 victory over Southampton. Yet whether he then carried out the expected review of Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s performance is unclear. Senior sources have signalled there is no expectation the manager will be removed.</p> <p>This is largely down to the club\xe2\x80\x99s impressive finish to the season that began after City lost the derby at Manchester United 4-2 on 12 April. From then, they won their last six matches in a strong run of form that secured second place in the Premier League on 79 points, eight points behind the champions, Chelsea.</p>  <p> Related: Manchester City 2-0 Southampton | Premier League match report </p>   <p>Although this meant the club ended the season without a trophy after winning the title and the Capital One Cup in Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s debut campaign, there is a recognition that the championship is difficult to claim every year.</p> <p>In analysing the season Pellegrini is unsure if the decline in goalscoring is a fundamental reason why his team came up short as City were again the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s top scorers with 83 strikes, 10 more than Chelsea. In last year\xe2\x80\x99s title-winning campaign 102 were registered.</p> <p>Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not so easy to make that analysis because we were the highest scoring team this year and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t win the title. Maybe we had the highest scorer in the Premier League [Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero] and the goalkeeper [Joe Hart] with the most clean sheets and the best goal difference but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t win the title. It\xe2\x80\x99s also important to concede less goals because there are a lot of points that you lose through just one goal.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He believes City must develop more ruthlessness against teams near the bottom. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe we will continue being a high-scoring team but we must be a more consistent team that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lose points against teams in the relegation positions,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>Pellegrini is aiming to refresh and strengthen the squad in the close season, though one player who may now remain is Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9.</p> <p>The Ivorian does not enjoy the best relations with the club and his agent, Dimitri Seluk, recently insisted Tour\xc3\xa9 was \xe2\x80\x9c90% certain\xe2\x80\x9d to leave City in the summer. Now, though, Seluk, whose pronouncements can be erratic, claims the midfielder has been told he is wanted for next season as he is \xe2\x80\x9ctoo important to let go\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>A year ago Seluk also claimed Tour\xc3\xa9 would leave. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a big possibility Yaya will leave this summer,\xe2\x80\x9d he said last May, after Tour\xc3\xa9 was unhappy that the club had not marked his birthday with enough significance. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is very upset. What happened at his birthday means the club don\xe2\x80\x99t care about him. It was proof,\xe2\x80\x9d Seluk said.</p> <p>Given these mixed messages Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s immediate future remains unclear. He is with the rest of the squad in Canada, where they play Toronto on Wednesday and then fly to Texas to meet Houston Dynamo the following day. They are also attending New York City FC\xe2\x80\x99s MLS game with Houston on Saturday.</p>'
