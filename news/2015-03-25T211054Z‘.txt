b'\xe2\x80\x98Harry Kane is an inspiration to all the young England players coming through\xe2\x80\x99'


b'<p>Harry Kane knows how to make an entrance. It was June 2013 and England\xe2\x80\x99s Under\xe2\x80\x9120s were in Turkey, preparing for their World Cup, and the manager, Peter Taylor, decided that a spot of team-bonding was in order.</p> <p>They would have a golf putting competition, Taylor said, and so names were drawn and everybody divided into threesomes \xe2\x80\x93 not only players but staff members too. With everything organised, the instruction was given to reconvene later on.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe difference was that when everybody came back down, Harry was dressed in full golf gear,\xe2\x80\x9d Taylor says, smiling at the memory. \xe2\x80\x9cHe could have walked on to the Belfry. I just thought: \xe2\x80\x98What a lovely bit of humour that is.\xe2\x80\x99 He probably got hammered for it by the other lads but I loved it. It was absolutely brilliant.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Kane is a good golfer who plays off a handicap of eight. He is one of those people who can turn his hand to almost any sport. He won the putting competition with his partners \xe2\x80\x93 of course he did \xe2\x80\x93 even if, to quote Taylor, it was the sort of thing where \xe2\x80\x9cit wasn\xe2\x80\x99t always guaranteed that the best golfer would win\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHarry loves his golf,\xe2\x80\x9d Taylor adds. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s silly good at it. But what I would say is that whenever Harry does anything, he takes it seriously, otherwise he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t bother doing it at all. That was the impression I got from\xc2\xa0him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It is the impression that each of his England youth managers have had and there is the palpable sense of pride and excitement within the set-up as Kane prepares to make his senior bow in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley on Friday night.</p> <p>Kane was given his England debut at under-17 level \xe2\x80\x93 the manager, John Peacock, selected him for the Algarve tournament in February 2010 against France, Ukraine and Portugal \xe2\x80\x93 and he went on to represent the under\xe2\x80\x9119s, the under-20s, who were formed exclusively for the World Cup, and the under-21s.</p> <p>His time with the under-21s may not yet be over. Kane is eager to play for Gareth Southgate\xe2\x80\x99s team at the European Championship in the Czech Republic this summer, having made eight appearances and scored six goals during the successful qualifying\xc2\xa0campaign.</p> <p>If Kane has emerged as the latest, great hope of the English game, after his sensational breakthrough season at Tottenham Hotspur, in which he has 29 goals already, he is a poster boy, in many respects, for the Football Association\xe2\x80\x99s youth development system. Coaches in this country have grown sick and tired of hearing there is a dearth of young, English talent. Kane proves it is not the\xc2\xa0case.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m buzzing to see Harry in the senior squad,\xe2\x80\x9d says Noel Blake, a former England Under-19 manager who worked with Kane. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is nothing greater for us, as national coaches, than to see them go on to the seniors. The big thing for me is that there are so many good, young English players who are showing that by the way, we can play.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Kane\xe2\x80\x99s international story takes in full-throttle determination, experimentation over his position and tournament disappointment \xe2\x80\x93 which ought to set him fair for a career at senior level.</p> <p>He helped Peacock\xe2\x80\x99s under-17s to qualify for the 2010 European Championship in Liechtenstein only to miss out on the finals because of illness (England would win the tournament) and he was a part of Blake\xe2\x80\x99s under-19 team that fell at the semi-final stage of the 2012 European Championship in Estonia. That finish earned England a ticket to the under-20 World Cup in Turkey but they went out at the group\xc2\xa0phase.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHarry missed a header in the final group tie against Egypt and I joke that I\xe2\x80\x99ll never forgive him for it,\xe2\x80\x9d Taylor says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d drawn our first two games, against Iraq and Chile, and we just needed one win. We slaughtered Egypt but we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t score and they nicked it at the end.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d never dream now that Harry would not score this kind of opportunity. I saw [the FA\xe2\x80\x99s former director of football development] Trevor Brooking the day after Harry had scored the header against Arsenal to win the derby at White Hart Lane \xe2\x80\x93 what a goal that was \xe2\x80\x93 and we both had a chuckle, saying: \xe2\x80\x98If Harry had have scored a 10-times-easier header than that against Egypt we\xe2\x80\x99d have been at the tournament longer. I\xe2\x80\x99m a little bit surprised that he has scored the goals he has this season but it\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic for the boy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Taylor played Kane as a No9 but he had also been used as a second striker and even as an attacking midfielder. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was more of a No10,\xe2\x80\x9d Blake says. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he played in midfield too, like a No8. We had some good forwards \xe2\x80\x93 Nathan Redmond, Saido Berahino, Ross Barkley, Benik Afobe and it was hard to fit them all in. We played with three strikers and Harry was like a roaming striker-cum-midfield player.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFrom our point of view, it\xe2\x80\x99s about development. I remember playing against Spain and they played with a No4, a Busquets type. It was Oriol Romeu, who went on to sign for Chelsea. I just said to Harry: \xe2\x80\x98Your responsibility when we haven\xe2\x80\x99t got the ball is him.\xe2\x80\x99 I can still visualise him, scanning his eyes around for him. He was terrific. Yes, Harry is scoring goals now, but he can be just as good as a\xc2\xa0No10.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Kenny Swain, the former under\xe2\x80\x9116s coach who also served as Peacock\xe2\x80\x99s assistant at under-17 level, describes Kane as \xe2\x80\x9cthe classic story of development\xe2\x80\x9d. He recalls how Kane was \xe2\x80\x9con the radar\xe2\x80\x9d but not bleeping too loudly as a 16- or 17-year-old, mainly because of the other attacking talents in his year group such as Connor Wickham, Berahino and Afobe.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHarry wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as effective at that stage as some of the other boys who went on to win the Euros in Liechtenstein,\xe2\x80\x9d Swain says. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I do recall discussing him on many occasions with John McDermott [the Tottenham academy manager] and John always had a strong feeling for Harry.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Harry first joined up with the under-17s for the Algarve tournament, I saw all the things that John had spoken about. The most outstanding thing for me was his character \xe2\x80\x93 his drive and determination. It was not so much his technical ability but he had a thirst and an appetite for work, for goals and wanting to learn and do\xc2\xa0better.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Peacock was similarly impressed. \xe2\x80\x9cHarry\xe2\x80\x99s attitude was excellent,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was very enthusiastic and always itching to get on the pitch. It\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult to tell when they are 16-17 years of age how they are going to develop but the potential was always there with Harry. I like to give the boys ownership and he always responded well to that. He is a sensible lad and fully dedicated to his football.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Blake could scarcely believe what he was seeing when he first worked with Kane. \xe2\x80\x9cWe trained at West Brom, ahead of our first qualifying game in 2010-11, and he blew me away,\xe2\x80\x9d Blake says. \xe2\x80\x9cI said to the group: \xe2\x80\x98What he has said to us with that performance in his first training session is that he is not here just to be in the squad.\xe2\x80\x99 His performance warranted that he actually started in the team. And he did. People talk about his work ethic in matches but he trains that\xc2\xa0way.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Kane gives good first impressions and it is invariably the strength of his personality and the depth of his dedication that shine through. Conor Coady was the captain of Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s under-20 team, and the Huddersfield Town midfielder also played with Kane at under-17 and under-19 levels. He marvels at Kane\xe2\x80\x99s sheer relentlessness.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHarry was always asking the manager of each of those teams about how he could improve, what more he could do,\xe2\x80\x9d Coady says.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe at those levels he never really stood out as much as he is now but he was always asking questions, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what has made him the player he is now.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe amount of dedication he puts towards football is ridiculous. He was always the last player off the training pitch and the first on to it. He\xe2\x80\x99s an inspiration to all young lads coming\xc2\xa0through.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>What Kane has done is reinforce the sense there is a pathway from the junior England teams. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you impress at under-21 level I\xe2\x80\x99m sure it will get back to the manager of the senior team,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tom Carroll, the Tottenham and England Under-21 midfielder who is on loan at Swansea City for the season. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s shown with the likes of Harry and [Everton\xe2\x80\x99s] John Stones.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHarry played a big part in our qualification and he\xe2\x80\x99s just a really good pro and a top lad. We normally share a room on international duty and we tend to chill but when it comes to Fifa or table tennis it can get quite competitive. With the table tennis Harry is quite a defensive player while I am playing all the attacking shots.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Kane will smile at that comment but he has acquired the habit of having the last word. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember Harry coming down for that putting competition in his full golf attire,\xe2\x80\x9d Coady says. \xe2\x80\x9cHe definitely got a bit of stick but saying that, he took the mick out of us all when he won it. We weren\xe2\x80\x99t really saying much after that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
