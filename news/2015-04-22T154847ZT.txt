b'The Fiver | Donations from the public to poor Real Madrid'


b'<p>ANOTHER WEEK, ANOTHER MADRID DERBY</p> <p>Bang! Clank! Ouch! Oh, hi there, reader, you join us just as The Fiver is in its workshop/office/bedroom/toilet/pavement trying to knock up a placard calling for donations from the public to poor Real Madrid, who find themselves in a state of near destitution as they prepare to contest tonight\xe2\x80\x99s second leg of their Big Cup quarter-final against city rivals Atl\xc3\xa9tico, with the tie fiendlishly poised at 0-0. Real have already faced their bullying neighbours seven times this season and failed to win even once, and tonight they must cope without Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Luka Modric, who are all knacked, Marcelo, who is suspended, and Alan Pardew, whom they have not yet got around to appointing.</p> <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s all very well divvying up practically all of La Liga\xe2\x80\x99s TV revenue with their business partners in Catalonia, but having to go through the formality of actually beating other teams on the pitch, too, is proving very wearisome for Real. So come on, reader, give generously!</p> <p>Bang! Clank! Ouch! No, reader, we\xe2\x80\x99re not still making that placard, because we\xe2\x80\x99ve just realised that we\xe2\x80\x99ve run out of wood and don\xe2\x80\x99t know where to find any more. That\xe2\x80\x99s right, reader, The Fiver can\xe2\x80\x99t get wood, no need to labour the point. Bang! Clank! Ouch! That then, reader, is the likely soundtrack to tonight\xe2\x80\x99s clash at the Bernab\xc3\xa9u, as Atl\xc3\xa9tico get stuck into their neighbours and Real grow frustrated at their inability to penetrate and the tussle degenerates into pushing and shoving and rolling and biting and kicking and mewling and puking [basically the good stuff \xe2\x80\x93 Fiver Ed]. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to savour and enjoy more nights like these because they don\xe2\x80\x99t come around often,\xe2\x80\x9d blared Diego Simeone before that eighth meeting with Real this season.</p> <p>The Rojiblancos have problems too, much more serious ones than the fact that most English speakers have no idea who the Rojiblancos are, which is why hipsters should cease using the term forthwith. Firstly, Mario Su\xc3\xa1rez is suspended. Secondly, Mario Mandzukic may not be fit enough to resume his entertaining strop with Dani Carvajal and Sergio Ramos. But Simeone is putting on a brave face. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have players who can keep us safe at the back,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, before adding almost as an afterthrought: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd attack, if possible.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Barry Glendenning for MBM coverage of Real Madrid 1-1 Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid (1-1 agg, Atl\xc3\xa9tico win on away goals) from 7.45pm BST, while Paul Doyle will be on hand for Monaco 0-1 Juventus (0-2 agg).</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen he was younger, he liked to party. Now he is quieter\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Jesper Hansen discusses \xc3\x89vian team-mate and Denmark striker Nicki Bille Nielsen, who faces a potential eight-year stretch in the big house, accused of biting a police officer.</p> RECOMMENDED VIEWING <p>When asked to put together a fancy video previewing tonight\xe2\x80\x99s Madrid derby, The Fiver thought it would call on stereotypical Spanish cousin, Juan de la Juan de la Juan de la Juan Straw Donkey Acoustic Guitar Ol\xc3\xa9 Ol\xc3\xa9 Ol\xc3\xa9 Eldorado Sun Sea Sand Dust Fiver for help. Sadly he was still asleep at the time of going to press send, so here\xe2\x80\x99s Sid Lowe and assorted Spanish hacks instead.</p>      WIN! WIN! WIN! <p>A triple-threat of (home) Premier League tickets up for grabs: West Brom v Liverpool, Southampton v Tottenham and Burnley v Leicester. Enter now!</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs always the FA semis brought to mind the day we went to Wembley. The game was over and, as we drove across London, we stopped for petrol. I had bagsied shotgun and, being in the passenger seat, was dispatched to get drinks and snacks for the journey home. I got out of the car, my mate\xe2\x80\x99s black Golf, and went into the garage, bought a bag full of goodies and returned to the car, busily trying to open a pork pie with my teeth. I opened the door, climbed in and turned around to say something when I noticed the car was completely empty apart from a small Pakistani gentleman in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat, who I\xe2\x80\x99d never seen before in my life. We both screamed in unison. He: \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t hurt me!\xe2\x80\x99 And me: \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s happening?!?\xe2\x80\x99 As I scrambled backwards out of the car, pork pie lost forever in his passenger foot-well, it became apparent that the Golf I had climbed into was parked directly in front of the one I should have climbed into, complete with three braying idiots, roaring with laughter and shouting \xe2\x80\x98Aaaah!!\xe2\x80\x99 I laugh about it now, but I still think about that pie from time to time\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Marten Allen.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge of teutonic culinary etiquette is abysmal.

I suspect your eggheads may have to come up with some new formula when it comes to dealing with Bayern\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Neil Speight.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFor the new crop of Fiver nicknames (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters), how about you just apply the $ from $tevie Mbe to Raheem $terling? Even though Raheem \xc2\xa3terling would be more appropriate, the inaccuracy and laziness of $terling seems more in keeping with The Fiver\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Brian Saxby.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHere is my tuppence worth: UFC\xe2\x80\x99s Diego Costa / Nigel Pearson? Jack Grealish could be called Morrissey \xe2\x80\x93 Irish blood, English heart, etc. I will continue to think and probably send more\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Karl Gibbons.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
