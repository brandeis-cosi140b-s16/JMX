b'Liverpool v Crystal Palace: Premier League - as it happened'


b'<p>Anfield rises as one to salute Gerrard as he jogs off. Not for the first time in the last 12 months or so, there\xe2\x80\x99ll be quite some inner turmoil going on. But he keeps a brave face on it. And let\xe2\x80\x99s face it, things could be worse. He\xe2\x80\x99s off to live in LA for a start, and those In-N-Out Burgers taste damn fine. Also, his time at Anfield hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been too shoddy. Once more with feeling: three League Cups. Two FA Cups. Two Super Cups. One Charity Shield. One Uefa Cup. Three seasons as Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s top goalscorer. 41 individual awards, including an OBE. 709 appearances and 185 goals. And the most famous Champions League final of all. OK, we\xe2\x80\x99ve also got to factor in one famous slip, a splattering of rash tackles, a few hundred Hollywood passes whistled straight into the stands - and now a farewell party spoiled. But hey, nobody\xe2\x80\x99s perfect.</p>'
