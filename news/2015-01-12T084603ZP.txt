b'1) Van Gaal struggles to find fluidity <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe struggle for fluidity\xe2\x80\x9d may sound like a PhD thesis but is actually the quality that continues to elude Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s Manchester United, as was again illustrated in the disjointed fashion they went down 1-0 to Southampton on Sunday. For this 21st outing of each team\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League season, United\xe2\x80\x99s manager went for a 3-1-4-2 formation that featured the sight of \xc3\x81ngel Di Mar\xc3\xada partnering Robin van Persie in attack.</p> <p>The Argentinian is no frontline striker and, though this may have contributed to United\xe2\x80\x99s stilted play, the problem can be located further back in the team. Juan Mata fluttered in and out of the contest, as he can. Wayne Rooney was a virtual non-factor alongside the Spaniard in his new midfield role. And Luke Shaw and Antonio Valencia, as the supposed wing-backs, did little to create space by offering the clever movement that could help make the home team a shape-shifting proposition difficult for Saints to fathom.</p> <p>This left Michael Carrick, normally a supreme schemer-in-chief in front of the defence, with scant options to prise Ronald Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s side open with those slide-rule passes that can turn a game.</p> <p>Despite his myriad attacking options, then, Van Gaal is yet to make United what he so dearly wants: a side of consistently slick and dazzling cohesion. Jamie Jackson</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Manchester United 0-1 Southampton\xe2\x80\xa2 Michael Cox: Southampton use disruption to beat United\xe2\x80\xa2 Ronald Koeman: I was not surprised by the win\xe2\x80\xa2 Jamie Jackson: Saints change tack to sharpen Champions League focus</p>  2) Besic helps Everton respond to critics <p>Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez attributed Everton\xe2\x80\x99s necessary improvement against Manchester City in the Premier League and West Ham United in the FA Cup to the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cevery individual in the dressing room is taking the lead\xe2\x80\x9d. There is no doubt that Everton have responded to criticism of their organisation and willingness to fight since the dreadful league defeat at Hull City, although they head into Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s Cup replay with West Ham without a win in six matches, and playing to Romelu Lukaku\xe2\x80\x99s strengths has assisted the tentative recovery. But the contribution of Muhamed Besic should not be overlooked. The 22-year-old made only his ninth start in the Premier League on Saturday and endured a difficult first half against the champions but never hid and ultimately flourished in the central midfield contest against Fernandinho and Fernando. Everton have struggled without the injured James McCarthy this season but Besic, a \xc2\xa34m signing from Ferencvaros in the summer, more than compensated for his absence against City. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a character who is an out-and-out Everton player,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mart\xc3\xadnez. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is still developing and working but sometimes you forget he is only 22. When you have the bravery and want to do the right things it is impressive. I love those sort of characters \xe2\x80\x93 reliable. You can build strong teams around those characters.\xe2\x80\x9d Andy Hunter</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Manchester City agree \xc2\xa325m deal to sign Wilfried Bony from Swansea\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Everton 1-1 Manchester City\xe2\x80\xa2 Pellegrini rues missed chances by Manchester City in Everton draw</p>  3) Berahino: to sell or not to sell? <p>There are times when West Bromwich Albion have wondered whether the bad is starting to outweigh the good with Saido Berahino and if it is time to cash in on their biggest asset. Tony Pulis, the Albion head coach, has made it clear that he would like to keep Berahino at the club and find a striker to play alongside his leading scorer. Yet, at the same time, Pulis has stressed that every player has his price and, with that in mind, the Welshman cannot guarantee that Berahino will be an Albion player when the transfer window closes. There is no doubt that Berahino is a gifted young footballer and a natural goalscorer. What is not so clear is whether the 21-year-old, who is due in court next Monday to answer a drink-driving charge, is capable of showing the discipline and dedication to go with that talent. Within the club there is talk that Berahino has stepped back into line since Pulis took over. Either way, when contemplating Berahino\xe2\x80\x99s future, and the possibility of a big offer being tabled, it is hard to see how it makes sense for Albion to do anything other than keep Berahino at the club until the end of the season. This, after all, is the man who has scored nine of Albion\xe2\x80\x99s 20 league goals. Try picking up another striker in the January transfer window capable of that sort of return. Stuart James</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: West Bromwich Albion 1-0 Hull City\xe2\x80\xa2 Pulis insists he wants Berahino to stay\xe2\x80\xa2 Ched Evans\xe2\x80\x99 move to Oldham was supported by Hull manager Bruce</p>            Bruce disappointed with 1-0 defeat to West Bromwich Albion    4) Szczesny faces an uncertain future   <div data-embed-type="table" class="player-card player-card--football" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <div class="player-card__image-container">  </div> <div class="player-card__player"> <div class="player-card__position" itemprop="jobTitle">Goalkeeper</div> <div class="player-card__name" itemprop="name">Wojciech Szczesny</div> </div> <dl class="player-card__stats"> <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Appearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">17</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Saves</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">43</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Clearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">8</dd> </dl> </div>   <p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger must have known the question was coming but when it did, the Arsenal manager gave a passable impression of a rabbit in front of the headlights. How had the goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny reacted to being dropped for Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s visit of Stoke City? Wenger paused for what seemed like an age and, after no little shrugging, he said that he did not know. He then said: \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you take a decision? You know how you can take a decision.\xe2\x80\x9d Which seemed to mean: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think? Of course he took it badly.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Wenger, though, was in no mood to shed light on the situation. \xe2\x80\x9cLook, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk too much about that because the more I talk, the less I inform you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He did say that the decision had nothing to do with Szczesny\xe2\x80\x99s club fine for smoking in the dressing-room after his last appearance at Southampton on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, in the 2-0 defeat, but he did not want to give any clues as to the longer term.</p> <p>Would Szczesny\xe2\x80\x99s replacement, David Ospina, for whom Stoke was a Premier League debut, keep his place? \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d Wenger replied. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t made a decision yet. I made a decision for today\xe2\x80\x99s game. Szcsesny is our No1, he\xe2\x80\x99s competing with Ospina and [Emi] Mart\xc3\xadnez. We have to accept.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Against Stoke Ospina was under-employed but he did nothing wrong and it would now be a surprise if Wenger reinstated Szczesny at Manchester City next Sunday.

Photograph: Michael Zemanek/BPI/REX    <p>There were positives for Newcastle United to take from their 2-0 defeat at Chelsea and the biggest one was the performance of R\xc3\xa9my Cabella in the first half. The French winger has struggled to adapt to the Premier League since joining Newcastle last summer but he was a delight to watch at Stamford Bridge: tricky, inventive and always capable of beating a defender. He almost scored twice \xe2\x80\x93 Petr Cech had to be at his best to deny him when it was 0-0 \xe2\x80\x93 and John Carver said that Cabella had him on the edge of his seat when he was running with the ball. Now he has to do it on a consistent basis. He is more than good enough.

The return of a hero already had the home crowd in fervent mood and the noise reached another level after the match itself, a rousing victory over Tottenham that well and truly signalled the start of the Alan Pardew era at Crystal Palace. The crowd at Palace have been spoken about a lot since the London club\xe2\x80\x99s return to the Premier League, with Pardew even referring to them in his weekend programme notes, and specifically the Holmesdale Fanatics. With their support, wrote the manager, \xe2\x80\x9canything is possible\xe2\x80\x9d. That may be a clich\xc3\xa9d remark and a somewhat obvious attempt by Pardew to curry favour with an influential section of the club\xe2\x80\x99s fans but it is a statement that also contains a grain of truth and fully justified praise.</p> <p>The Fanatics really are a mesmerising bunch, creating a sea of chanting, drum-beating and flag-waving at one corner of the Holmesdale end that it can be difficult to take your eyes off. Crucially they stand out in an era when English crowds, especially those at the top level, have lost much of their fervour, due in part to all-seater stadiums and soaring ticket prices. Going to football matches in this country is a far safer experience than it once was but some of the excitement, the madcap wonder, has sadly disappeared too.</p> <p>Envy Palace fans, then, who know they are in for a more than decent atmosphere whenever they go to see their team at home. The Fanatics are largely to thank for this, and for neutrals they will be a significant loss to the Premier League should Pardew fail in his mission to keep Palace up this season.

On Saturday a crowd of 45,369 turned out in appalling weather to see a hugely disappointing Sunderland lose 1-0 to Liverpool. There were boos from the stands \xe2\x80\x93 which is understandable considering how poor Gus Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s players are at playing in front of what can be an immensely supportive crowd. Of the three Premier League games Sunderland have won this season \xe2\x80\x93 a woeful record which explains why they are on the fringe of the relegation zone \xe2\x80\x93 only one, against Stoke, has come at the Stadium of Light. Indeed, they registered only three League victories on Wearside during the whole of 2014. In 2013 the equivalent figure was four. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s true that, at home, we are not giving the fans much,\xe2\x80\x9d says Poyet. It is a self-destructive syndrome that took root during Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Neill\xe2\x80\x99s tenure and needs addressing. Otherwise Sunderland could easily find themselves in the Championship next season. Louise Taylor</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Sunderland 0-1 Liverpool\xe2\x80\xa2 Gus Poyet pleads for new personnel after Liverpool defeat</p>  8) Carroll for England again?   <div data-embed-type="table" class="player-card player-card--football" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <div class="player-card__image-container">  </div> <div class="player-card__player"> <div class="player-card__position" itemprop="jobTitle">Striker</div> <div class="player-card__name" itemprop="name">Andy Carroll</div> </div> <dl class="player-card__stats"> <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Appearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">11</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Goals</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">4</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">34</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots on target</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">26%</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Offsides</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">1</dd> </dl> </div>   <p>Is Andy Carroll good enough to merit a recall to the England squad? The West Ham behemoth is a Marmite man among the critics, either an anachronistic reminder of an undistinguished past that gave us John Fashanu and Mick Harford in the Three Lions shirt or a viable alternative to the quicker, nimbler likes of Danny Welbeck, Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling. It is unrealistic to expect Carroll to start for England but a case can be made for his presence on the bench, available to come on if the situation warrants changing to a more direct style of play. Certainly on the evidence of his renascent form, underlined by a high-class goal at Swansea on Saturday, he is at least as worthy as Rickie Lambert, who will be 33 next month.

The four-time Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or winner and the former Falkirk winger have not often been compared. But Arfield scored a terrific goal on Saturday. He was excellent, as he has been for much of the season, and industrious, as all of Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s players are. He outperformed a greater talent, in Adel Taarabt, whose ability is such that Milan signed him on loan last season. In contrast Arfield was signed on a free transfer from Huddersfield Town. While QPR\xe2\x80\x99s best buy in recent years, Charlie Austin, came from Burnley, their usual recruitment policy is to target the rich and famous. But deserving characters such as Arfield provide lessons to QPR, if they only choose to learn them. Richard Jolly</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Burnley 2-1 QPR</p>  10) Leicester earn reward of patience with Pearson <p>One has to admire the way Leicester City go about their business. Bottom of the Premier League they may remain but their style and confidence in beating Aston Villa on Saturday was commendable and warranted extending their unbeaten sequence to four games, including the FA Cup victory over Newcastle United. Admittedly, that was only their second home win of the season \xe2\x80\x93 who can forget the 5-3 triumph over Manchester United? \xe2\x80\x93 but Nigel Pearson continues to send his team out playing the brand of football that has worked for much of the past three years. Pearson can be taciturn with the media but his consistency with his players is a boon to the club. They went three months without a victory after that memorable day against United but he knew they were still playing well and he knew he retained the board\xe2\x80\x99s trust. \xe2\x80\x9cMargins are small and what\xe2\x80\x99s important for someone like myself is to have a perception of what we are,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI judge my players on what we feel they are capable of. When you endure difficult results, I actually know that we\xe2\x80\x99re not a million miles away.\xe2\x80\x9d Peter Lansley</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Leicester 1-0 Aston Villa\xe2\x80\xa2 The Dozen: the weekend\xe2\x80\x99s best Premier League photos</p>       Pos Team P GD Pts      1 Chelsea 21 27 49    2 Man City 21 25 47    3 Southampton 21 20 39    4 Man Utd 21 13 37    5 Arsenal 21 12 36    6 Tottenham Hotspur 21 1 34    7 West Ham 21 7 33    8 Liverpool 21 2 32    9 Swansea 21 1 30    10 Newcastle 21 -8 27    11 Stoke 21 -5 26    12 Everton 21 -4 22    13 Aston Villa 21 -12 22    14 West Brom 21 -9 21    15 Crystal Palace 21 -9 20    16 Sunderland 21 -13 20    17 Burnley 21 -14 20    18 Hull 21 -7 19    19 QPR 21 -14 19    20 Leicester 21 -13 17     '
