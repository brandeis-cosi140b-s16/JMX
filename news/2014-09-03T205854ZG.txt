b'Germany v Argentina \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened | Michael Butler'


b'<p>This was a young inexperienced German side, but they were completely blown away by Argentina and if I\xe2\x80\x99m honest, a 4-2 defeat flatters the hosts. It could have been so much worse. Durm was just awful at left back.</p> <p>Louis van Gaal will be studying this tape in the hope he can somehow recreate the conditions that allowed Di Maria to be so utterly brilliant, scored one and made the other three. Playing loosely off the right, but more or less given freedom to go whereever, he was man of the match by a country mile. </p> <p>There were also encouraging performances from Lamela, who took his goal really well, and Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s new centre-back F. Fernandez. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to tip your hat to Martino \xe2\x80\x93 in his first match as manager, he has completely outfoxed his World Cup winning counterpart. </p> <p>That said, I can\xe2\x80\x99t see this having a big effect on Germany: they will almost certainly wipe the floor with Scotland on Sunday, qualify easily for Euro 2016 and win the final!</p> <p>Night!</p>     Another amazing left-footed player in the Premier League.
