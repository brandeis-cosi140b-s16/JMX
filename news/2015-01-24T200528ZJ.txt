b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho lambasted his Chelsea players after they slid meekly out of the FA Cup, beaten 4-2 at home by Bradford City of League One.</p> <p>Mourinho usually defends his teams to the hilt but he labelled the display of the Premier League leaders \xe2\x80\x93 albeit with an understrength side containing nine changes \xe2\x80\x93 as \xe2\x80\x9cdisgraceful\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cunacceptable\xe2\x80\x9d after the visitors brilliantly fought back from 2-0 down after 38 minutes. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel happy for Bradford,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my bad feelings with the game and with the result, I can find space to feel happy for them. But on the other hand, I feel ashamed.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe players should feel exactly the same as I feel. This is the beauty of football, of the FA Cup. In not many sports is it possible that the best team loses to a team with completely different potential. But this is just one part of my feelings. I repeat the words that I used [on Friday] in the press conference: \xe2\x80\x98If we lose, it\xe2\x80\x99s a disgrace\xe2\x80\x99.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFor me, it\xe2\x80\x99s just unacceptable to lose against a team from a lower league. If I was you [a reporter], I would be very critical of Chelsea, with the Chelsea manager and the Chelsea players.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Defeat means Chelsea cannot win four trophies this season, though they still have the Capital One Cup, Premier League and Champions League to fight for. They take on Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday in the second leg of their League Cup semi-final, with the tie locked at 1-1.</p> <p>With that match in mind, Mourinho denied that fielding a weakened team on Saturday had played a part in Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s surprising downfall, their first home defeat of the season. \xe2\x80\x9cThe other players [who don\xe2\x80\x99t usually start] have to be ready to play,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have to be ready to play in any game. If they cannot play against a team from the Championship or League One or League Two, what do we do? The selection was good enough.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was basically the same team that played against Watford in the third round. And against Watford we won. I have spoken about rotation, I give chances to the players that don\xe2\x80\x99t play. So what I did was more than normal.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe players that played, we are not speaking about a team of kids. The selection was more than good enough. So I think the word football \xe2\x80\x98disgrace\xe2\x80\x99 is a good word for what happened to us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
