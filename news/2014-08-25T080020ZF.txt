b'Football transfer rumours:  Lukas Podolski to Wolfsburg or Juventus?'


b'<p>\xc3\x81ngel Di Mar\xc3\xada has been hogging the headlines, but his imminent \xc2\xa360m (and the rest, depending on your news source of choice) move to Manchester United is far from the only show in Transfer Town on this bank holiday Monday in Blighty. With Mario Balotelli on his way to Liverpool for the ludicrously cheap price of \xc2\xa316m, pink paper Gazzetta dello Sport reports that Milan will attempt to replace the Italian with either Chelsea striker Fernando Torres or his currently clubless former team-mate Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o. The pair don\xe2\x80\x99t strike the Rumour Mill as the most inspiring of targets but they are not the club\xe2\x80\x99s first choices. Milan have already been unsuccessful in their attempts to lure Jackson Mart\xc3\xadnez from Porto or Mattia Destro from Roma.</p> <p>The Italian sports daily also reports that Juventus are hoping to bring Colombian goal-getter Radamel Falcao to Turin on loan from Monaco, while closer to home this very website can reveal that the Old Lady is flirting with Arsenal in the hope of prising World Cup-winning German Lukas Podolski away from the Emirates. Bundesliga side Wolfsburg could yet throw a spanner in the works; with Arsenal taken by the cut of Luis Gustavo\xe2\x80\x99s jib, Podolski could move to the Volkswagen Arena in a swap deal with the midfielder.</p> <p>Southampton have offered Tottenham \xc2\xa312m for Andros Townsend, according to Sky Sports News reporter Bryan Swanson, who reckons the England midfielder will be going nowhere because Spurs say he\xe2\x80\x99s not for sale. With the arrival of his compatriot Balotelli certain to push Fabio Borini further down the pecking order at Anfield, the Italian striker may return to Sunderland on loan, despite having rejected a permanent move. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99re getting close to a final decision either way because it\xe2\x80\x99s been a bit too long,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gus Poyet, whose patience is wearing thin. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s time now that it\xe2\x80\x99s a yes coming or a no, as we need to move on.\xe2\x80\x9d Sunderland are also believed to be in talks with Lille\xe2\x80\x99s Salomon Kalou, although the former Chelsea winger is also wanted by Liverpool, Everton and Arsenal.</p> <p>Green splodges shaped like Manchester United striker Danny Welbeck and the aforementioned Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o are currently inching their way across the Everton radar, while Reading goalkeeper Alex McCarthy is wanted by QPR, whose fans booed their own manager, Harry Redknapp, on Sunday for waving to Tottenham fans.</p> <p>Micah Richards could leave Manchester City this week, with Sam Allardyce apparently eager to dress the defender in the livery of West Ham, while West Brom\xe2\x80\x99s Alan Irvine used his post-match press conference at Southampton on Saturday to tell reporters he has a few irons in the transfer market fire but refused to go into much more detail.</p> <p>And in managerial news, Ally McCoist insists he has no interest in leaving Rangers for Crystal Palace, while Steve Clarke used his appearance as the guest of Ben Shepherd and Chris Kamara on Goals On Sunday yesterday to throw his hat in the Selhurst Park circus ring. Elsewhere in London, Fulham manager Felix Magath is rumoured to have one match \xe2\x80\x93 if not tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s Capital One Cup exit at the hands of Brentford, then next Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s home defeat to Cardiff City \xe2\x80\x93 left to save his job after the Cottagers\xe2\x80\x99 disastrous start to the season. Magath\xe2\x80\x99s side have lost four matches out of four since returning to the Championship, with the low point being Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s 5-1 hammering at the hands of Derby County.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI am the right man for this job,\xe2\x80\x9d the German said in the wake of Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s horror show. \xe2\x80\x9cI do have pressure, but it is the pressure of wanting to play at the top of the division not at the bottom. I must ask for the forgiveness of the fans that spent time and money travelling up here because it has not been a good afternoon for them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
