b'Roy Keane the psychopath? That\xe2\x80\x99s the cartoon version, says Roddy Doyle'


b'<p>Book launches are nothing new or surprising to Roddy Doyle. But this one was a bigger event than usual because this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite the same sort of book as usual.</p> <p>This time, his remarkable protagonist \xe2\x80\x93 an exceptional athlete and renowned hardman, who nonetheless sports an epic survivalist beard and hipster corduroy jacket and displays the kind of insecurities you might more readily associate with a teenage boy \xe2\x80\x93 wasn\xe2\x80\x99t only on the page. Whereas Doyle would normally be the first port of call for anyone interested in his work, this time, in the shape of Roy Keane, he had some serious competition.</p> <p>Doyle stood unnoticed at the side of the room as Keane set about the attending journalists with exactly the vigorous defiance that the Booker prizewinning novelist had caught in prose, cheering the pair\xe2\x80\x99s publishers greatly by ensuring still more attention for their controversial collaboration, which has caused such a stir over the past week.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like having a fictional character come out of the book and say what a pleasure it was to work with you,\xe2\x80\x9d Doyle says a little later. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98My God, I invented you!\xe2\x80\x99 But obviously I didn\xe2\x80\x99t invent him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Listen to Roy Keane read the first chapter of his memoir The Second Half   <p>Even as a ghostwriter, the dramatising habits of fiction die hard. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a little evil man in me who would want to change the results a bit \xe2\x80\x93 to have Millwall beat them in the cup final,\xe2\x80\x9d Doyle says. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I think he\xe2\x80\x99d have spotted it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Instead, for The Second Half he adopted a way of working quite unlike anything required by his 10 novels, sitting with Keane for hours and trying to coax out the kinds of insights and revelations that would make the book sing, listening for the rhythm and vocabulary (expletives, quite often) that define his subject\xe2\x80\x99s idiosyncratic voice. (Listening back to tape after tape, he admits: \xe2\x80\x9cI never quite got to the stage of disliking him, but I did get a bit impatient.\xe2\x80\x9d) </p> <p>To do this, Doyle had to give as much as he got: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never liked the sound of my own voice, but I began to relax with that and realise that I was helping the conversation to roll. And I would ask the question and sometimes the answers would come.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>And, from the bitter criticism of Sir Alex Ferguson to his decision not to sign Robbie Savage at Sunderland because he said \xe2\x80\x9cwazzup\xe2\x80\x9d on his voicemail message, they often made for lively reading.</p> <p>Keane appreciated it, up to a point. \xe2\x80\x9cI probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go into it too much,\xe2\x80\x9d he tells the assembled reporters, but he found himself drawn out. Doyle, he says, \xe2\x80\x9cis obviously very clever, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I wanted to work with him, because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to down the standard sportswriter route.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>That\xe2\x80\x99s a reference to Eamon Dunphy, the ghostwriter on his previous book, who Keane blames for the FA charge over his brutal tackle on Alf-Inge H\xc3\xa5land that cost him \xc2\xa3150,000.</p> <p>That must have been an unnerving precedent \xe2\x80\x93 but, Keane says, when he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the mood, Doyle was able to win him over. \xe2\x80\x9cRoddy has a way about him, he\xe2\x80\x99s likeable, quite laid back, it was like a therapy session \xe2\x80\x93 I should have been charging him.\xe2\x80\x9d All the same, in a way that you might imagine would be a little frustrating to the writer who tried to capture him, Keane is resistant to the idea that a memoir ought to be personally revelatory. \xe2\x80\x9cIn terms of the real me,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9chopefully you\xe2\x80\x99ll never get to see that or get to know that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Doyle says affably, \xe2\x80\x9ceven people we know intimately all our lives, do we ever really know them? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. The only person who knows Roy is Roy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>But he must have had some sense of the man to write a 300-page book about him, surely. What was he like? \xe2\x80\x9cI remember a friend of mine asked me, what happens if you don\xe2\x80\x99t like him?\xe2\x80\x9d Doyle says. \xe2\x80\x9cBut actually I did, I liked him immediately, I came away from the first meeting thinking, yeah, this is a good guy, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t change my mind. In years to come, if Roy\xe2\x80\x99s mentioned in my company, I\xe2\x80\x99ll smile \xe2\x80\xa6 The psychopath, that\xe2\x80\x99s the cartoon version of Roy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s a cartoon for which Keane bears a large degree of responsibility, and there are plenty of stories in this book \xe2\x80\x93 such as when he goes for the traditional post-match drink in the rival manager\xe2\x80\x99s office and winds up holding a coach\xe2\x80\x99s head to the desk \xe2\x80\x93 that will burnish it further. But, Doyle argues, it is all a performance.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe talked about playing a role, like being an actor,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s very clear that on the pitch he was playing a role, even the skinhead is part of it. But all these men he\xe2\x80\x99d kicked, after his career he really began to enjoy their company. When he says he hated people, there\xe2\x80\x99s great respect in that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As a Chelsea fan, Doyle says, he always used to take \xe2\x80\x9ca certain pleasure in seeing him sent off\xe2\x80\x9d. But even then, he adds approvingly, \xe2\x80\x9che always seemed to home in on people you\xe2\x80\x99d like to see suffer a bit, like Alan Shearer. All the lads he went for had a certain git quality. His taste in enemies was quite good.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>So, Roy Keane as misunderstood hero, heroic scourge of obnoxious centre-forwards? It\xe2\x80\x99s an appealing idea \xe2\x80\x93 even if, just as Doyle\xe2\x80\x99s saying it, Keane is down the corridor with a group of sports reporters, energetically laying into Ferguson yet again, and this time with a bit less subtlety than the version presented by the book.</p> <p>Surely even Doyle wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t deny that there\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of the brute in him? A bit of a self-aggrandising strut? \xe2\x80\x9cWe always talk like someone is either arrogant or self-effacing,\xe2\x80\x9d he replies. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we can be both. Show me someone who can be described by one adjective and I\xe2\x80\x99ll show you someone dangerous. I think we all deserve a good few adjectives to describe us \xe2\x80\x93 and Roy as much as anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
