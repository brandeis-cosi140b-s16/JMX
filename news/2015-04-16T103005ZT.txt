b'The Premier League managers\xe2\x80\x99 table: Garry Monk top and Manuel Pellegrini bottom | Paul Wilson'


b'<p>This stage of the season, just before the FA Cup semi-finals and with the top and bottom placings in the Premier League still to be resolved, seems as good a time as any to look at which managers have enhanced their reputations over the last few months. Or the last few weeks in the cases of Dick Advocaat and Tim Sherwood.</p> <p>This is not a precise science. The league table at the end of the season ought to show exactly who has done well and who needs to do better, but while the table might never lie it does not always tell the full story.</p> <p>Last year, for example, the Premier League manager of the season did not actually win anything, did not even finish in the top half of the table, and you would be hard pressed to work out from the final standings alone why Tony Pulis was considered to have had a more impressive season than, say, Manuel Pellegrini or Brendan Rodgers.</p> <p>So purely as a hypothetical exercise before the actual gongs are handed out \xe2\x80\x93 or the contract is terminated, whatever the case may be \xe2\x80\x93 let us reorganise the league table a little in terms of managerial performance so far. The criterion here is improvement, both at a club level and a personal one. Which managers are sitting prettier now than they were at the start of the season, in other words.</p> <p>There is an enormous disparity within Premier League clubs in terms of finance, experience and aspiration, but based simply on whether supporters are happy with the way their season has gone or fed up with the bloke in charge it ought to be possible to draw up a ranking list. So here goes, starting from the top \xe2\x80\xa6</p> 1 Garry Monk <p>Has got to be the most enhanced managerial reputation because this time last year he had no managerial reputation. People feared he might be a the wrong choice or a suspiciously cheap one, yet with six games to go Swansea are sitting in their highest ever Premier League position, have matched their record points total, and have coped with losing their main striker. Impressive from a manager in his first full season.</p> 2 Alan Pardew <p>Many would argue the Crystal Palace manager ought to be in top spot, after a defining season that seems to have elevated him from the safe-pair-of-hands category to the go-to man for instant results. Clearly a good fit at Palace, and the much-quoted stat that reveals his points total for both his clubs this season stands at 51 would put a combined Newcastle-Palace above Swansea in the table.</p>  <p> Related: Alan Pardew deserves credit, and not just for revival at Crystal Palace | Sean Ingle </p>   3 Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger <p>Yes, above Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho. Arsenal have won their past eight matches in the league \xe2\x80\x93 one more would equal a record set in their Invincible season \xe2\x80\x93 and are in the last four of the FA Cup. European progress is still a problem and Chelsea are still favourites for the league, but the fans are not on Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s back any more. The manager has dug himself out of a hole (again) and should that ninth win in a row be achieved it could be even more interesting, because the opponents are Chelsea.</p> 4 Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho <p>Not doing anything particularly wrong, apart from going out of Europe at an unexpectedly early stage, but not pulling up many trees, either. This might be unfair on the manager who is top of the league but it is what happens when you set such brilliantly high standards for yourself. No one at Chelsea is moaning but a bit more excitement would not go amiss. Mourinho taking another title in his stride, along with the Capital One Cup, is simply what people expected. Par for the course.</p> 5 Louis van Gaal <p>Definitely an improvement on last season but much more important a huge improvement in the past few weeks on what was going on at Manchester United in the first half of the season. From chaos and confusion have come order, elegance and channelled excitement. United look better now than they did in the last couple of seasons under Sir Alex Ferguson. Money doubtless helps but how many other managers would have the bottle to leave \xc3\x81ngel Di Mar\xc3\xada and Radamel Falcao out of the side?</p> 6 Ronald Koeman <p>Remember the Southampton supporters refusing to buy season tickets at the start of the season? Enough said, and the Saints\xe2\x80\x99 season could still get better.</p> 7 Brendan Rodgers <p>Still signs of tactical nous but unless Liverpool can squeeze into the top four not even winning the FA Cup would match last season\xe2\x80\x99s highs. Mario Balotelli, anyone?</p> 8 Sean Dyche <p>Little known outside east Lancashire this time last season, now Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s manager is admired for producing gutsy performances every week from everyone\xe2\x80\x99s second-favourite team.</p> 9 Sam Allardyce <p>Sorry, West Ham fans, but the table suggests you are still improving. Have a chat with a few Bolton supporters and be careful what you wish for.</p> 10 Mauricio Pochettino <p>Seems to have slotted easily into the Tottenham template, which is to do all right most of the time but nothing too dramatic or game-changing. Good work with Harry Kane, if saying so is all right with Tim Sherwood.</p> 11 Mark Hughes <p>Not quite pushed on this year as noticeably as he did last. Stoke probably need an inspired signing or two to climb out of their mid-table comfort zone.</p> 12 Tim Sherwood <p>Agreed, the number of games is too small a sample to be representative. And Aston Villa are not quite safe yet. But they are at Wembley this weekend, scoring goals at last and beginning to enjoy themselves. It may prove only to be a mini upturn, but upturn it is, so well done the new man.</p> 13 Tony Pulis <p>Could do no wrong last season and West Brom may have made the mistake of thinking his mere presence would keep them out of trouble. Still look likely to be safe but the last couple of results would blot any copybook.</p> 14 Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez <p>Everton are no longer in relegation trouble, but the fact they were ever worried speaks volumes about their uneven season. Goodison faithful yet to be convinced Mart\xc3\xadnez can organise a defence or be trusted in the transfer market.</p> 15 Nigel Pearson <p>Spent much of the season digging a hole for himself, now showing signs he may be able to climb out. Leicester may, too, but they have left it very late.</p> 16 Dick Advocaat <p>Not bottom of this list because that would be rude when the guy has only just arrived in the country. Not enough games to judge, anyway, and Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s last two performances have been wildly inconsistent.</p> 17 Steve Bruce <p>Signed a new contract, photographed on the beach in the international break, Hull have not won in five games. Not looking great.</p> 18 John Carver <p>Probably not going to get the job permanently on the basis of what Newcastle have shown since Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s departure. That said, Newcastle could easily have taken a point or more from Anfield on Monday.</p> 19 Chris Ramsey <p>See above. Another nice guy in a difficult situation, but improvement from QPR? Only in the last couple of weeks and that might not be enough.</p> 20 Manuel Pellegrini  <p> Related: Manchester City could sack Pellegrini before end of season if top-four spot in jeopardy </p>   <p>Not a great week, not a great season. Manchester City will now be linked with J\xc3\xbcrgen Klopp, or anyone else who becomes available, even as Pellegrini prepares to win the remaining six games that will ensure Champions League football next season, presumably for his successor. Improvement is City\xe2\x80\x99s buzzword and it has been conspicuous by its absence all season. Pellegrini is by no means the worst manager on this list but he took on the job with his eyes open and can see it has not gone to plan. When you dream big and spend big, when you fail you fail big.</p>'
