b'<p>Jak Alnwick will retain his place in goal for Newcastle United against Sunderland at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park on Sunday after being passed fit by the club\xe2\x80\x99s medical staff.</p> <p>Alan Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s third-choice keeper, who has conceded eight goals in his last two games, suffered a shoulder injury during Wednesday night\xe2\x80\x99s 4-0 Capital One Cup quarter final defeat to Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane.</p> <p>With his fourth choice, Freddie Woodman, only 17, Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s manager had been poised to make a renewed attempt to persuade the Premier League to allow him to borrow a goalkeeper from another club under the emergency loan system.</p> <p>Injuries to Tim Krul and Rob Elliot \xe2\x80\x93 expected to sideline them until late January \xe2\x80\x93 prompted Newcastle to explore the possibility of such a loan with Pardew reputedly keen on Wigan\xe2\x80\x99s Ali al-Habsi as temporary cover.</p> <p>This proved a non-starter because as, long as Alnwick is fit, such an approach would be automatically rejected on the grounds that Newcastle also have Woodman and Karl Darlow on their books, even though the latter is on a season-long loan at Nottingham Forest. The fact Woodman is only 17 does not count as he has already signed a professional contract.</p> <p>Alnwick impressed on his debut \xe2\x80\x93 when he replaced Elliot at half time at home to Chelsea a fortnight ago and shone in a 2-1 Newcastle win \xe2\x80\x93 but struggled during the subsequent Premier League trip to Arsenal and Cup game at Spurs.</p> <p>Alnwick, who was born in Hexham, grew up as a Newcastle fan but he was part of Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s academy before switching to St James\xe2\x80\x99 in 2008. With his former club having won their last three Tyne-Wear derbies against Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s team, Sunday promises to be a difficult day for a keeper literally thrown in at the deep end.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Hatem Ben Arfa is set for a January move after finding himself unwanted at Newcastle and Hull. The 27-year-old is set for a transfer after Pardew said he did not want to take him back from his loan at Hull, where the manager Steve Bruce has written him out of his plans.</p> <p>His agent Michel Ouzaine told 20minutes.fr: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are a lot of clubs interested in him, despite everything that has been said. He will have a new club in January, that won\xe2\x80\x99t be a problem, don\xe2\x80\x99t you worry.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ben Arfa has played just nine times for Hull since his loan move from the Magpies and Bruce admitted on Thursday that the relationship between player and club had almost certainly run its course.</p> <p>He denied media reports of a row with Ben Arfa, but is understood to be dismayed by the midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s lack of work ethic \xe2\x80\x93 in training and in matches. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he decides to stay in France that\xe2\x80\x99s up to him, there\xe2\x80\x99s only 10 days until the window opens and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say he\xe2\x80\x99s probably played his last game for Hull,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruce.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to be in the team on merit. It\xe2\x80\x99s my job to pick a team which I think will win a game on the Saturday. All this reported bust-up and the rest of it \xe2\x80\xa6 I think you want to make that story.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I\xe2\x80\x99ve said to Ben Arfa is unfortunately I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to accept a performance like I saw from him against Manchester United. It\xe2\x80\x99s up to him to force himself back into the squad, that\xe2\x80\x99s the way it is. Sometimes transfers don\xe2\x80\x99t work, especially with a loan deal. Sometimes they can be the best thing for the player and the club. Unfortunately it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t worked out. I wish him the best of luck. I hope he goes on to have the career his talent deserves, that\xe2\x80\x99s all I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to say on the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
