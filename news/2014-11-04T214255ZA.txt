b'Arsenal v Anderlecht: Champions League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened | Jacob Steinberg'


b'<p>What a bunch of LOSERS. What a cowardly, wet, spineless collapse that was from Arsenal. To be honest, they were never convincing tonight, despite racing into a 3-0 lead after 58 minutes. Anderlecht were always threatening and once they got one back, Arsenal caved in. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same old story for Arsenal: the lack of leadership is painful and the failure to sign a commanding central midfielder and another centre-back in the summer continues to make Wenger look foolish. Credit to Anderlecht, though, because that was an astonishing comeback. They had to be good and they were. It means that Arsenal aren\xe2\x80\x99t certain of going through yet - they are five points clear of Anderlecht with two games to go. They should do it but with Borussia Dortmund winning against Galatasaray tonight, it looks like Arsenal are going to have to settle for second place again. That\xe2\x80\x99s Arsenal. Good old Arsenal! Thanks for reading. Night.</p>'
