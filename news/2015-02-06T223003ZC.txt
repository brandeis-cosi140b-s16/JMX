b'Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho returns reluctantly to the media fray'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has made a prickly comeback to media duties by offering a familiar reminder that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger escaped sanction for appearing to push the Chelsea manager on the touchline earlier this season, and reaffirming his belief that clubs who flout Uefa\xe2\x80\x99s financial fair play rules, implying Manchester City, should be docked points.</p> <p>The Portuguese, who will attempt to win his first league game at Villa Park on Saturday at the sixth attempt, had risked a Premier League fine for choosing not to address the media either side of last Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s draw with City, having been unhappy with the portrayal of Diego Costa\xe2\x80\x99s challenge on Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Emre Can in the Capital One Cup semi-final. That was adjudged a stamp by the Football Association, resulting in the striker receiving a three-match ban; on the day that Costa was charged, Mourinho was fined \xc2\xa325,000 by the FA for suggesting in December that there was a \xe2\x80\x9cclear campaign\xe2\x80\x9d against his side.</p> <p>He returned reluctantly to Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s media theatre on Friday out of obligation, declaring he was not \xe2\x80\x9csuper happy to be here\xe2\x80\x9d, and initially offering only curt responses to broadcasters. He declared the \xc2\xa323.3m signing of Juan Cuadrado to be \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d and there was no desire to reflect upon last season\xe2\x80\x99s fractious 1-0 loss at Villa, in which two of his players were dismissed and the manager was sent to the stands. Asked if he expected to be fined for swerving his duties last week, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know the only surprise I had in relation to that was not to be punished when I was pushed by another manager. Apart from that I can expect everything.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho was more forthcoming when it came to Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s successes in the transfer market in recent times, the league leaders having emerged from the midwinter market with a profit of \xc2\xa37.2m \xe2\x80\x93 courtesy largely of the sales of Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle and Ryan Bertrand \xe2\x80\x93 despite their successful pursuit of Cuadrado, one of the stellar performers at last summer\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup finals. That was the third window in succession in which Chelsea have recorded a profit in player trading, contrasting markedly with the \xc2\xa328m spent by City on Wilfried Bony last month, and prompted a familiar refrain from Mourinho on the machinations of FFP.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something that was explained 18 months ago when I met our owner and the club board before I joined,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was explained the profile of club Mr Abramovich wants, with total respect to the FFP rules. Our work to keep the team strong, with a possibility to compete against the ones financially more powerful or against the ones who don\xe2\x80\x99t care and don\xe2\x80\x99t respect FFP \xe2\x80\xa6 we had to work very hard. In my area, I tried to do that. Analysing the players we can sell and those we can buy. But when it goes to numbers, it goes out of my control. I think total credit to the people who deserve credit in that area. I\xe2\x80\x99m not the one.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good challenge. The only thing that is not nice is that you compete against [clubs] who don\xe2\x80\x99t follow the same rules. That\xe2\x80\x99s the only problem. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think a team can be champions when you are punished \xe2\x80\x93 and it\xe2\x80\x99s happened before [implying City last season] \xe2\x80\x93 because the team didn\xe2\x80\x99t comply with FFP.\xe2\x80\x9d Asked what sanction would be more appropriate than the fine imposed upon City by Uefa last summer, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cPoints. Of course. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know [how many].\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He travels to Villa Park without Costa, who is serving the second match of his three-game ban, and having taken a sarcastic swipe at Manuel Pellegrini for the Manchester City manager\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that the Spain forward must learn from his misdemeanour. \xe2\x80\x9cI appreciate the lesson that Mr Pellegrini wanted to give to one of my players, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do the same or give any kind of word about it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho, who merely shook his head when asked if Costa did, indeed, have to change his game to escape further controversy in future.</p> <p>Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my and Didier Drogba are competing for the striker\xe2\x80\x99s berth, while Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas will undergo a late fitness test to determine whether he can feature after hamstring trouble. Cuadrado will be in the squad but is expected to start the game on the bench. \xe2\x80\x9cI think he is ready to play, unless the Premier League or FA say some rule stops him,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will have his time.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a panic buy. It\xe2\x80\x99s a reaction to Sch\xc3\xbcrrle\xe2\x80\x99s departure \xe2\x80\x93 he was a player we liked, but the business was very good \xe2\x80\x93 and he is a player we\xe2\x80\x99ve known for a long, long time. We are happy with our business.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
