b'<p>Brendan Rodgers said Liverpool are feeling the absence of Daniel Sturridge, adding his side must remain in contention towards the top of the Premier League until the striker returns.</p> <p>Sturridge has not played for Liverpool since late August after suffering a thigh injury when on England duty at the start of September before picking up a calf problem on his return to training.</p> <p>In his absence Liverpool have managed seven goals in six Premier League matches while the \xc2\xa316m summer signing Mario Balotelli has scored once in 11 appearances, that effort coming in the Champions League win over Ludogorets.</p> <p>The 0-0 home draw with Hull City left Liverpool in seventh place, nine points behind the leaders Chelsea, and Rodgers has already moved to temper expectations at Anfield following last season\xe2\x80\x99s second place.</p> <p>Sturridge scored 24 goals last season and Rodgers, who is refusing to put on timescale on the striker\xe2\x80\x99s return, admits Liverpool are hamstrung without him.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you are under the cosh, you know that you have strikers who can score out of nothing. It is a big weapon. Sturridge is one of them,\xe2\x80\x9d Rodgers told the club\xe2\x80\x99s website. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is where we aim to get with Daniel. When he comes back into the team, you will see the confidence because of the movement and the dynamic.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe just have to work without [him] and while we are doing that, we are staying up and around the top end of the table.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
