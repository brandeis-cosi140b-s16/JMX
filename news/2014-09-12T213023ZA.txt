b'Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s case of lunchtime fixture indigestion needs a cure'


b'<p>Arsenal have lost 10 of their 39 Premier League games played at 12.45pm since 2004-05 \xe2\x80\x93 and half of those defeats have come in the last two seasons. This is how Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger and company have spent their most recent lunchtime fixtures:</p> 29 Sep 2012 \xe2\x80\x93 LOST 2-1 v Chelsea (h) <p>Fernando Torres capitalised on poor defending to open the scoring and, although Gervinho cracked in an equaliser, Juan Mata\xe2\x80\x99s second-half set-piece evaded everybody to send the points to west London.</p> 3 Nov 2012 \xe2\x80\x93 LOST 2-1 v Manchester United (a) <p>Robin van Persie scored against his old club to get Arsenal off to a nightmare start. It should have been several more as the Gunners stayed in a slumber throughout. Patrice Evra did double United\xe2\x80\x99s lead, and Santi Cazorla\xe2\x80\x99s fine late goal gave the visitors some superficial respectability.</p> 17 Nov 2012 \xe2\x80\x93 WON 5-2 v Tottenham Hotspur (h) <p>This time Arsenal rose to the occasion of a high-profile lunchtime, although it did not seem that way when Emmanuel Adebayor scored early on. But he was then sent off and the hosts scored five through Per Mertesacker, Lukas Podolski, Olivier Giroud, Cazorla and Theo Walcott, with a Gareth Bale reply meaning little.</p> 22 Dec 2012 \xe2\x80\x93 WON 1-0 v Wigan Athletic (a) <p>Arsenal had endured a few scares at Wigan in the past, but there was no such problem this time around. A scrappy game was settled by Mikel Arteta\xe2\x80\x99s penalty on the hour mark, and the Gunners\xe2\x80\x99 lunchtime record for the season was won two, lost two.</p> 24 Aug 2013 \xe2\x80\x93 WON 3-1 v Fulham (a) <p>Straightforward stuff against a side that went on to be relegated. Giroud scored early, Podolski\xe2\x80\x99s left foot rapped another couple in, and Darren Bent\xe2\x80\x99s customary goal against Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s side was of scant consequence.</p> 26 Oct 2013 \xe2\x80\x93 WON 2-0 v Crystal Palace (a) <p>Another unfussy away win, sparked by a second-half Mikel Arteta penalty. The Spaniard was later sent off, but Giroud struck a second to seal a comfortable win.</p> 14 Dec 2013 \xe2\x80\x93 LOST 6-3 v Manchester City (a) <p>The day the rot set in. All seemed well enough when Walcott equalised Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero\xe2\x80\x99s opener, but \xc3\x81lvaro Negredo scored shortly before the break. Then Fernandinho got in on the act before Walcott made it interesting with a fine strike. David Silva and another Fernandinho goal took it away from Arsenal again and, although Mertesacker scored late on, Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s penalty had the final say. Wenger described defeat as an \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> 8 Feb 2014 \xe2\x80\x93 LOST 5-1 v Liverpool (a) <p>A rather more serious accident. Liverpool ripped Arsenal to shreds in an incredible opening 20 minutes, Martin Skrtel scoring twice before Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge joined in. Sterling scored again after the interval before Arsenal replied through their lunchtime staple, an Arteta penalty. They might as well have stayed in bed.</p> 22 March 2014 \xe2\x80\x93 LOST 6-0 v Chelsea (a) <p>Possibly worst of them all, even if Arsenal had 10 men for 73 minutes when Kieran Gibbs was sent off instead of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. They were already three down by the time the numerical advantage kicked in, thanks to Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o, Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle and Eden Hazard (pen). Oscar, with two, and Mohamed Salah compounded the misery.</p>'
