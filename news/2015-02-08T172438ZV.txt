b'<p>Second-placed Roma ended their run of four successive Serie A draws when they ground out a 2-1 win at Gianfranco Zola\xe2\x80\x99s Cagliari. Adem Ljajic and teenager Leandro Paredes scored in each half for Roma, who remain seven points adrift of Juventus after the league leaders beat Milan 3-1 on Saturday.</p>  <p> Related: Juventus 3-1 Milan | Serie A </p>   <p>While Ljajic and Paredes scored the goals, Roma manager Rudi Garc\xc3\xada\xe2\x80\x99s selection of 18-year-old Daniele Verde may have made the difference. Starting his first Serie A match, forward Verde set up both goals for the visitors. The first came when Verde chipped the ball over the Cagliari defence and into the path of Ljajic, who fired into the roof of the net.</p> <p>The Sardinian side, one point and one place above the relegation zone, dominated the second half and Duje Cop should have levelled but instead skied his effort with only Roma goalkeeper Morgan De Sanctis to beat.</p> <p>Instead, Paredes wrapped up the points when he met Verde\xe2\x80\x99s cross with a volley which went in off the foot of the post. It was the Argentinean midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s first goal for the club since his move from Boca Juniors in July. Paul-Jose M\xe2\x80\x99Poku scored a consolation for the hosts in stoppage time. After the match, Garc\xc3\xada offered praise for the roles played in the win by teenagers Verde and Paredes, saying \xe2\x80\x9cVerde is an important member of the squad \xe2\x80\xa6 aside from his speed and technique, he works very hard\xe2\x80\x9d. Garc\xc3\xada added that \xe2\x80\x9cthe young players have shown they can step up\xe2\x80\x9d when senior players are injured.</p>  <p> Related: Milan unveil plans for new stadium \xe2\x80\x98inspired by the Emirates in London\xe2\x80\x99 </p>   <p>Third-placed Napoli beat Udinese 3-1 at home with the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 striker Cyril Thereau scoring at both ends. The hosts opened up an early two-goal lead through Dries Mertens and Manolo Gabbiadini, but Thereau brought Udinese back into the game before the half hour, only to turn a Mertens ball into his own goal in the second half.</p> <p>Manual Pasqual scored an 89th-minute winner to give Fiorentina a 3-2 win over Atalanta as Mohamed Salah made his debut for the hosts following his move from Chelsea, while fellow Champions League chasers Sampdoria drew 1-1 at home to Sassuolo.</p>'
