b'Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Edin Dzeko ready to fill Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero void at Roma'


b'<p>Edin Dzeko has vowed to fill the void left by the injured Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero and be the hero in Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s final Champions League group game against Roma at the Stadio Olimpico on Wednesday night.</p> <p>If City win against Rudi Garc\xc3\xada\xe2\x80\x99s side and better CSKA Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s result at Bayern Munich then next year\xe2\x80\x99s knockout phase will be reached. But they will be without Ag\xc3\xbcero, who has scored 19 goals in 21 appearances, after the Argentinian suffered knee ligament damage in Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s win over Everton.</p> <p>Manuel Pellegrini said at Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s pre-match press conference that Ag\xc3\xbcero would be out for four to six weeks, although City\xe2\x80\x99s manager later voiced fears that the layoff could be as long as eight weeks.</p> <p>Dzeko is not 100% match-fit following a calf injury but should start and has a history of important strikes. When City claimed the title in 2011-12 he scored a 90th-minute equaliser in the final match against Queens Park Rangers before Ag\xc3\xbcero\xe2\x80\x99s added-time winner. Last season Dzeko registered nine goals in City\xe2\x80\x99s last 11 matches to help push the team to the championship.</p> <p>Asked if he could again be the hero for Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s side against Roma, the Bosnian said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m there when the team needs me and first of all I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to be back because I was never actually injured so long [a month] \xe2\x80\x93 it was a bit hard for me but now I\xe2\x80\x99m back and I\xe2\x80\x99ll do my best to try and score the goals and bring something good to the team.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI did [score big goals] but that\xe2\x80\x99s past now and we have to look to the future, and like I said I always try to do my job and my job is to score goals and I will keep scoring them I\xe2\x80\x99m sure if I keep healthy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Dzeko\xe2\x80\x99s first appearance since 8 November was as a substitute on Saturday, after 63 minutes. \xe2\x80\x9cI expected even less than 30 minutes; I was saying 15 minutes would be OK for me just to get back on the pitch and I already played 30. The feeling was OK but I still need some more games to come back,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>On whether he can play all of the match against Rome, Dzeko said: \xe2\x80\x9cAgainst Everton definitely not but Wednesday, who knows? We still have days [of] training so I will be better by Wednesday.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Vincent Kompany, David Silva, Stevan Jovetic and Fernandinho, who had been doubtful, trained on Monday morning so they should be available to Pellegrini on Wednesday night. Dzeko believes the high-pressure stakes in Rome can bring the best out of City who defeated Bayern Munich in Group E\xe2\x80\x99s previous round which had also been a must-win game.</p> <p>He said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a special situation, in the league and Champions League because we were just trying to play but when we were eight points behind [Chelsea] we knew: \xe2\x80\x98OK, now we have to start playing.\xe2\x80\x99 And in the Champions League as well, we lost the game at home to CSKA and then you have to win the next game, and we won it, so maybe we need that pressure: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to explain.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe will definitely try to go there and score goals because if you don\xe2\x80\x99t score the goals you can\xe2\x80\x99t win the games. It will be a big game for them as well \xe2\x80\x93 I think the atmosphere will be amazing and that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s football\xe2\x80\x99s about, and those kind of games we want to play.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI played many games with the good atmosphere but actually I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to that game because they have great fans with a big stadium so it will hopefully be a night to remember.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDefinitely confidence is high \xe2\x80\x93 we won five in a row. It\xe2\x80\x99s better confidence, better atmosphere in the team when you\xe2\x80\x99re winning the games and I think we\xe2\x80\x99re coming back to our normal performances especially after our national teams\xe2\x80\x99 break and hopefully we can be even better in the next week. There will be some big games, crucial games.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of Ag\xc3\xbcero\xe2\x80\x99s injury, Dzeko said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat was a big blow for us \xe2\x80\x93 you can see how he played recently for us. [But] I\xe2\x80\x99m back now, Alex [Kolarov] is back now, hopefully David will be back.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
