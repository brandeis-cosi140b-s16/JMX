b'Manchester United 3-0 Liverpool: five talking points | Jamie Jackson'


b'1 Can United fight for the Premier League, at least? <p>Beforehand Michael Carrick was asked by United Review what the club magazine termed a \xe2\x80\x9csimple question: are we in the title race?\xe2\x80\x9d The midfielder said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf we are in and around the top by Christmas or January then we are right in there with a chance.\xe2\x80\x9d Well, with Saint Nicholas due down chimneys imminently this was United\xe2\x80\x99s sixth consecutive league victory, with the final match before the big day being Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s visit of Aston Villa. Make that a seventh three-pointer in a row and United cement third place in December\xe2\x80\x99s final days. On Friday Louis van Gaal was given the same poser as Carrick and hardly knocked the notion of his team being in championship contention. Chelsea and Manchester City may \xe2\x80\x93 just may \xe2\x80\x93 be looking over their shoulders a little now.</p> 2 Where does Brendan Rodgers go from here? <p>Surely a man voted LMA manager of the Year in May cannot be removed in December? The United fans seem to think so, though they would, of course. \xe2\x80\x9cGetting sacked in the morning\xe2\x80\x9d was the gleeful chant after a Juan Mata header was ruled (probably wrongly) onside and Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99s team were 2-0 behind. Of a Liverpool that featured Raheem Sterling as the lone man up top, as Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert kept warm on the bench, Rodgers said: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the last four or five games we\xe2\x80\x99ve looked to become a bit more solid and we\xe2\x80\x99ve done that, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got some results. But I think we were moving away from the way we were creative over the past couple of years and now we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go back to what we do best.\xe2\x80\x9d A focus on winning at all costs would currently seem a better route to follow.</p> 3 James Wilson offered chance to cement his place <p>Van Gaal could not have been clearer: \xe2\x80\x9cRadamel Falcao is fit to start. We need James Wilson in this match because of his speed.\xe2\x80\x9d After the 19-year-old shone in his previous outing, the 2-1 win over Stoke City, Wilson played alongside a resurgent Robin van Persie. During the first half he was given scant service though was willing to make the kind of runs that can open up a match and so delights the manager. Yet there was a feeling after the break that unless he somehow made an impact Wilson would be replaced. This, perhaps, moved him to flail at a 30-yard shot that went wide before he was replaced by Ander Herrera. Now, though, Falcao knows he has serious competition from the boy from Biddulph.</p>           Louis van Gaal explains his decision to play Wayne Rooney in midfield against Liverpool    4 Simon Mignolet the fall guy <p>As with the XI Rodgers sent out at Real Madrid in the Champions League, the manager has illustrated he is not afraid of a brave selection. To choose Brad Jones \xe2\x80\x93 a goalkeeper who last featured in the Premier League in March 2013 \xe2\x80\x93 illustrated how Rodgers views Simon Mignolet\xe2\x80\x99s form. Within 12 minutes Jones was watching a Wayne Rooney rocket pass him with the sense that he may have misjudged the ball\xe2\x80\x99s flight. \xe2\x80\x9cI just felt we needed to change that area. Brad\xe2\x80\x99s been very loyal in my time here as a number two and when he\xe2\x80\x99s come in he\xe2\x80\x99s done very well. I think the rest will do Simon good, coming out of the spotlight for a little while,\xe2\x80\x9d Rodgers said. Mignolet might be back in focus soon as Jones was also wrong-footed for Robin van Persie\xe2\x80\x99s third.</p> 5 Injury curse strikes again, but Phil Jones survives <p>Of United\xe2\x80\x99s 3-4-1-2, in which Rooney played particularly deep, Van Gaal said: \xe2\x80\x9cMy plan you shall see on the pitch. I have to change at the last moment because Marcos Rojo was injured in training so I have to change my lineup again.\xe2\x80\x9d This meant Jones was pressed into action despite the information before the match being that there was only a \xe2\x80\x9cremote\xe2\x80\x9d chance of him being involved should another defender go down. Given the 22-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s rustiness he might have understandably been off the pace but the terrific sliding tackle that had to be expertly timed on Sterling as he sprinted into the area illustrated Jones\xe2\x80\x99s class.</p> <p>Towards the end the defender was taken off having played his part in a fine win.</p>'
