b'Football transfer rumours: Man Utd and Chelsea after Bastian Schweinsteiger?'


b'<p>Sometimes you just need a change of scene. The Mill, for example, still enjoys purveying its football tittle-tattle every morning but we\xe2\x80\x99ve also heard that there\xe2\x80\x99s some sort of large event occurring in British politics later this year and we quite fancy a shot at that. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Mill at Westminster\xe2\x80\x9d has quite a nice ring to it, don\xe2\x80\x99t you think? And we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the right skill set: Bob Jones set for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland? Tewkesbury set to swoop for Reginald Pottersmithe? Katherine Watson set for Dudley South exit? That sort of thing.</p> <p>Anyway, the point is: sometimes you just need a change of scene. Bastian Schweinsteiger certainly does. He\xe2\x80\x99s out of contract at Bayern Munich in the summer and the Premier League big boys are \xe2\x80\x9con alert\xe2\x80\x9d after hints that he could be prepared to move abroad. Manchester United and Chelsea are on the trail.</p> <p>Joann\xe2\x80\x99s got it. Leonice\xe2\x80\x99s got it. Tonia\xe2\x80\x99s got it. I tell ya, Cheryl\xe2\x80\x99s got it. Boy I tell you Betty\xe2\x80\x99s for it. Chip has got it. And Ann\xe2\x80\x99s got it. Gail\xe2\x80\x99s got it. Stephanie\xe2\x80\x99s got it. And Sabrina\xe2\x80\x99s got it. Rachelle has got it. Yeah, Gladys sure got it. Fontina\xe2\x80\x99s got it. Aaliyah\xe2\x80\x99s got it. Stacy\xe2\x80\x99s got it. I tell ya Tita\xe2\x80\x99s got it. Rita\xe2\x80\x99s got it. Laurel\xe2\x80\x99s got it. Kim\xe2\x80\x99s got it, yeah. They\xe2\x80\x99ve all got that vibe, and next season Swansea will have it too. That\xe2\x80\x99s because Gary Monk wants the Gothenburg hotshot Lasse Vibe as a long-term replacement for Wilfried Bony. The Denmark striker will cost around \xc2\xa32.5m.</p> <p>West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s deal for Lassana Diarra has collapsed owing to pesky paperwork but Sam Allardyce remains keen on signing someone with a bit of Champions League pedigree. The Manchester United striker Javier Hern\xc3\xa1ndez is the latest man on Big Sam\xe2\x80\x99s shopping list and, with Real Madrid not keen on turning the Mexico striker\xe2\x80\x99s loan move into a permanent one at the end of the season, the Hammers fancy their chances of landing Chicharito.</p> <p>Arsenal want Real\xe2\x80\x99s F\xc3\xa1bio Coentr\xc3\xa3o. But Ignazio Abate looks to be staying at Milan.</p> <p>And in managerial news, Tim Sherwood has been installed as the favourite to step into Paul Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s shoes at Villa Park. J\xc3\xbcrgen Klinsmann, Neil Lennon and David Moyes are all in the hunt too. While at QPR, any move for Michael Laudrup is going to have to wait until the summer as the former Swansea manager is determined to see out his contract in Qatar with Lekhwiya.</p>'
