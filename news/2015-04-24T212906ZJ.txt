b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has dismissed Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion it is \xe2\x80\x9ceasy to defend\xe2\x80\x9d and moved to justify Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s switch from an expansive to a more pragmatic style over recent weeks as they home in on a first Premier League title in five years.</p> <p>Mourinho will attempt to establish a 13-point advantage over Arsenal with victory at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, ensuring Chelsea would claim the championship by winning at Leicester on Wednesday. Wenger, whose side have won their past eight league games, has never beaten a Mourinho team in 12 attempts and has struggled to conceal his contempt for the cagey, if undeniably effective, manner in which his rival\xe2\x80\x99s teams have often played.</p> <p>The Arsenal manager was explaining how his players would be prepared to adapt their approach when he said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s easy to defend. If we have to defend, then we will defend.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet that notion was rejected out of hand by Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not easy, not easy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it was easy you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t lose 3-1 at home to Monaco [in the Champions League]. If he defends well he draws 0-0 against Monaco and wins in Monte Carlo. It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to defend.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho, who confirmed he had never received an apology from Wenger after the Frenchman pushed him in the chest as they clashed on the sidelines in October\xe2\x80\x99s meeting at Stamford Bridge, admitted his team\xe2\x80\x99s approach had changed over recent months to become \xe2\x80\x9cmore strategic, less artistic\xe2\x80\x9d as a result of suspensions and injuries to key players. Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s last two victories, over Queens Park Rangers and Manchester United, were achieved with a combined three shots on target, with the leaders having been forced to adapt to life without their principal forward, Diego Costa. The striker will require a fitness test if he is to feature on Sunday after hamstring trouble, with Didier Drogba and the 17-year-old Dominic Solanke the available forward options.</p> <p>Mourinho offered a context to his team\xe2\x80\x99s recent grind. \xe2\x80\x9cInjuries and suspensions: we lost progressively the balance of our team. We played amazingly well during the most part of the season, scoring a lot of goals and controlling games very well through the quality of our possession. In the last period we are more strategic, less artistic, because from a certain moment Diego injured or suspended; [Nemanja] Matic suspended, injured; [Cesc] F\xc3\xa0bregas injured, suspended; Diego injured again.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you lose crucial pieces, the team loses certain qualities but we are still achieving results. It\xe2\x80\x99s like if you are at sea and your boat sinks, you need something to survive. A raft. In football, team spirit and team ethics, and strategy, is this. We have been top of the league since day one. We are the second team in terms of goals scored. We are the second-best team for goals conceded. The team with fewest defeats. We have some of the most spectacular team goals of the season. So, if we manage to win the league, we did everything right.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho will hand F\xc3\xa0bregas a first appearance as a Chelsea player at the Emirates having confirmed his sales pitch to the midfielder last summer had been the opportunity \xe2\x80\x9cto win titles\xe2\x80\x9d. Chelsea, the Capital One Cup holders, can claim the league with four games to play by winning at Arsenal and Leicester, with the manager adamant they would be worthy champions.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a great achievement for us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLooking at where Chelsea were in the last four or five years, in terms of the Premier League, it would mean a lot. We won the Champions League in the worst Premier League season Chelsea had had in the last decade, so winning the European Cup in that season was completely isolated in context. In the last few years, Chelsea were not even close to winning the title. Last season was the closest it had been for a while. Previously it had been 20 points away, or lost in November.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, also with this situation, a team had ended because Ashley Cole, Frank Lampard, Michael Essien, this generation, almost all finished their career at Chelsea last summer. If we can be champions after that successful team and with people without a history of winning lots of titles \xe2\x80\x93 young people and new people in the club \xe2\x80\x93 that would be a great achievement. Arsenal, United and City can be champions mathematically, but we have been the best team since day one, and we want to be the best team until the last day.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
