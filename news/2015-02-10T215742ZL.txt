b'<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s that! The whistle blows on a superlative match. Whether Tottenham deserved to lose is a moot point - they contributed so much to the occasion - but Liverpool won, playing very well themselves. And it was Mario Balotelli - who else? - who decided a madcap evening. Marvellous entertainment, and Liverpool have hauled themselves back into the race for fourth. Balotelli, after such a frustrating start to his Liverpool career, could be forgiven for skittering all round Anfield to celebrate such an important goal, but opts to wander off calmly, like a man popping out to the shops for 20 Bensons and a pint of milk.
