Clarke, who plays for Notts County, added a third seven minutes from time after Finland failed to clear Alex Scott\xe2\x80\x99s cross. Gemma Bonner was shown a red card in the final minutes after bringing down Annika Kukkonen when she was through on goal. Finland\xe2\x80\x99s captain, Maija Saari, converted the spot-kick in the final minute of the game, but it was no more than a consolation.</p>'
