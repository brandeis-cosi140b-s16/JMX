b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho: PSG are most aggressive team Chelsea have faced this season'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has labelled Paris Saint-Germain as the \xe2\x80\x9cmost aggressive\xe2\x80\x9d side his Chelsea team has faced this season ahead of the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday.</p> <p>PSG travel to London looking to avenge their defeat in the quarter-finals of the same competition last season. The tie is delicately poised after a 1-1 draw in the first leg but after Eden Hazard was fouled nine times at the Parc des Princes, Mourinho admitted he is hoping the officials give his players more protection this time.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was surprised in that game. I was surprised,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBecause a team with fantastic players was the team with a record number of fouls, was the team making foul after foul, was the team which stopped Hazard with fouls all the time, was the team attacking the man in possession of the ball with two or three players with some very aggressive actions, a team where \xe2\x80\x93 even a player like Zlatan [Ibrahimovic], a typical attacking player \xe2\x80\x93 came back when they lost the ball and attacked Hazard from behind when we were countering.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI thought an English team would never be surprised by aggression, because aggression we have in our country. This season we\xe2\x80\x99ve played against sides from the Championship in the cups, against teams from League One, and Shrewsbury from League Two, but the most aggressive team was PSG. For me, that was a real surprise. With players of such quality, I was expecting more football and less aggression.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
