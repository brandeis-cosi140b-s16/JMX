b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho says Chelsea suffered in silence in narrow win against QPR'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s frustration at what he perceives to be a lack of atmosphere generated by home fans at Stamford Bridge has prompted the Chelsea manager to suggest his side gains \xe2\x80\x9cless support\xe2\x80\x9d there than at rival grounds.</p> <p>The Portuguese emerged from Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s west London derby success against Queens Park Rangers, witnessed by 41,486 spectators, to claim it had been \xe2\x80\x9clike playing in an empty stadium\xe2\x80\x9d with the mood around the arena having apparently affected his players. Mourinho aired similar criticisms last season in a bid to provoke a reaction, though he could offer no explanation as to why the atmosphere felt flat.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s getting worse,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Chelsea manager. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen comparing to my previous time at the club, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s getting worse. I don\xe2\x80\x99t question the passion and the love. I\xe2\x80\x99m nobody to question that, and I know clearly that\xe2\x80\x99s not true. Chelsea fans show us their passion for this club every day, but there is a certain \xe2\x80\x98line of living\xe2\x80\x99 [way of behaving] at matches at Stamford Bridge. I can clearly say we are the team to get less support in home matches.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>A number of potential explanations were put to Mourinho, from high ticket prices to whether the number of corporate fans in the ground had affected the atmosphere, and even if a level of complacency had set in when struggling teams arrive at Stamford Bridge.</p> <p>Yet he could offer no reason for the apparent malaise and his comments, while perhaps serving to deflect from Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s rather sloppy second-half display, provoked extreme reactions \xe2\x80\x93 both in agreement and in disgust \xe2\x80\x93 from the club\xe2\x80\x99s fans on social media over the weekend.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe manager\xe2\x80\x99s criticisms were slightly ill-advised because the fans pay good money to watch highly-paid footballers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tim Rolls of the Chelsea Supporters\xe2\x80\x99 Trust. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the reality is, while I\xe2\x80\x99d rather the ground was a bearpit, that\xe2\x80\x99s not what the Premier League is like these days, with the changed demographic of spectators coming to games, not least because there are an ever increasing number of tourists in the ground. On pricing, it\xe2\x80\x99s around \xc2\xa350 a game, so an awful lot of young people can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to go very often.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a problem across the Premier League. [A lack of] atmosphere issue is not just a Chelsea issue, either: at Old Trafford last week the atmosphere wasn\xe2\x80\x99t what it was, just as it isn\xe2\x80\x99t at Liverpool, either. Home fans are made to sit down, but away fans can stand up. Home fans who do stand up and sing at the Bridge have received letters from the club saying a repetition could mean their season ticket or membership being revoked. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Oscar scored Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s first goal against QPR with a brilliant piece of skill.

Certainly, QPR\xe2\x80\x99s travelling support were raucous in celebrating Charlie Austin\xe2\x80\x99s cleverly taken equaliser, a back-heeled goal, which was a reward for the team\xe2\x80\x99s new-found resilience away from home and the inroads they made on the break after the interval. Yet Eden Hazard\xe2\x80\x99s penalty, awarded for Eduardo Vargas\xe2\x80\x99s clumsy contact, maintained the leaders\xe2\x80\x99 four-point advantage at the top.</p> <p>Mourinho acknowledged the sloppiness of his players\xe2\x80\x99 display, making his dissatisfaction clear at half-time. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was not happy and told us we hadn\xe2\x80\x99t played well and had to do better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Willian.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was dangerous for us, to be only 1-0 up. So we had to improve. He was right because even then QPR came on to the pitch for the second half and scored their goal to get level. But at least we reacted. We had to. We had to run more, keep the ball better, get at them more. Hazard ended up making that great dribble and winning the penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The hosts\xe2\x80\x99 lead had been established by their most impressive performer, the revived Oscar, whose toils from the early part of this year feel increasingly distant.</p> <p>His wonderful opening goal, dispatched with the outside of his right foot, illuminated the occasion even if Mourinho, perhaps conscious of complacency creeping in, on and off the pitch after an unbeaten start to the campaign, felt compelled to deliver his criticisms post-match to ensure everyone, from players to fans, remains on their toes.</p> <p>Man of the match Oscar (Chelsea)</p>'
