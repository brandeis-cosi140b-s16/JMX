b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho keen to set about Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s title defence straight away'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho will allow himself five minutes to celebrate the Premier League title when it is won before turning his attentions to the task of retaining the trophy next term.</p> <p>Chelsea, who start the weekend 13 points clear at the top, can claim their first league championship in five years by defeating Crystal Palace on Sunday. It will be Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s eighth league title from his time at Porto, Internazionale, Real Madrid and in two spells at the London club and the manager will have a replica trophy made to commemorate the achievement to add to his personal collection.</p> <p>The real silverware will not be presented to the league winners until after their final home game, against Sunderland on 24 May, though Mourinho is unperturbed at the prospect of waiting a further three weeks even if the title is secured this weekend. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care, really,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe meaning is the important thing: the feeling, the emotion \xe2\x80\xa6 that\xe2\x80\x99s what stays with you forever.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI have replicas of every cup I won, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t care about the replicas. Or the medals. They\xe2\x80\x99re in my houses. I have some in Portugal, some here, some in my son\xe2\x80\x99s room. I really don\xe2\x80\x99t care. What stays forever is the feeling, the emotion, the memory of the moment. I have clear in my head every one of these moments I lived. What motivated me are the basic things in football, like when you are a kid you play in the street with your neighbours, three against three, four against four, and you want to win. That\xe2\x80\x99s the most pure feeling in football.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are in a championship, you want to win it. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t depend on the level you are. To be champions in the Premier League is not a different feeling to winning the championship in League One, League Two or the Conference. The happiness, also the frustrations \xe2\x80\xa6 in terms of human feelings, they\xe2\x80\x99re exactly the same.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut the moment itself, it only lasts for a flash. For that moment a final finishes, or the game that gives you the league ends, you have like a flash of the people you love most, the people who are with you, a little bit of the most important moments that lead to that trophy. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a quick flash. And, with me, five minutes later, I move on. I have to think about next season, to prepare. We need to think about that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea have led the division \xe2\x80\x93 barring Tottenham Hotspur topping the table on goal difference for the second full week of the campaign \xe2\x80\x93 all season, re-establishing their advantage in the new year after Manchester City had threatened to haul them in. Mourinho, who will welcome back Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my against Palace but will not risk Diego Costa, has relished the fact that the pressure has always been on the chasing pack.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI prefer that because it depends only on you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen people sometimes say: \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s yours to lose, so you\xe2\x80\x99re under pressure\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 we are not under pressure. The pressure is on the teams who have to win and wait for us to lose. It happened a bit to us last season. We were winning and winning but we had to wait for the others to drop points. This season, basically since March, when we recovered the distance we\xe2\x80\x99d lost in December, the problem was for the others to deal with. They had to win.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSome of them had fantastic runs. Manchester United had I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many victories consecutively [six], Arsenal too [eight], but they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t close the gap. This is the real pressure. For us, it was just about us. Nothing else matters. Just us. This weekend we don\xe2\x80\x99t care about Hull City against Arsenal, or United against West Bromwich Albion. It\xe2\x80\x99s just about us. This is the feeling I like. Not to be depending on the others.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m never nervous, to be fair. When it goes to the countdown, I like the feeling that we have to force it. We can\xe2\x80\x99t wait for it. I like the feeling of the last month: come on, let\xe2\x80\x99s go, we need four victories, three victories, two. Now we need one. I like this feeling of being almost there but not there. I like this last push.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
