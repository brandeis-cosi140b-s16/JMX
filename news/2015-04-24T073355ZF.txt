b'Football transfer rumours: Wesley Sneijder to Manchester United?'


b'<p>Tottenham Hotspur are drawing up plans for the stadium they are to move into by the start of the 2018-2019 season and word is that architects have been instructed to ensure it projects the club\xe2\x80\x99s identity. It must look impressive at first but then betray vulnerabilities and ultimately turn out to be convincingly outside the top four structures in the Premier League. Arf! Only joshing, Spurs fans: the truth is, according to the Daily Mail at any rate, that Tottenham chiefs want their new home to be so salubrious the NFL franchise expected to be set up in the capital soon will want to share it. Which raises the question as to what would be a suitable name for such a gridiron outfit: how about the London Kings, which alludes both to England\xe2\x80\x99s royal heritage and the hugely popular Ledley? Or, perhaps the North London Cocks?</p> <p>The stadium is also expected to feature a retractable pitch so the football team can roll in their surface and have one suitable for American Football underneath, all of which would surely appeal to chairman Daniel Levy, who would thus have the option of changing to a completely different sport whenever the whim takes him, including to one in which sackers are greatly prized.</p> <p>On the player front, Tottenham are being linked with Florian Thauvin, the 22-year-old who joined Marseille amid much fanfare and controversy following his starring role in France\xe2\x80\x99s victory at the Under-20 World Cup a couple of years ago, but has now lost some of his sheen. Marseille are believed to be willing to listen to offers for the player and Spurs and Internazionale, who have expressed their interest, are said to be salivating at the prospect of landing a gifted young talent with possible potential-filling issues.</p> <p>Marseille may also be prepared to relinquish 22-year-old midfield dynamo Giannelli Imbula, but only for a colossal fee. Chelsea and Juventus will begin the bidding at \xc2\xa325m. Liverpool are also sniffing around Marseille and can smell a couple of bargains, with winger Andr\xc3\xa9 Ayew and right-back Rod Fanni out of contract at the V\xc3\xa9lodrome this summer. Did someone say bargain? Mike Ashley has got Newcastle on Ayew\xe2\x80\x99s case too.</p> <p>But if Ayew and Fanni do move to Anfield, who will be their manager? Brendan Rodgers says he is the best man for Liverpool but he once said something similar about Iago Aspas and Fabio Borini so it is not too difficult to imagine a world in which he is embarrassingly wide of the mark. And the spectre of Rafael Ben\xc3\xadtez continues to loom large on the horizon, especially as it looks as if Sinisa Mihajlovic has agreed to leave Sampdoria to manage Napoli next season, leaving the Spaniard at a loose end. Not that Ben\xc3\xadtez will be short of offers, especially as L\xe2\x80\x99Equipe are claiming Paris Saint-Germain are toying with the idea of getting him to replace Laurent Blanc, though Antonio Conte is also under consideration.</p> <p>L\xe2\x80\x99Equipe makes no mention of PSG plotting a summer swoop for Jake Livermore, which will be a mighty relief to Tim Sherwood, who plans to bring the former Tottenham midfielder to Aston Villa if Hull go down.</p> <p>Wesley Sneijder is threatening to become a sort of one-man Abba tribute act, with the Dutch tease proving as enduring a presence in the transfer pages as the Swedish pop combo\xe2\x80\x99s Greatest Hits are in the album charts. Today the Money, Money, Money singer is being linked with Manchester United, again. And so is the 21-year-old PSV winger Memphis Depay.</p> <p>Javier Hern\xc3\xa1ndez\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League goal for Real Madrid in midweek has not changed United\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of him, except perhaps to add a couple of million to his transfer fee, which is bad news for West Ham, who are hoping to pick the Mexican up for a song. But not Alex Song, hopefully, as West Ham want to sign him on a permanent basis from Barcelona. But so do many other clubs, including Liverpool and Everton.</p> <p>Internazionale are offering to collect some of Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s surplus staff and recycle them in Italy, starting with Stevan Jovetic. Inter are even said to be chasing Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9, regularly stopping to tie their laces or buy ice cream lest they overtake him.</p>'
