b'The Fiver | Busy with the mannequins'


b'BRIDGE OF SIGHS <p>So here we are again, again. Chelsea versus Liverpool in the semi-final of a cup. For some time now, this has been a nightmare from which The Fiver has been trying to wake. And, like everything else The Fiver tries, it is failing worse than a bodybuilder trying to count how many days there are in the week. Or worse than the best man who stumbled bringing up the rings and knocked the priest and the bride into the water feature behind them. Or worse than Harrison Ford at the Oscars. Fail. Fail. Fail. Fail. Fail. Fail. Fail. Tonight\xe2\x80\x99s fixture will be no different.</p> <p>Not that The Fiver did not try. Once it had gotten out of bed at 12.51pm \xe2\x80\xa6 OK, OK, 2.51pm \xe2\x80\xa6 brushed its teeth with chocolate milk and mouth-washed with soda, it picked up the phone and put in the calls seeing who was up for pool and hot dogs at the Emporium. First up was Weird Uncle Fiver, but he was busy with the mannequins. Next was Hipster Fiver, but he was cycling his velocipede to an abandoned warehouse in Clapton, where he and his mates were going to watch compilations of Judy Funnie\xe2\x80\x99s best bits and then paint their favourite scenes on eggs before hanging them \xe2\x80\x93 ironically, of course \xe2\x80\x93 from the walls of Brick Lane. Last up was $exually Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver, but he was doing something $exually repressed with Morris dancing and the Fiver gave that up weeks ago. Sigh.</p> <p>So to the match then, 1-1 after last week\xe2\x80\x99s first leg. Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho is approaching it all with his usual, serene, calm, mild-mannered approach. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a knockout game, a second leg of a semi-final, live or die,\xe2\x80\x9d he said before pr1cking his finger and writing his team out in blood. With his mouth buttoned down and index digit wrapped up, he continued: \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe the fact we play against a good team will push us on to a different level of concentration and motivation that, against Bradford, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t reach.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Brendan Rodgers is usually the type of boss who is a chilled out entertainer that likes having a laugh, but that Bradford defeat has him worried. \xe2\x80\x9cChelsea\xe2\x80\x99s result at the weekend does not help us,\xe2\x80\x9d he philosophised, looking at the camera just a little too long for it to be comfortable. \xe2\x80\x9cThey will have great motivation and after a game like that you want to put it right, but it will be on their mind. Having been 2-0 up and lost, they will know they can still lose Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s game whatever the score is.\xe2\x80\x9d (Of course, if Chelsea are 1,251-0 up, they\xe2\x80\x99ll know that there is absolutely no way they can lose the game, Brendan did not add.)</p> <p>So here we are again. Another Tuesday night. Another lonely Tuesday night. Another lonely Tuesday night watching Chelsea versus Liverpool. One day The Fiver will awake from this nightmare, Harry\xe2\x80\x99s talents with those statuettes will be recognised, the best man will be forgiven and they\xe2\x80\x99ll realise the answer is six. Or is it seven? Oh no.
