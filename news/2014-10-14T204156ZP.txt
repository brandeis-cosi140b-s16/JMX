b'Poland v Scotland: Euro 2016 qualifier \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened | Scott Murray'


b'<p>A bit of keep-ball by Scotland, and the visitors see it out for a draw! The hosts look thoroughly disappointed, a bit of a let-down after the joys of Saturday against Germany, and they will feel they should have snatched the win in the end. But Scotland were brilliant for large portions of that game, and defeat would have been cruel. A fair result on balance, and Scotland will be very pleased with their four-point haul from this international break! Oidhche mhath, everyone!</p>'
