b'<p>The Fifa presidential candidate J\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xb4me Champagne has proposed that the biggest leagues in football should help to fund developing leagues around the world. Speaking to the website The Set Pieces, Champagne cited the English Premier League as an example of a league that could lead the redistribution of funds.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI follow the Premier League, but at the same time I would like them to give something back. They make $40m from Indian TV rights, so why not hand back a little chunk to the Indian league? That\xe2\x80\x99s about solidarity, that\xe2\x80\x99s about justice, that\xe2\x80\x99s about fairness.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI know that there are a lot of people [in England] who feel this responsibility. We cannot only wish to sell jerseys abroad. We take and then we give. One day there will be Indian players playing in the Premier League.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He added: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is because we have invested in African football, that we have so many good African players. I think many parents around the world would be happy if their kids would support a local club and a foreign club. I never said that it would be easy, but the reality is that if we don\xe2\x80\x99t do it in a generous way, it will be imposed. So let\xe2\x80\x99s be open minded, let\xe2\x80\x99s be generous.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     The Indian Super League proved a big hit in cities such as Mumbai.

In a country like India, the Premier League is in a good position to lead. I would have no problem with putting that money under the authority and leadership of the Premier League. They know the market.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAt the same time, we have to do in a way where we\xe2\x80\x99re not just trying to sell Chelsea jerseys. We need transparency, joint decisions. We can create that system. What I want to avoid is what we have now: we send delegations, we do nice reports and then nothing happens. I think there are enough generous, intelligent people in the Premier League who understand that the growth of local football in places like India would be good for the growth of the Premier League in India. It\xe2\x80\x99s a game where everyone can benefit.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Champagne also pledged to fight for limitations on overseas players to preserve the \xe2\x80\x9cidentity\xe2\x80\x9d of national teams and called for reconciliation between Fifa and the English FA.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI want to tell the English people to join the change instead of sitting and brooding on your side of the Channel. Because we need you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
