b'Football transfer rumours: Bale and Busquets to Manchester United?'


b'<p>Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry everyone! Are you excited? The Mill is extremely excited. It\xe2\x80\x99s nearly here! It\xe2\x80\x99s nearly here! All those smiling faces, the food, the friends, the laughter, the songs. Children running round fuelled by nothing but the pure joy in their little hearts. Grown-ups beaming from ear to ear with merriment. Yep, there\xe2\x80\x99s only 10 more sleeps \xe2\x80\x93 10 more sleeps \xe2\x80\x93 until the opening of the January transfer window!</p> <p>And what a January transfer window it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be. Manchester United will be very busy, um, planning for a summer spending spree that according to the weekend tabloids will include a club record offer for Real Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s Gareth Bale, who is ready to skip back to Britain after a couple of years in Spain.</p> <p>Joining Bale in United\xe2\x80\x99s 2015-16 lineup will be Sergio Busquets, who is \xe2\x80\x9ckeeping his options open\xe2\x80\x9d at Barcelona, Mill regulars F\xc3\xa1bio Coentr\xc3\xa3o, Roma\xe2\x80\x99s Kevin Strootman and Borussia Dortmund\xe2\x80\x99s Mats Hummels, who is pretty unimpressed with his side\xe2\x80\x99s Bundesliga efforts this weekend. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s pretty astonishing that we are so pathetic,\xe2\x80\x9d he said after the 2-1 defeat to Werder Bremen.</p> <p>Manchester City, on the other hand, will be forking out in an attempt to reinforce their title hopes. And the man Manuel Pellegrini wants most of all is \xe2\x80\xa6 former Chelsea flop Kevin De Bruyne. They\xe2\x80\x99ll have to offer Wolfsburg \xc2\xa320m in order to tempt the Belgium player away. Wesley Sneijder, though, won\xe2\x80\x99t be heading to Eastlands \xe2\x80\x93 Galatasaray are putting their foot down and won\xe2\x80\x99t let him leave next month.</p> <p>The Lyon midfielder and Father Ted swearword Nabil Fekir is a target for Arsenal and the player\xe2\x80\x99s dad says he\xe2\x80\x99ll choose the Gunners over Manchester City if push comes to shove. An offer in the region of \xc2\xa38m might be enough to get the 21-year-old to the Emirates. Tomas Rosicky, meanwhile, could be on his way out of the door in north London, with Olympiakos ready to pounce.</p> <p>Chelsea want to add to the growing list of Brazilians-with-names-like-chaps-from-the-1950s plying their trade in Europe with a swoop for the 17-year-old Corinthians forward Malcom. Barcelona, though, apparently have first dibs.</p> <p>Neil Warnock wants Lille\xe2\x80\x99s Pape Souar\xc3\xa9 at Selhurst Park, though the Mill wonders if the Crystal Palace manager actually said he wanted \xe2\x80\x9ca little soiree at Selhurst Park\xe2\x80\x9d and was misheard by a well-meaning club suit. If that\xe2\x80\x99s the case he\xe2\x80\x99ll be somewhat taken aback when he gets the \xc2\xa33m bill.</p> <p>Jay Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s latest injury setback means that Mauricio Pochettino will look to bring Saido Berahino to Tottenham next month rather than his former Southampton charge. And Spurs want Aston Villa\xe2\x80\x99s Aly Cissokho too.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 That\xe2\x80\x99s it from the Mill for Christmas. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be back with more tittle-tattle from 30 December.</p>'
