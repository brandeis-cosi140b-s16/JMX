b'<p>IT HAS 16 BALLS AND STILL MAKES OLD MEN SWEAT</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible to forecast which teams will meet in the final at Berlin\xe2\x80\x99s Oympiastadion on 6 June 2015, but we can definitely expect more of the same,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gianni Infantino. By more of the same, Uefa\xe2\x80\x99s favourite general secretary was referring to \xe2\x80\x9ca wealth of fantastic matches, memorable goals and brilliant individual displays\xe2\x80\x9d. Luckily, with everyone\xe2\x80\x99s favourite egg-headed football administrator and Big Cup bingo caller at the helm, the draw to decide who\xe2\x80\x99d be playing who was also heartwarmingly familiar.</p> <p>Sixteen plastic footballs containing the names of the 16 remaining teams printed on rectangular bits of paper? Tick. A load of giant upturned contact lenses from which to pluck said balls once they\xe2\x80\x99d been given a good fondling? Tick. Uefa director of competitions Giorgio Marchetti apologetically explaining the rules to a roomful of bored middle-aged suits who just wanted him to crack on with it so they could get to lunch? Tick. A semi-presentable former professional footballer to act as Debbie McGee to Gianni\xe2\x80\x99s Paul Daniels? Tick.</p> <p>Former Germany and Borussia Dortmund striker Karl-Heinz Riedle was the Big Cup winner tasked with cracking lame (even by the Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s standards) gags about how difficult it was to unscrew the footballs into individual halves to reveal the rectangular bits of paper, but despite the stress his job entailed, he managed to elicit his first half-hearted \xe2\x80\x9cooh\xe2\x80\x9d of the day at the first time of asking, teeing up a last-16 tie between PSG and Chelsea. Buoyed by his early success, the German quickly \xe2\x80\x93 well, as quickly as his combination of sausage and banana fingers would allow \xe2\x80\x93 prompted some barely audible muttering by pitting Manchester City against Barcelona.</p> <p>On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on [that\xe2\x80\x99s enough padding \xe2\x80\x93 Fiver Ed.] it went, with the camera cutting to the pertinent club representative in the audience as each team was drawn. To a man they remained inscrutable, or possibly asleep, although if the Fiver was a betting email we\xe2\x80\x99d wager the reaction of Arsenal club secretary David Miles upon seeing his club given the easiest draw available against Monaco was something along the lines of: \xe2\x80\x9cIt shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t work, but South African lobster tail with Cristal sauce and black truffles is too tempting to pass up.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>With Basel/Basle/Baarrrrrlll v Porto, Shakhtar Donetsk, v Bayern Munich, Schalke v Real Madrid, Juventus v Borussia Dortmund and Bayer Leverkusen and Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid making up the numbers, we can now look forward to an exciting round of closely-fought fixtures featuring Europe\xe2\x80\x99s elite beginning in February. And if last year\xe2\x80\x99s were anything to go by we\xe2\x80\x99re unlikely to be disappointed. In last season\xe2\x80\x99s round of 16, as many as one tie out of eight remained in the balance at the end of the first leg, before Manchester United eventually beat Olympiakos to join the seven other group-stage winners in the quarter-finals. It might, as Gianni suggests, be \xe2\x80\x9cimpossible to forecast which teams will meet in the final at Berlin\xe2\x80\x99s Oympiastadion on 6 June 2015\xe2\x80\x9d, but predicting which ones will get to the last eight is unlikely to be too tough.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>John Ashdown is in the hot seat for Everton 2-1 QPR from 8pm GMT.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>16 February 2012: \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t do walking away\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Pope\xe2\x80\x99s Newc O\xe2\x80\x99Rangers manager Ally McCoist makes his stance clear.</p> <p>15 December 2014: \xe2\x80\x9cThe company announces that Alastair McCoist, manager of the first-team squad, has resigned\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 ah.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf the Fiver really does have a satirical microscope (Friday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver), you might want to get it looked at as it may be broken\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Kevin Denham.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cCan I be the first of 1,057 possibly-soon-to-be-homeless people to have spotted James Tong\xe2\x80\x99s name in the Football365 Mailbox this morning and bet their house on him sending the same joke to the Fiver this afternoon? I say this as someone who was immediately before him on the other site, and has also emailed the Fiver, albeit with a different unfunny observation\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ed Taylor [he did \xe2\x80\x93 Fiver Ed].</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
