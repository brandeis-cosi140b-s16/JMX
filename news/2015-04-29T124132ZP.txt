b'Premier League finances: the full club-by-club breakdown and verdict'


b'<p>Financial figures for 2013-14, for the 20 clubs in the Premier League during 2013-14. All details from the published annual reports at Companies House. Net debt is as stated in the accounts; debts minus cash held at the bank. The separate categories of turnover are each rounded down or up, so added together they do not always tally with the total turnover figure. </p> ARSENAL <p>Accounts for the year to 31 May 2014</p>       <p>Ownership Arsenal Holdings PLC major shareholders are: Kroenke Sports Enterprises UK (registered in Delaware, owned by US resident Stan Kroenke) 67%. Red and White Securities Limited (owned via Jersey, by Russian resident Alisher Usmanov and Farhad Moshiri) 30%</p> <p>Turnover 4th highest in league, \xc2\xa3304m (up from \xc2\xa3283m in 2013)</p> <p>Gate and matchday income \xc2\xa3100m</p> <p>TV and broadcasting \xc2\xa3121m</p> <p>Retail \xc2\xa318m</p> <p>Commercial \xc2\xa359m</p> <p>Property development \xc2\xa33m</p> <p>Player trading \xc2\xa30.5m</p> <p>Wage bill 4th highest, \xc2\xa3166m (up from \xc2\xa3154m)</p> <p>Wages as proportion of turnover 55%</p> <p>Profit before tax \xc2\xa35m (down from \xc2\xa37m)</p> <p>Net debt \xc2\xa333m</p> <p>Interest payable \xc2\xa314m</p> <p>Highest-paid director Ivan Gazidis \xc2\xa32.191m</p> <p>State they\xe2\x80\x99re in</p> <p>Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s modern struggle has been to translate copious earnings from high-paying supporters at the Emirates Stadium into football success, and they are making progress. In 2013-4 they salvaged a summer of grumbles by splashing \xc2\xa342.5m for Mesut \xc3\x96zil, a club record-breaking signing included in these figures.</p> <p>They show scope for further spending; a huge \xc2\xa354m was put in the bank where Arsenal had \xc2\xa3208m on deposit. Hence they bought again last summer, with \xc2\xa330m Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez the stand-out move. Debt from building the Emirates remained \xc2\xa3240m but Arsenal, as always planned, are managing it comfortably.</p> ASTON VILLA <p>Accounts for the year to 31 May 2014</p>       <p>Ownership Owned by Randy Lerner, via Reform Acquisitions LLC, a US company.</p> <p>Turnover 9th highest, \xc2\xa3117m (up from \xc2\xa384m in 2013)</p> <p>Gate and matchday \xc2\xa313m</p> <p>TV and broadcasting \xc2\xa373m</p> <p>Commercial \xc2\xa322m</p> <p>Sponsorship \xc2\xa39m</p> <p>Wage bill Joint 9th highest, \xc2\xa369m (down from \xc2\xa372m)</p> <p>Wages as proportion of turnover 59%</p> <p>Loss before tax \xc2\xa34m (following \xc2\xa352m loss in 2013)</p> <p>Net debt \xc2\xa3102m</p> <p>Interest payable \xc2\xa31m</p> <p>Highest-paid director \xc2\xa3265,792 to unnamed director (Paul Faulkner was the chief executive throughout the year; he resigned in July 2014.)</p> <p>State they\xe2\x80\x99re in</p> <p>This was the season American MBNA credit-card scion Randy Lerner finally announced his Villa venture was over and he wanted to sell. Villa\xe2\x80\x99s finances, despite a miserable season under a downbeat Paul Lambert, show the club being moulded into a state fit for sale.</p> <p>The wage bill barely increased despite a \xc2\xa333m increase in income, and Villa stated they spent nothing, net, on transfers last summer. Lerner wrote off \xc2\xa390m loans, leaving \xc2\xa386m still owed to him. Perhaps the new TV deals, and Tim Sherwood\xe2\x80\x99s Tiggerish bounce, will attract a buyer.</p> CARDIFF CITY <p>Accounts for the year to 31 May 2014</p>     Cardiff City graphic   <p>Ownership Club states that Vincent Tan is the 87.5% owner</p> <p>Turnover 20th highest, \xc2\xa383m (up from \xc2\xa317m in 2013)</p> <p>Gate receipts &amp; matchday \xc2\xa38m</p> <p>Premier League including TV \xc2\xa364m</p> <p>Sponsorship &amp; commercial \xc2\xa311m</p> <p>Wage bill 18th highest, \xc2\xa353m (up from \xc2\xa333m in 2013)</p> <p>Wages as proportion of turnover 64%</p> <p>Loss before tax \xc2\xa312m (down from \xc2\xa330m loss in 2013)</p> <p>Net debt not stated; \xc2\xa3130m loans from overseas shareholders</p> <p>Interest payable \xc2\xa31.6m</p> <p>Highest-paid director Not stated</p> <p>State they\xe2\x80\x99re in</p> <p>A single Premier League season remembered for owner Vincent Tan insistently wearing the club shirt he changed to red, Malky Mackay\xe2\x80\x99s sacking in December 2013 and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\xe2\x80\x99s forlorn fading smile as the Bluebirds fell to relegation.</p> <p>Figures illustrate the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s breakaway land of plenty \xe2\x80\x93 City received almost \xc2\xa360m more TV money than the \xc2\xa35m made in the Championship in 2012-13. That reduced the dramatic loss incurred to win promotion but Tan still increased his loans by \xc2\xa364.5m to \xc2\xa3130m. Relegation, despite lucrative parachute payments, will have hurt.</p> CHELSEA <p>Accounts (of the holding company, Fordstam) for the year to 30 June 2014</p>       <p>Ownership Wholly owned by Roman Abramovich, registered at Companies House as a Russian resident.</p> <p>Turnover 3rd highest, \xc2\xa3324m (up from \xc2\xa3260m in 2013)</p> <p>Broadcasting \xc2\xa3140m</p> <p>Matchday \xc2\xa371m</p> <p>Commercial \xc2\xa3114m</p> <p>Wage bill 3rd highest, \xc2\xa3192m (up from \xc2\xa3179m in 2013)</p> <p>Wages as proportion of turnover 59%</p> <p>Profit before tax \xc2\xa315m (following \xc2\xa357m loss in 2013)</p> <p>Net debt \xc2\xa31bn</p> <p>Interest payable \xc2\xa3Nil</p> <p>Highest-paid director Unnamed, \xc2\xa31.425m (Ron Gourlay was the chief executive throughout the year; resigned October 2014)</p> <p>State they\xe2\x80\x99re in</p> <p>Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s former chief executive for the Roman Abramovich project, Peter Kenyon, famously promised the oligarch\xe2\x80\x99s splurge would stop and the club would break even by 2010. Here, four years later, they finally did it, turning a massive loss in 2013 into a profit, buoyed by an extra \xc2\xa334m from the new TV deal, a \xc2\xa330m increase in commercial sponsorships, and restraining the rise in wages to \xc2\xa313m.</p> <p>Abramovich nevertheless increased his loans by a further \xc2\xa357m, lifting his total funding of Chelsea to a historically astonishing \xc2\xa31.041bn. Chelsea then bought big and well.</p> CRYSTAL PALACE <p>Accounts of CPFC 2010 Ltd for the year to 30 June 2014</p>       <p>Ownership Owned equally by Steve Parish, Stephen Browett, Martin Long and Jeremy Hosking.</p> <p>Turnover 17th highest, \xc2\xa390m (up from \xc2\xa315m in 2013)</p> <p>Broadcasting \xc2\xa374m</p> <p>Matchday \xc2\xa39m</p> <p>Commercial and other \xc2\xa37m</p> <p>Wage bill 19th highest, \xc2\xa346m (up from \xc2\xa319m in 2013)</p> <p>Wages as proportion of turnover 51%</p> <p>Profit before tax \xc2\xa323m (up from \xc2\xa32m in 2013)</p> <p>Net debt \xc2\xa37m</p> <p>Interest payable \xc2\xa3Nil</p> <p>Highest-paid director No directors were paid</p> <p>State they\xe2\x80\x99re in</p> <p>Another clear case study of the financial chasm between the Championship and the Premier League. Palace\xe2\x80\x99s promotion in 2013, just three years after administration, meant an immediate \xc2\xa366m increase in TV income, delivering a bounteous \xc2\xa323m profit as the wage increase was kept to \xc2\xa327m. Palace stayed up after appointing Tony Pulis and put \xc2\xa324m in the bank. The four fan-owners who originally loaned \xc2\xa33m each to resuscitate Palace - except for Martin Long whose loan is \xc2\xa31.7m - are now in the money, as long as Palace stay in the Premier League.</p> EVERTON <p>Accounts for the year to 31 May 2014</p>       <p>Ownership Shares in the Everton Football Club Company Limited are owned by: Bill Kenwright 25%, Jon Woods 19%, Robert Earl (resident of Florida) 23%</p> <p>Turnover 8th highest, \xc2\xa3121m (up from \xc2\xa386m in 2013)</p> <p>Gate and programme sales \xc2\xa319m</p> <p>TV and broadcasting \xc2\xa388m</p> <p>Sponsorship, advertising and merchandise \xc2\xa38m</p> <p>Catering &amp; other commercial \xc2\xa34m</p> <p>Wage bill Joint 9th highest, \xc2\xa369m (up from \xc2\xa363m in 2013)</p> <p>Wages as proportion of turnover 57%</p> <p>Profit before tax \xc2\xa328m (up from \xc2\xa32m in 2013)</p> <p>Net debt \xc2\xa328m</p> <p>Interest payable \xc2\xa35m</p> <p>Highest-paid director Directors paid for the first time; Highest-paid \xc2\xa3350,000; chief executive Robert Elstone is not a director</p> <p>State they\xe2\x80\x99re in</p> <p>Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez defied the dispiriting predictability that wage spending matches achievement by steering his ninth-highest-paid squad to fifth, two places above Manchester United, for whom David Moyes had left Goodison Park.</p> <p>Everton have for years pushed spending on player signings and wages to the limits of their bank\xe2\x80\x99s tolerance, but used the new TV cash for housekeeping which bordered on the stingy. Turnover increased \xc2\xa335m yet wages increased just \xc2\xa36m. The club would have just broken even but for \xc2\xa328m profit on the sale of players, principally Marouane Fellaini, to Moyes.</p> FULHAM <p>Accounts for the year to 30 June 2014</p>       <p>Ownership Owned by Shahid Khan, via Big Cat Holdings, a company registered in Bermuda (tax haven), and Cougar HoldCo London, registered in the UK.</p> <p>Turnover 16th highest, \xc2\xa391m (up from \xc2\xa373m in 2013)</p> <p>Gate and matchday \xc2\xa312m</p> <p>Premier League including TV \xc2\xa367m</p> <p>Sponsorship and commercial \xc2\xa312m</p> <p>Compensation \xc2\xa30.2m</p> <p>Wage bill Joint 9th highest, \xc2\xa369m (up from \xc2\xa367m in 2013)</p> <p>Wages as proportion of turnover 76%</p> <p>Loss before tax \xc2\xa333m (up from \xc2\xa32m in 2013)</p> <p>Net debt \xc2\xa324m</p> <p>Interest payable \xc2\xa30.3m</p> <p>Highest-paid director Unnamed, \xc2\xa3604,000 (Alastair Mackintosh is the chief executive)</p> <p>State they\xe2\x80\x99re in</p> <p>Not the prettiest financial situation to take into the Championship, a relegation suffered in US buyer Shahid Khan\xe2\x80\x99s first season, following Mohamed Al Fayed\xe2\x80\x99s 16 year, multi-million pound restoration. Fayed criticised manager Felix Magath and Khan, lamenting that his work was \xe2\x80\x9cdestroyed in a season.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Fulham\xe2\x80\x99s wage bill barely increased in 2013-14, yet \xc2\xa321m unspecified \xe2\x80\x9cother external charges\xe2\x80\x9d mostly accounted for the \xc2\xa333m loss. Struggles in the Championship will not have been quite what Khan, who loaned Fulham \xc2\xa326m, foresaw when buying himself a Premier League club less than two years ago.</p> HULL CITY <p>Accounts for the year to 30 June 2014</p>       <p>Ownership Owned by Assem Allam via his company, Allamhouse, registered in the UK</p> <p>Turnover 19th highest, \xc2\xa384m (up from \xc2\xa317m in 2013, including parachute payments)</p> <p>Gate and matchday \xc2\xa312m</p> <p>Premier League including TV \xc2\xa368m</p> <p>Commercial, retail, catering \xc2\xa34m</p> <p>Wage bill 20th highest, \xc2\xa343m (up from \xc2\xa326m in 2013)</p> <p>Wages as proportion of turnover 51%</p> <p>Profit before tax \xc2\xa39m (after \xc2\xa326m loss in 2013)</p> <p>Net debt \xc2\xa365m</p> <p>Interest payable \xc2\xa33m</p> <p>Highest-paid director Assem Allam\xe2\x80\x99s company was paid \xc2\xa3165,000 for his and son Ehab\xe2\x80\x99s services.</p> <p>State they\xe2\x80\x99re in</p> <p>Another promoted club, City\xe2\x80\x99s income instantly increased by \xc2\xa367m, turning the \xc2\xa326m loss incurred to win promotion into a \xc2\xa39m profit. Assem Allam seeks to manage money shrewdly; the club repaid \xc2\xa35.6m of his company loans, which remained \xc2\xa367m, on which he charges 4% interest.</p> <p>City stayed up after Allam sanctioned spending for Steve Bruce, and they reached the FA Cup final. A shame such a landmark achievement was soured by Allam refusing to talk to the local council over a potential stadium expansion and trying to change the club\xe2\x80\x99s name to Hull Tigers, which many fans vehemently oppose.</p> LIVERPOOL <p>Accounts for the year to 31 May 2014</p>       <p>Ownership Fenway Sports Group, registered in the USA, of which John W Henry is the principal shareholder.</p> <p>Turnover 5th highest, \xc2\xa3256m (up from \xc2\xa3206m in 2013)</p> <p>Gate and matchday income \xc2\xa351m</p> <p>TV and broadcasting \xc2\xa3101m</p> <p>Commercial activities \xc2\xa3104m</p> <p>Wage bill 5th highest, \xc2\xa3144m (up from \xc2\xa3132m in 2013)</p> <p>Wages as proportion of turnover 56%</p> <p>Profit before tax \xc2\xa31m (following \xc2\xa350m loss in 2013)</p> <p>Net debt \xc2\xa3126m</p> <p>Interest payable \xc2\xa35m</p> <p>Highest-paid director Unnamed, \xc2\xa31.032m (Ian Ayre is the managing director)</p> <p>State they\xe2\x80\x99re in</p> <p>Still in transition but last season\xe2\x80\x99s agonising second-place finish, the finances and the steel frame of Anfield\xe2\x80\x99s main-stand extension now taking shape, show the direction is progress. John Henry\xe2\x80\x99s FSG did not increase its funding from the \xc2\xa369m interest-free loan already provided, there was \xc2\xa337m boost to TV money and wages increased only \xc2\xa312m. They all restored financial stability.</p> <p>FSG plan for Anfield expansion to accrue cash significant enough to close the gap on higher-earning clubs \xe2\x80\x93 around half the 8,500 extra main-stand seats will be corporate.</p> MANCHESTER CITY <p>Accounts of Manchester City Limited for the year to 31 May 2014</p>       <p>Ownership Wholly owned by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, via the Abu Dhabi United Group, registered in the United Arab Emirates</p> <p>Turnover 2nd highest, \xc2\xa3347m (up from \xc2\xa3271m in 2013)</p> <p>Gate and matchday \xc2\xa347m</p> <p>TV and broadcasting \xc2\xa3133m</p> <p>Commercial activities \xc2\xa3166m</p> <p>Wage bill 2nd highest, \xc2\xa3205m (down from \xc2\xa3233m in 2013)</p> <p>Wages as proportion of turnover 59%</p> <p>Loss before tax \xc2\xa323m (following \xc2\xa352m in 2013)</p> <p>Net debt \xc2\xa346m</p> <p>Interest payable \xc2\xa31m</p> <p>Highest-paid director No directors of Manchester City Limited were paid.</p> <p>State they\xe2\x80\x99re in</p> <p>In sixth year since Sheikh Mansour bought then financially stricken City in August 2008 his total funding reached an extraordinary \xc2\xa31.152bn, including the new \xc2\xa3200m academy.</p> <p>City\xe2\x80\x99s income dramatically increased in a title-winning season and the loss included Uefa\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa316m deduction under financial fair play rules for the previous two years\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa3151m losses. City reduced their wage bill by \xc2\xa328m, mostly due to 125 staff being moved into the accounts of a parent company, City Football Group, which also services Mansour\xe2\x80\x99s New York City, Melbourne City and his minority stake in Yokohama Marinos.</p> MANCHESTER UNITED <p>Accounts for Manchester United Plc, for the year to 30 June 2014</p>       <p>Ownership Owned by the Glazer family via Red Football LLC, a company registered in the low-tax state of Nevada, US, United is now registered in the Cayman Islands tax haven and listed on the New York Stock Exchange.</p> <p>Turnover 1st highest, \xc2\xa3433m (up from \xc2\xa3363m in 2012)</p> <p>Gate and matchday income \xc2\xa3108m</p> <p>TV and broadcasting \xc2\xa3136m</p> <p>Commercial activities \xc2\xa3189m</p> <p>Wage bill 1st highest, \xc2\xa3215m (up from \xc2\xa3181m in 2013)</p> <p>Wages as proportion of turnover 50%</p> <p>Profit before tax \xc2\xa341m (following \xc2\xa39m loss in 2012)</p> <p>Net debt \xc2\xa3275m</p> <p>Interest and finance costs \xc2\xa328m</p> <p>Highest-paid director Not stated</p> <p>State they\xe2\x80\x99re in</p> <p>United still need to manage progress following Sir Alex Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s monumental 27 years but the figures, delivered in a huge document to the New York stock exchange, show the Glazers have effectively won. Nine years after their debt-loading buyout, which has cost United around \xc2\xa3700m in interest and fees, the club still bears \xc2\xa3342m of the Glazers\xe2\x80\x99 borrowings but the income is spectacular.</p> <p>The obsessive sale of sponsorships, TV and huge stadium income made United \xc2\xa3433m, \xc2\xa386m more than the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s next highest-earning club, City, which has support from Abu Dhabi sponsors.</p> NEWCASTLE UNITED <p>Accounts for the year to 30 June 2014</p>       <p>Ownership Mike Ashley owns Newcastle United via his company, MASH Holdings Limited, registered in the UK.</p> <p>Turnover 7th highest, \xc2\xa3130m (up from \xc2\xa396m in 2013)</p> <p>Gate and matchday \xc2\xa326m</p> <p>TV and broadcasting \xc2\xa378m</p> <p>Commercial activities \xc2\xa326m</p> <p>Wage bill 7th highest, \xc2\xa378m (up from \xc2\xa362m in 2013)</p> <p>Wages as proportion of turnover 60%</p> <p>Profit before tax \xc2\xa319m (up from \xc2\xa310m in 2012)</p> <p>Net debt \xc2\xa395m</p> <p>Interest payable \xc2\xa30.19m</p> <p>Highest-paid director Unnamed, \xc2\xa3106,793 (Lee Charnley was the managing director)</p> <p>State they\xe2\x80\x99re in</p> <p>There are two ways of looking at Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s financial picture. Mike Ashley would say it is incomparably healthier than the over-borrowed operation he took over in 2007; money was spent on wages, he has \xc2\xa3129m loans interest-free which he did not reduce. Protesting fans see the \xc2\xa319m profit, \xc2\xa339m banked, and ubiquitous free Sports Direct advertising as evidence that Ashley sees the club as a cash cow.</p> <p>Newcastle maintain this is unfair and have promised to invest this summer \xe2\x80\x93 as well as appoint a manager. The figures show the money is there.</p> NORWICH CITY <p>Accounts for year months to 30 June 2014 (Comparative figures for 2012-13 were for a 13-month period)</p>       <p>Ownership Majority owned, 53.1%, by Delia Smith and her husband Michael Wynn Jones</p> <p>Turnover 15th highest, \xc2\xa394m (up from \xc2\xa375m in 2013)</p> <p>Gate receipts \xc2\xa311m</p> <p>Premier League including TV \xc2\xa368m</p> <p>Catering \xc2\xa34m</p> <p>Commercial and other income \xc2\xa310m</p> <p>Wage bill 17th highest, \xc2\xa354m (up from \xc2\xa351m in 2013)</p> <p>Wages as proportion of turnover 57%</p> <p>Profit before tax \xc2\xa39m (up from \xc2\xa31m profit in 2013)</p> <p>Net debt Nil; \xc2\xa33m net cash in the bank</p> <p>Interest payable \xc2\xa30.35m</p> <p>Highest-paid director \xc2\xa31.19m paid to unnamed director (David McNally is the chief executive)</p> <p>State they\xe2\x80\x99re in</p> <p>If finances were the measure of success, here is the very picture of a flourishing club - wages at 57% of \xc2\xa3100m income, \xc2\xa39m profit made. But they are not, and Norwich went down. This season will have been financially more difficult but Norwich are well run these days; they have no debt and players\xe2\x80\x99 wages are significantly linked to performance.</p> <p>Of the three relegated clubs, Norwich have adjusted best to the Championship and, Alex Neil having replaced Neil Adams as manager in January, are challenging for a bounce-back promotion.</p> SOUTHAMPTON <p>Accounts of St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s Football Group Limited for the year to 30 June 2014</p>       <p>Ownership Owned by Katharina Liebherr, resident in Switzerland.</p> <p>Turnover 11th highest, \xc2\xa3106m (up from \xc2\xa372m in 2013)</p> <p>Matchday \xc2\xa317m</p> <p>Premier League and broadcasting \xc2\xa379m</p> <p>Commercial activities \xc2\xa38m</p> <p>Other income \xc2\xa31m</p> <p>Wage bill Joint 14th highest, \xc2\xa363m (up from \xc2\xa347m in 2013)</p> <p>Wages as proportion of turnover 59%</p> <p>Profit before tax \xc2\xa329m (after \xc2\xa37m loss in 2013)</p> <p>Net debt \xc2\xa325m</p> <p>Interest payable \xc2\xa32.8m</p> <p>Highest-paid director \xc2\xa31,63m paid to unnamed director - Nicola Cortese was the executive chairman until he resigned on 15 January 2014</p> <p>State they\xe2\x80\x99re in</p> <p>A story of notable over-performance, Saints finished eighth on the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s joint 14th-highest wage bill. Chairman Nicola Cortese\xe2\x80\x99s resignation, apparently contesting a more structured board wanted by owner Katharina Liebherr, did not disrupt the club as some vehemently warned.</p> <p>Saints\xe2\x80\x99 sail through the departure of Mauricio Pochettino and players including Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw and Calum Chambers last summer has been more impressive. The club recruited smartly and Liebherr made \xc2\xa320m loans, taking her total loaned to \xc2\xa334.7m, and she wrote off \xc2\xa338m loans, converting them into shares.</p> STOKE CITY <p>Accounts of Stoke City Football Club Ltd for the year to 31 May 2014</p>       <p>Ownership Owned by bet365 Group, the online gambling company controlled by Denise Coates, daughter of chairman, Peter, and family.</p> <p>Turnover 14th highest, \xc2\xa398m (up from \xc2\xa367m in 2013)</p> <p>Gate receipts \xc2\xa37m</p> <p>Sponsorship and advertising \xc2\xa36m</p> <p>TV and media \xc2\xa376m</p> <p>Conferencing and hospitality \xc2\xa33m</p> <p>Other \xc2\xa31m</p> <p>Retail and merchandising \xc2\xa32m</p> <p>Wage bill 16th highest, \xc2\xa361m (up from \xc2\xa360m in 2013)</p> <p>Wages as proportion of turnover 62%</p> <p>Profit before tax \xc2\xa34m (following \xc2\xa331m loss in 2013)</p> <p>Net debt \xc2\xa338m</p> <p>Interest payable Nil</p> <p>Highest-paid director Unnamed, \xc2\xa3773,000 (Tony Scholes is the chief executive)</p> <p>State they\xe2\x80\x99re in</p> <p>Stoke banked the new TV deal fortunes and used the money to stabilise the club after years of losses incurred maintaining Premier League status. Chairman Peter Coates is a strong supporter of financial fair play, determined the increased TV money would not leak straight through to players, and at Stoke it did not. Despite the \xc2\xa330m increase in income the wage bill barely moved.</p> <p>The Coates family, owners of the bet365 online betting behemoth, did increase their loans to the club by \xc2\xa315m to \xc2\xa357m, but otherwise the books balanced.</p> SUNDERLAND <p>Accounts for the year to 31 July 2014</p>       <p>Ownership Owned by the American Ellis Short via Drumaville, a company registered in Jersey</p> <p>Turnover 12th highest, \xc2\xa3104m (up from \xc2\xa376m in 2013)</p> <p>Gate receipts \xc2\xa316m</p> <p>TV and media \xc2\xa371m</p> <p>Sponsorship and royalties \xc2\xa38m</p> <p>Conference, catering \xc2\xa37m</p> <p>Retail &amp; other commercial \xc2\xa31m</p> <p>Wage bill 8th highest, \xc2\xa370m (up from \xc2\xa358m in 2013)</p> <p>Wages as proportion of turnover 67%</p> <p>Loss before tax \xc2\xa317m (up from \xc2\xa313m in 2013)</p> <p>Net debt \xc2\xa393m</p> <p>Interest payable \xc2\xa32m</p> <p>Highest-paid director Unnamed, \xc2\xa3663,196 (Margaret Byrne is the chief executive)</p> <p>State they\xe2\x80\x99re in</p> <p>Financial stability is proving as stubbornly evasive for Sunderland as managerial consistency. Dick Advocaat, hired to replace Gus Poyet as the club strains to avoid relegation, is the 13th manager, including caretakers, in the 13 years since Peter Reid\xe2\x80\x99s tenure ended in 2002.</p> <p>US owner Ellis Short had \xc2\xa328m loans repaid in 2012-13; last year he put \xc2\xa315.5m back in. Even with the boost to TV income, Sunderland also had a \xc2\xa328m bank loan and a \xc2\xa339m overdraft. Relegation, if Advocaat does not save them, looks like it could be painful.</p> SWANSEA CITY <p>Accounts for the year to 31 May 2014</p>       <p>Ownership Martin Morgan, 23.7%; Brian Katzen, 21.1%; Swansea City Supporters Society Limited (supporters trust) 21.1%; chairman Huw Jenkins 13.2%; Robert Davies 10.5%</p> <p>Turnover 13th highest, \xc2\xa399m (up from \xc2\xa367m in 2013)</p> <p>Match income \xc2\xa39m</p> <p>Media \xc2\xa381m</p> <p>Commercial and other \xc2\xa39m</p> <p>Wage bill Joint 14th highest, \xc2\xa363m (up from \xc2\xa349m in 2013)</p> <p>Wages as proportion of turnover 64%</p> <p>Profit before tax \xc2\xa31m (down from \xc2\xa321m in 2013)</p> <p>Net debt Nil; \xc2\xa32m cash in the bank</p> <p>Interest payable \xc2\xa30.015m</p> <p>Highest-paid director Huw Jenkins, \xc2\xa3550,000</p> <p>State they\xe2\x80\x99re in</p> <p>The Swans\xe2\x80\x99 epic paddle from bottom division and insolvency to Premier League and new stadium owned by a consortium of fan-businessmen, including 20% held by the supporters trust, was committed to documentary with A Jack to a King. Huw Jenkins boldly replaced Michael Laudrup with rookie former player Garry Monk and traded players typically well.</p> <p>The directors, including Jenkins, rewarded themselves and other shareholders with another \xc2\xa31m dividend, following \xc2\xa32m in 2012-13. Jenkins also had a \xc2\xa3300,000 pay rise which included a \xc2\xa3275,000 bonus for maintaining Premier League status.</p> TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR <p>Accounts for the year to 30 June 2014</p>       <p>Ownership Enic International Limited, registered in the Bahamas (tax haven), owns 85% of Spurs. Joe Lewis, resident in the Bahamas, has the controlling 70.6% ownership of Enic; trusts of which chairman Daniel Levy and family are the beneficiaries own the other 29.4%.</p> <p>Turnover 6th highest, \xc2\xa3181m (up from \xc2\xa3147m in 2013)</p> <p>Match receipts \xc2\xa335m</p> <p>TV and media \xc2\xa390m</p> <p>All commercial activities \xc2\xa356m</p> <p>Wage bill 6th highest, \xc2\xa3100m (up from \xc2\xa396m in 2012)</p> <p>Wages as proportion of turnover 55%</p> <p>Profit before tax \xc2\xa380m (up from \xc2\xa34m in 2013)</p> <p>Net debt Nil; \xc2\xa33m in bank</p> <p>Interest payable \xc2\xa37m</p> <p>Highest-paid director \xc2\xa32.17m paid to Daniel Levy</p> <p>State they\xe2\x80\x99re in</p> <p>Spurs\xe2\x80\x99 finances speak of a club making ready to build the long-planned new stadium and two figures leap out. The first is the \xc2\xa380m profit, the largest ever made by an English football club; Spurs say this was effectively the proceeds of selling Gareth Bale to Real Madrid which was then reinvested in new players. Spurs\xe2\x80\x99 TV income was up \xc2\xa332m, they held the wage increase to only \xc2\xa34m, and put \xc2\xa335m in the bank. Such riches rather undermine Spurs\xe2\x80\x99 plea they could not afford \xc2\xa316m agreed for public infrastructure works, which Haringey council waived.</p> <p>The second remarkable figure is chairman Daniel Levy\xe2\x80\x99s salary \xc2\xa32.17m \xe2\x80\x93 presumably for all of the above.</p> WEST BROMWICH ALBION <p>Accounts of West Bromwich Albion Football Club Ltd for the year to 30 June 2014</p>       <p>Ownership Majority owned by the chairman, Jeremy Peace.</p> <p>Turnover 18th highest, \xc2\xa387m (up from \xc2\xa370m in 2013)</p> <p>Gate receipts \xc2\xa37m</p> <p>Merchandising \xc2\xa33m</p> <p>TV and media \xc2\xa369m</p> <p>Other commercial income \xc2\xa38m</p> <p>Wage bill 12th highest, \xc2\xa365m (up from \xc2\xa354m in 2013)</p> <p>Wages as proportion of turnover 75%</p> <p>Profit before tax \xc2\xa313m (up from \xc2\xa36m in 2013)</p> <p>Net debt \xc2\xa32m</p> <p>Interest payable Nil</p> <p>Highest-paid director Unnamed, \xc2\xa31.02m (Jeremy Peace is the executive chairman)</p> <p>State they\xe2\x80\x99re in </p> <p>Sacked Steve Clarke and in January 2014 appointed Pepe Mel, who secured the fifth consecutive Premier League season for the one-time yo-yo club. The finances reflect Jeremy Peace\xe2\x80\x99s long-term determination not to blow a Premier League bounty nor overstretch to be promoted. West Brom made a profit while paying 75% of income in wages and have no debt.</p> <p>Hence the talk now of Peace looking to sell for a fabulous profit which, given the billions in TV deals, could happen at several clubs over the next year or two.</p> WEST HAM UNITED <p>Accounts of WH Holding Ltd for the year to 31 May 2014</p>       <p>Ownership Owned 51.1% by David Sullivan, 35.1% David Gold, 10% CB Holding ehf</p> <p>Turnover 10th highest, \xc2\xa3115m (up from \xc2\xa390m in 2013)</p> <p>Match receipts and football-related \xc2\xa319m</p> <p>Commercial \xc2\xa314m</p> <p>Premier League and Broadcasting \xc2\xa375m</p> <p>Retail &amp; merchandising \xc2\xa36m</p> <p>Wage bill 13th highest, \xc2\xa364m (up from \xc2\xa357m in 2013)</p> <p>Wages as proportion of turnover 56%</p> <p>Profit before tax \xc2\xa310m (following \xc2\xa34m loss in 2013)</p> <p>Net debt Not stated; total borrowings are \xc2\xa392m</p> <p>Interest payable \xc2\xa35m</p> <p>Highest-paid director Unnamed, \xc2\xa3636,000 (Karren Brady is the executive vice-chairman)</p> <p>State they\xe2\x80\x99re in</p> <p>Karren Brady, now the Conservative peer Baroness Brady of Knightsbridge, notes the 2016 Olympic stadium move means West Ham will occupy \xe2\x80\x9cone of the greatest arenas in world football\xe2\x80\x9d. Remarkable for a club in financial crisis when Brady\xe2\x80\x99s long-term employer, David Sullivan, and David Gold took over in 2010.</p> <p>Brady\xe2\x80\x99s focus and \xc2\xa349m loans from Sullivan and Gold, on which they charge 6-7% interest, have hammered the club into shape to occupy the stadium, built with around \xc2\xa3600m public money \xe2\x80\x93 surely the greatest stroke of fortune in football history.</p>'
