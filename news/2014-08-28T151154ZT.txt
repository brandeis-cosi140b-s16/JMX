b'The Fiver | The England football family requires a new patsy'


b'O CAPTAIN! OUR CAPTAIN! <p>Now that $tevie Mbe has retired from international competition, the England football family requires a new patsy to relentlessly and aggressively criticise for trying their best but not being quite as good as Andr\xc3\xa9s Iniesta, Lionel Messi or Andrea Pirlo. Oh look! Here comes Wayne Rooney! The 28-year-old striker has played 95 times for England and scored 40 goals, which is no doubt not good enough, and now he\xe2\x80\x99s been made captain so folk can criticise him for not shouting or pointing or pumping his fist in exactly the manner they\xe2\x80\x99d like him to as well.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cTo be named as England captain is a dream come true for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rooney today as he was pinned to the floor by several FA goons. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is something that I will take massive pride in doing,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, screaming, as another meaty FA apparatchik snapped a wide elasticated cotton band embroidered with an England crest around his humerus. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a kid I always loved watching a big England game on the television. Back then I had a burning ambition to play for my country. To be appointed captain is beyond my wildest dreams. I would obviously like to thank Roy and the coaching staff for having the belief and confidence in me to do the job.\xe2\x80\x9d By this point, he was clutching his knees to his chest, rocking and sobbing quite a lot.</p> <p>The poor doormat \xe2\x80\x93 who could lead England to victory at Euro 2016 and the World Cup in Russia but, modern football discourse being what it is, would still get pelters for not having beautiful gentle curls in his hair like Bobby Moore did \xe2\x80\x93 was a shoo-in for the job as far as Mr Roy was concerned. \xe2\x80\x9cWayne is an obvious choice for his honesty, commitment to the cause, his experience, the fact he has already captained England in the past,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cNow of course he\xe2\x80\x99s got that responsibility at Manchester United as well. All those factors weighed into my thought process.\xe2\x80\x9d Of course they did. Because if and when it all goes wrong, he can point out that he was doing nothing Fabio Capello and Louis van Gaal hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done already, and absolve himself of all responsibility.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE (AROUND NOW) <p>Big Cup bingo kicks off at 4.45pm BST, when it will be followed by the usual shenanigans until the draw is made and Manchester United are left with an easy \xe2\x80\xa6 ah.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBefore I signed here, I spent a month playing as Swansea to help me get to know my team-mates \xe2\x80\x93 to find out a bit more about them. Of course, I also watched video footage to see how the team played, but it is true that the game helped me learn a lot about each of my team-mates\xe2\x80\x99 characteristics \xe2\x80\x93 their age, where they used to play and their attributes\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Baf\xc3\xa9timbi Gomis explains how he used Football Manager to get to know his new Swansea City colleagues.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel.

A few weeks before the most recent World Cup, O Fiver\xc3\xa3o referred to Mexico as North American Spurs. El Tri proceeded to qualify for the advanced stages for a rather impressive sixth consecutive World Cup, only to be eliminated in the round of 16 for a rather disappointing sixth consecutive time. Given this track record, as well as being generally overhyped by their supporters and not having a clue how to harness the talents of Carlos Vela, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they really North American Arsenal?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 R Reisman.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: Daniel Price and the prizes plea (Fiver letters passim).
