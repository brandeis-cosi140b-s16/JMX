b'Will season of goodwill last in boardrooms of Premier League? | Louise Taylor'


b'<p>Ian Porterfield is synonymous with May 1973 at Wembley but the scorer of Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup-winning goal against Leeds United has another, rather more obscure, claim to fame.</p> <p>Porterfield, who died of cancer in 2007, set what would become a longstanding record when Chelsea sacked him on 15 February 1993. That was the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s inaugural season and the Scot was its first managerial casualty. Since then there has not been a campaign in England\xe2\x80\x99s top division during which the 20 managers present at kick-off in August were still occupying their posts the following February.</p> <p>Whether that is now poised to change remains very much a moot point. November and December are traditionally dangerous months for managers but this season has so far been distinguished by a remarkable absence of culling.</p> <p>For the first time since 1995-96 we have got to mid-December without a single sacking.</p> <p>Back then Roy McFarland lasted until January before falling at Bolton Wanderers. But two decades on a measure of admittedly fragile stability appears to have replaced the frenzied hiring and firing of past winters.</p> <p>Only last year Fulham\xe2\x80\x99s Martin Jol, West Brom\xe2\x80\x99s Steve Clarke, Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s Andr\xc3\xa9 Villas-Boas and Cardiff\xe2\x80\x99s Malky Mackay were handed their P45s during December and, by then, Paolo Di Canio and Ian Holloway had long since departed Sunderland and Crystal Palace.</p> <p>The poster boy for the new-found spirit of loyalty and continuity is Newcastle United\xe2\x80\x99s Alan Pardew. After spending weeks topping all available \xe2\x80\x9cnext for the axe\xe2\x80\x9d bookmakers\xe2\x80\x99 charts, Pardew choreographed a run of six victories and has just collected a manager-of-the-month award.</p> <p>Granted \xe2\x80\x9cthe chop\xe2\x80\x9d proved a key topic of conversation during his last press conference but it merely related to his back garden \xe2\x80\x93 Pardew, unusually, arrived late after having \xe2\x80\x9chad a tree surgeon to sort.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>If Premier League chairmen and owners suddenly seem markedly less trigger-happy perhaps they are simply reluctant to put themselves through all the upheaval and financial pain involved in regime change.</p> <p>Maybe the herd instinct also comes into it. Mike Ashley may not be uber-popular among his fellow owners but they will have noted that holding his nerve over Pardew paid off. Then there\xe2\x80\x99s Sam Allardyce. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the brink\xe2\x80\x9d last summer he is now masterminding a European challenge at West Ham.</p> <p>Not that the new trend for preservation of the status quo is merely about imitation being the sincerest form of flattery. Quite apart from the often daunting cost of paying off fired coaches, there are also the compensation packages for backroom staff, while the precedent set by Fulham, Cardiff and Norwich last May serves as another deterrent.</p> <p>Despite all changing managers mid-campaign \xe2\x80\x93 twice in Fulham\xe2\x80\x99s case \xe2\x80\x93 that trio were still relegated. West Brom survived, just, but their recruitment of Pepe Mel ended in tears, prompting suggestions they might have been better off sticking with Clarke.</p> <p>Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 name has been cropping up in an awful lot of sentences also containing \xe2\x80\x9caxe\xe2\x80\x9d just lately but, so far, there are no indications the Anfield board are tempted to dispense with the coach who, only months ago, led Liverpool to within touching distance of the title.</p> <p>Similarly last season\xe2\x80\x99s large turnover of top-flight coaches is almost certainly informing current events. It is, for instance, surely still too early to judge Crystal Palace\xe2\x80\x99s Neil Warnock, who stepped into the vacuum created by Tony Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s dramatic Selhurst Park exit 48 hours before the season began.</p> <p>Then there\xe2\x80\x99s the case of Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cGinger Mourinho\xe2\x80\x9d. In recent seasons winning promotion from the Championship has proved a dangerous business for coaches with several, including Chris Hughton at Newcastle, Mackay and Holloway, paying the price for \xe2\x80\x9cover-achievement\xe2\x80\x9d by departing within months of arrival in the Premier League.</p> <p>When Sean Dyche spent the opening weeks of the season striving to conjure a win many thought Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s manager would go the same way, but the Turf Moor board stood firm and now Dyche\xe2\x80\x99s side are threatening mid-table. Not that a man who once lost his job at Vicarage Road because Watford\xe2\x80\x99s Italian owners coveted Gianfranco Zola is taking anything for granted.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAnything can happen in this game,\xe2\x80\x9d says Dyche. \xe2\x80\x9cSome crazy, amazing things happen, both good and bad. There are no guarantees.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>While Dyche is performing minor miracles after spending \xc2\xa35m in the summer, Steve Bruce has invested \xc2\xa330m during 2014 yet won only a handful of League games.</p> <p>With Hull now in the relegation zone, Bruce would normally be extremely vulnerable but his feat in reaching last May\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup final seems to be insulating him.</p> <p>If Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s Nigel Pearson, QPR\xe2\x80\x99s Harry Redknapp and West Brom\xe2\x80\x99s Alan Irvine harbour greater reasons for concern as the January transfer window approaches, life at the top seems a world away from the Football League where Nigel Adkins\xe2\x80\x99 departure from Reading this week made him managerial casualty No28.</p> <p>The Championship \xe2\x80\x93 featuring 13 casualties since August and with Leeds United already on their third coach \xe2\x80\x93 is particularly hazardous.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNonsensical decisions are made all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d says a sanguine Dyche. \xe2\x80\x9cIt really is the maddest business but we all love it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a case of c\xe2\x80\x99est la vie.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> First out the door <p>92-93 Chelsea Ian Porterfield 15 Feb</p> <p>93-94 Man City Peter Reid 28 Aug</p> <p>94-95 Tottenham Ossie Ardiles 1 Nov</p> <p>95-96 Bolton Roy McFarland 2 Jan</p> <p>96-97 Blackburn Ray Harford 25 Oct</p> <p>97-98 Sheff Wed David Pleat 3 Nov</p> <p>98-99 Newcastle Kenny Dalglish 27 Aug</p> <p>99-00 Newcastle Ruud Gullit 28 Aug</p> <p>00-01 Chelsea Gianluca Vialli 12 Sep</p> <p>01-02 Leicester Peter Taylor 30 Sep</p> <p>02-03 Sunderland Peter Reid 7 Oct</p> <p>03-04 Tottenham Glenn Hoddle 21 Sep</p> <p>04-05 S\xe2\x80\x99hampton Paul Sturrock 23 Aug</p> <p>05-06 Portsmouth Alain Perrin 24 Nov</p> <p>06-07 Charlton Iain Dowie 13 Nov</p> <p>07-08 Chelsea Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho 19 Sep</p> <p>08-09 West Ham Alan Curbishley 3 Sep</p> <p>09-10 Portsmouth Paul Hart 24 Nov</p> <p>10-11 Newcastle Chris Hughton 6 Dec</p> <p>11-12 Sunderland Steve Bruce 30 Nov</p> <p>12-13 Chelsea Roberto Di Matteo 21 Nov</p> <p>13-14 Sunderland Paolo Di Canio 22 Sep</p>'
