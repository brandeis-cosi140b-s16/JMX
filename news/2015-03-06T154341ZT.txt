b'The Fiver | Turning up for work dressed like Christian Grey'


b'50 SHADES OF SILVER <p>The Fiver has a raging hot temperature. Poor Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s dripping with sweat, snot and tears and it\xe2\x80\x99s been hallucinating. It\xe2\x80\x99s been hallucinating that it\xe2\x80\x99s Roy Essandoh. It\xe2\x80\x99s been running around Fiver Towers, alarming its colleagues by throwing itself into filing cabinets while pretending to do a Keith Houchen diving header, and it\xe2\x80\x99s also painted itself silver, just like a trophy. Everyone finds that pretty worrying, too. There have been concerned looks, but it could be worse, The Fiver could have turned up for work dressed like Christian Grey. Or Stuart Gray. Or, God forbid, Michael Gray. And anyway, how about some understanding? We\xe2\x80\x99re clearly dealing with a serious case of FA Cup fever here. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bit like Capital One Cup fever, only instead of making you obsessed with credit ratings, it makes you think you have magical powers. Before you know it, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have hired Weird Uncle Fiver to be your lovely assistant.</p> <p>That\xe2\x80\x99s the power of the FA Cup in association with American Cooking Oil. The quarter-finals are upon us, a place at Wembley is in sight for four lucky clubs and what thrills and spills the weekend, and Monday night, has in store for us. It starts at Saturday lunchtime with Bradford v Reading. League One v Championship. Romance. A cabbage patch of a cabbage patch of a pitch. A tie that everyone will make a big show out of pretending to watch, because this is Real Football, a throwback to when men were men and footballs were footballs, but actually they\xe2\x80\x99ll really have used it as an opportunity to do whatever it is non-football people do with their Saturdays \xe2\x80\x93 hunting, perhaps, or visiting art galleries.</p> <p>Then it will be back to the sofa in time for the big one, the Premier League clash between the big boys, Tactics Tim\xe2\x80\x99s resurgent Aston Villa against Tracksuit Tony\xe2\x80\x99s West Brom. Whatever the score, expect plenty of touchline Tactics theatrics, which will be in stark contrast to Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 knowing clenched fist when Liverpool take the lead against Blackeye Rovers on Sunday. Rodgers had it planned all along. Brendan knows.</p> <p>But the main event is on Monday night, when Clever Lou\xe2\x80\x99s Ashley Young Experience host Almost Football Club. Almost have had a terrible record at Old Trafford since last winning there in 2006, but they\xe2\x80\x99ll be confident of victory this time given that Marouane Fellaini and Ashley Young have been the Ashley Young Experience\xe2\x80\x99s best players in recent weeks, while the stage is set for Mesut \xc3\x96zil to score the winner after Paul Scholes\xe2\x80\x99s two-footed criticism of his performances. \xe2\x80\x9cI think a player like Paul Scholes would have loved to play with Mesut \xc3\x96zil,\xe2\x80\x9d Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger yawned. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the same as when Lord Ferg was around, is it?</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs a player you take anything off the ball; pinches and kicks that are meant to wind you up. Little things like that go on in any match. But spitting is pretty low. If it happened to me and someone spat at my face or towards me then I think he\xe2\x80\x99d be eating his supper through a straw that night. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be that happy. It\xe2\x80\x99s the lowest of the low\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 cool story, Jonathan Walters.</p> RECOMMENDED VIEWING <p>Nat Coombs heads to Ebbw Vale for a chat with Neville Southall, who talks all things Everton, the city of Liverpool and why Sepp Blatter \xe2\x80\x9cis Del Boy in disguise\xe2\x80\x9d.</p>      <p>Nat\xe2\x80\x99s even found time for this explainer on the brand new soccerball season.</p>      FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMarten Allen\xe2\x80\x99s response to the 31 Millwall fans thread (Fiver letters passim) in turn reminded me of when I was a member of a particularly small away throng. Season 1989-90 (late September/early October if memory serves), the Zenith Data Systems Cup, venue: Roker Park for Sunderland v Port Vale. Being Middlesbrough fans, and having seven months earlier seen one of our favourite players (Dean Glover) expedited out of Ayresome Park suspiciously quickly (that\xe2\x80\x99s another story) to Port Vale, my dad, brother and I saw this as an excellent opportunity to see our hero in action for the first time since signing for Vale. The mythical (ie non-existent) Roker Roar was nowhere to be heard as Vale, complete with Mr Glover in the unfamiliar position of centre-back, ran out 3-1 winners much to the delight of my family and the eight other Port Vale fans standing in the away end \xe2\x80\xa6 another of which was one of my dad\xe2\x80\x99s mates who was a genuine Valiant but also lived in Middlesbrough. For a beautifully poetic end to this rather rambling tale, Vale faced Middlesbrough in the next round and lost 3-1 as Boro embarked on a cup run that would lead to a first ever appearance at Wembley\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Paul Snowdon.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy mate Billy, a lifelong Wrexham fan but living near Nottingham, went with a friend to watch them at Notts County in an evening fixture. By kick-off, no supporters coaches from Wrexham had arrived and so the two of them were quite alone in the away end. Then Wrexham scored and they jumped up and down celebrating. The County fans responded with the chilling: \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll see you both outside\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 David Barton.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: footballers in rap lyrics. If we go back to the heady days of 1994, Aswad namechecked Ian Wright in their hit \xe2\x80\x98Shine\xe2\x80\x99. Not content with a footballer, they also include a couple of boxers, a sprinter and a hurdler (Nigel Benn, Chris Eubank, Linford Christie and Colin Jackson). Technically it\xe2\x80\x99s a reggae track rather than rap, but the name-checking does take place in the rap bit\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Lee Manuel.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
