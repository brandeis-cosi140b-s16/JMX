b'The Fiver | Balance sheet bantz; and Adriano'


b'SO MANY QUESTIONS, SUCH LITTLE TIME <p>With so many Arsenal fans priced out of attending actual matches at the Emirates Stadium by football\xe2\x80\x99s most expensive ticket prices, it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that so many settled for the next best thing by pitching up at the club\xe2\x80\x99s AGM this morning, to which entry was free of charge. Chaired by giant green dinosaur and club mascot Gunnersaurus, the session of sizzling balance sheet bantz was every bit as exciting as you\xe2\x80\x99d expect, but at least afforded Gooners the chance to moan at club owner Stan Kroenke, his board and manager Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger about the many different defenders and holding midfielders on whom they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to spend the many millions of quid they made last year.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is quite untrue that we are sitting on a huge cash pile for some unspecified reason,\xe2\x80\x9d said club chief executive Ivan Gazidis, torpedoing today\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver joke about him having scrabbled down the back of his cash pile in order to find the big sofa on which they were actually sitting. Gazidis went on to explain that almost half of the \xc2\xa3207.9m cash balance revealed in May\xe2\x80\x99s accounts is already accounted for, which means the wealth on which he, Kroenke, Wenger and club chairman Sir Chips \xe2\x80\x9cChips\xe2\x80\x9d Keswick are forced to metaphorically recline is a comparatively paltry, lumpy and uncomfortable \xc2\xa3108.9m.</p> <p>During a largely good-humoured meeting in which the FA Cup received a round of applause just for taking the bare look off the room and subjects as diverse as ticket prices, ticket availability, fan travel, the elderly white male profile of the Arsenal board, safe standing, Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s eventual successor, sports analytics and a mysterious \xc2\xa33m fee paid by Arsenal to Kroenke Sports Enterprises in the USA were addressed, the warmest welcome was of course reserved for Wenger. \xe2\x80\x9cI know I don\xe2\x80\x99t always please you like I would love to and that in front of every season there is an apprehension,\xe2\x80\x9d he told fans, playing to the gallery before offering an explanation for his side\xe2\x80\x99s stuttering start to the season. \xe2\x80\x9cWe still lack a bit of confidence and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been hit hard by injuries,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMany are not soft-tissue injuries but accidental injuries.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Among the many knocks and niggles with which Arsenal have been clattered hard, studs-up from behind is Mesut \xc3\x96zil\xe2\x80\x99s knee-knack, which could sideline the German midfielder for up to three months. Wenger used his pre-AGM press briefing to deny reports he\xe2\x80\x99d let \xc3\x96zil play Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s entire game against Chelsea despite knowing about the knack. Having been assured, incorrectly as it turns out, that his player had a throbbing knee but wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too bad, Wenger claims he told \xc3\x96zil to let him know if he needed to come off. \xe2\x80\x9cHe did not do that and I left him on for the whole game because we needed to score goals and he can deliver the final ball,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained.</p> <p>Meanwhile at Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s training ground, the few remaining fit players in the squad were fielding less taxing, if far more interesting and revealing questions in an internet Q&amp;A from which all emerged mercifully unscathed ahead of this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s big match against Hull City. It turns out Per Mertesacker thinks he\xe2\x80\x99s quite honest and handsome, attributes his beanpole height to drinking milk as a kid and is fond of baked beans. David Ospina\xe2\x80\x99s favourite music is Reggaeton and if Mathieu Flamini could have one super power he\xe2\x80\x99d like to be able to fly. Should things get physical with Mohamed Diam\xc3\xa9 on Saturday, he may very well get his wish.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a miracle that we only had six or seven injured with blows to the face, neck and back. If you saw some of the bodies \xe2\x80\xa6 they really caught it. What would have happened if instead of a chair, it had been a knife? Our lives were in danger\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Albania skipper Lorik Cana reflects on the wild scenes that forced the abandonment of their Euro 2016 qualifier in Serbia. Meanwhile, Nebojsa Stefanovic, Serbian interior minister, has waded into a potential diplomatic incident by parping: \xe2\x80\x9cWe believe that [Albania] are not mature enough as a state to join the European family.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> THE EMPEROR\xe2\x80\x99S NEW WOES? <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI had his agent over several times, he confirmed Adriano\xe2\x80\x99s coming. Adriano is seeking to launch himself again\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 optimistic Le Havre president Christophe Maillol thinks Ligue 2 is just the place for the big-boned former Brazil striker to showcase his famous commitment to football. Here\xe2\x80\x99s an in-no-way-repackaged-and-rebooted! reminder of that special commitment from Fivers past \xe2\x80\xa6</p> <p>September 2006 Inter team-mate Sinisa Mihajlovic orders Adriano to lose weight: \xe2\x80\x9cHe has to lose weight immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>October 2006 Brazil coach Dunga drops Adriano, telling him to \xe2\x80\x9cchange his ways\xe2\x80\x9d.</p>     \xe2\x80\x98Which ways?\xe2\x80\x99 Photograph: Paco Serinelli/AFP/Getty Images    <p>February 2007 Inter coach Roberto Mancini drops Adriano after he misses training due to the after-effects of his birthday the night before.</p> <p>March 2007 Adriano says a misunderstanding was behind a trendy nightspot altercation with US basketball player Rolando Howell. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m tired of every single and small event in my life being exaggerated and used against me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>November 2007 Adriano sent on unpaid leave back to S\xc3\xa3o Paulo to attend a physiotherapy and physiology sporting recovery centre.</p> <p>February 2008 Adriano is sent off for headbutting Santos full-back Domingos, then fined for arriving late in training, before having an altercation with a photographer. \xe2\x80\x9cThe team does not miss him,\xe2\x80\x9d says sporting director Marco Aur\xc3\xa9lio Cunha. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he is not happy at S\xc3\xa3o Paulo he is free to go.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>June 2008 Adriano is sent back to Inter. S\xc3\xa3o Paulo sporting director Carlos Augusto de Barros e Silva: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a balanced squad and it was better for Adriano to go.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>October 2008 New Inter coach Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho drops Adriano and sends him home after he arrives late for training amid reports he had been out at a nightclub.</p> <p>January 2009 Mourinho tells Adriano to lose weight: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s clear that he is three or four kilos overweight.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>March 2009 Brazilian newspaper Extra reports that Adriano hosted a 12-hour \xe2\x80\x9cwild party\xe2\x80\x9d with a tr@nsvestite model.</p> <p>April 2009 Adriano fails to return from international duty amid reports he has attempted to take his own life after a relationship break-up. Extra report he has been spotted at a party hosted by a local drug dealer \xe2\x80\x9cwith two pistols in his belt, smoking marijuana and drinking relentlessly. He cried, complained about fame and said \xe2\x80\x98money isn\xe2\x80\x99t everything\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d He denies the story and police say no allegations of criminal behaviour were made against him. Inter rescind his contract.</p> <p>October 2009 After joining Flamengo, Adriano admits alcohol problems were behind his Inter exit. \xe2\x80\x9cI went out every night and drank whatever happened to be in front of me, wine, whisky, beer \xe2\x80\xa6 a lot of beer.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>March 2010 Flamengo president Patricia Amorin warns Adriano he must change if he is to go to the World Cup. \xe2\x80\x9cEach person reaps what they sow.\xe2\x80\x9d Adriano doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go to the World Cup.</p> <p>June 2010 Adriano joins Roma.</p> <p>February 2011 Adriano misses medical, Roma tear up contract a month later.</p> <p>March 2011 Adriano joins Corinthians. \xe2\x80\x9cCorinthians won\xe2\x80\x99t regret it, I\xe2\x80\x99m a fighting player. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going there to create trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>March 2012 Adriano\xe2\x80\x99s Corinthians contract is terminated after he misses training and refuses to let the club doctor weigh him. \xe2\x80\x9cHe never made even the slightest effort to work hard and secure his future. Only a madman would sign him now,\xe2\x80\x9d says the club\xe2\x80\x99s former player Neto.</p> <p>August 2012 Adriano signs a pay-as-you-play deal back at Flamengo. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to honour this shirt, which has always been mine, with a lot of goals.\xe2\x80\x9d Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t play a game for them.</p> <p>January 2014 Adriano returns to football with Atl\xc3\xa9tico Paranaense. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s gratifying to be back, especially after so much hard work and dedication.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>April 2014 Released after four games and two missed training sessions. \xe2\x80\x9cMy time with the club was very gratifying. Now I can keep doing what I like doing the most, which is to play football,\xe2\x80\x9d honks Adriano.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel.

Write an (un)funny tea-time email, perhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Woody Phillips.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI read many an article yesterday about ticket prices. On the one hand, I look back through rose-tinted glasses to the early 90s when I\xe2\x80\x99d just got a company car and we zoomed across the nation from weekend to weekend, scarves trailing out of the windows. We went to every game, ate many pies and drank much Bovril. In the process thoroughly enjoying ourselves and making memories for life, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t ever remember the cost of tickets being a consideration. That said, if I think back a bit harder, I also remember peeing in concrete troughs like cattle, finding chunks of I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what in the pies, watching some pretty bad football and getting duffed up once or twice after parking in the wrong area. So in summation: swings and roundabouts\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Marten Allen.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLeaving aside Elmore Leonard\xe2\x80\x99s Third Rule of Great Writing (\xe2\x80\x98Never use a verb other than \xe2\x80\x9csaid\xe2\x80\x9d to carry dialogue: the line of dialogue belongs to the character; the verb is the writer sticking his nose in\xe2\x80\x99) if Dan McSweeney (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters) has genuinely got as far as The Fiver in his search for a template for the Great American Novel, then I\xe2\x80\x99d suggest, kindly, that that boat has not merely sailed, but been torpedoed and come to rest at the bottom of the Marianas Trench. There\xe2\x80\x99s ironic treatment of narrative forms, and then there\xe2\x80\x99s that\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Simon Bell.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough it is right to punish CSKA Moscow for their fans\xe2\x80\x99 behaviour by forcing them to play behind closed doors, it does appear unfair on Manchester City as well.

Then enter this here competition.</p> BITS AND BOBS <p>Pep Guardiola has denied that Bar\xc3\xa7a ever played tiki-taka under his management, which is a bit like Johan Cruyff denying his legs ever did a Cruyff turn. \xe2\x80\x9cTiki-taka means passing the ball for the sake of it, with no clear intention \xe2\x80\xa6 Bar\xc3\xa7a didn\xe2\x80\x99t do tiki-taka,\xe2\x80\x9d squeaked Pep in his new booky wook. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s completely made up.

Now, I\xe2\x80\x99ve realised that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Gareth Southgate has been rewarded with a new contract for taking the England U-21s to the European Championships, a feat that every single England U-21 manager since 2006 has managed to do before.</p> <p>And Mario Balotelli has shown that his recent goal drought and Italy snub has not harmed his sense of humour. \xe2\x80\x9c[$tevie Mbe] is an amazing player,\xe2\x80\x9d he honked. \xe2\x80\x9cI had really not seen much of him before this season, apart from for England, but wow.
