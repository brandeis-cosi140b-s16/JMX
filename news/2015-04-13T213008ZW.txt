b'Wayne Rooney says Manchester United targeted City\xe2\x80\x99s lazy runners'


b'<p>Wayne Rooney has revealed that Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s victory over Manchester City was based on making the champions pay for having players who are unable to track runners.</p> <p>Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 was criticised by the TV pundit Gary Neville for a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete dereliction of duty\xe2\x80\x9d. Although Rooney did not name the City midfielder, he said of a team who also included Fernandinho, James Milner, David Silva and Jes\xc3\xbas Navas: \xe2\x80\x9cWe know some of the City players are not the best at getting back and defending and tracking runners and we felt we could make them pay for that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Marouane Fellaini, who scored United\xe2\x80\x99s second goal and had a hand in two others, dominated Tour\xc3\xa9 to continue his resurgence under Louis van Gaal. Rooney said: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s getting used in the right way. He\xe2\x80\x99s a handful for defenders to mark. As you can see we like to try to play out from the back but, if teams are pressing us, it is an option for us and he\xe2\x80\x99s probably the best in world football at bringing the ball down, getting us out of that pressure and getting us further down the pitch. So the manager is using him in the right way and he is repaying the manager with goals and good performances.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s Michael Carrick: so smooth he plays in a dinner jacket | Barney Ronay </p>   <p>Fellaini, signed by David Moyes in summer 2013, became the symbol of the dismal campaign under the Scot. \xe2\x80\x9cIn fairness to Felli he kept his head down, worked hard and he\xe2\x80\x99s come through that tough period and is showing what he was doing at Everton and why Manchester United bought him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rooney. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a quality player, he is a different option for us and happily it is starting to show on the pitch.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Rooney said United are confident of denting Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s title bid at Stamford Bridge on Saturday. United are eight points behind Chelsea, who have a match in hand.</p> <p>City followed Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur in becoming direct rivals defeated by United recently and the match against Chelsea holds no fear for Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s team. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re confident, we\xe2\x80\x99re on a good run of form, we\xe2\x80\x99ve beaten some very good teams in the last few games,\xe2\x80\x9d Rooney said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a big test for us, Chelsea are top of the league. We will work and prepare on the training pitch and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be ready for the game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As Arsenal are only a point ahead United have a chance of finishing second. Rooney said: \xe2\x80\x9cChelsea are in a very commanding position so we have to just trying to win our games. I think we are playing nice football, we are winning games and we have to continue that to the end of the season, finish as high up as we can, and then hopefully take form into next season.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>United\xe2\x80\x99s progress is illustrated by the club heading the mini-league of the top seven sides, with six wins, two draws and two defeats. \xe2\x80\x9cIn some ways there is more space in those bigger games because those teams like to come and attack,\xe2\x80\x9d Rooney said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe certainly felt [against City] we could capitalise on that. We\xe2\x80\x99ve found it tough when some teams have sat back so that\xe2\x80\x99s something we need to work on.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Rooney warned United are not the finished article. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re still a work in progress, learning certain things as well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s great we\xe2\x80\x99re winning games, and the performances we are showing but we have to continue that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
