b'Atl\xc3\xa9tico\xe2\x80\x99s Fernando Torres happy with cameo role as Real Madrid clash beckons'


b'<p>The first time Fernando Torres went to the Vicente Calder\xc3\xb3n to watch Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid was just over 20 years ago, one cold day in January 1995. His grandfather Eulalio had already made an Atl\xc3\xa9tico fan of him and that afternoon over lunch someone suggested heading to the match. Torres remembers Diego Simeone but otherwise his \xe2\x80\x98debut\xe2\x80\x99, a 1-1 draw with Compostela, was not particularly memorable and was far from glorious. Which was appropriate, somehow.</p> <p>Eighteen months later Atl\xc3\xa9tico won the double but those were their only trophies in what would be an 18-year run. Eulalio had long filled Torres\xe2\x80\x99s head with talk of suffering and sacrifice, about how being an Atl\xc3\xa9tico meant \xe2\x80\x9cresisting Real Madrid\xe2\x80\x9d, and at school in Fuenlabrada he\xe2\x80\x99d found out for himself. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was young almost everyone was a Real fan. I\xe2\x80\x99d go in wearing my Atl\xc3\xa9tico tracksuit just to wind them up,\xe2\x80\x9d he later recalled. \xe2\x80\x9cBut on the inside I was almost always pissed off because the team had lost that weekend.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Things did not get much better when he started wearing an Atl\xc3\xa9tico tracksuit to work. Aged just 12, Albacete had tried to buy him in order to then sell on to Real, who had a non-aggression agreement with Atl\xc3\xa9tico, but he had stayed. It would be more than a decade before he departed and when eventually he did, he did so sadly.</p> <p>Torres made his debut in the Second Division at 17, an idol for supporters who sang his name to the tune of Can\xe2\x80\x99t Take My Eyes Off You \xe2\x80\x93 he was described by one columnist as \xe2\x80\x9cone part prodigy, one part folk hero, one part native son, one part messiah\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 and he played for Atl\xc3\xa9tico for seven years, helping them return to the First Division, but he did not win anything and was never close. He recently revealed that Atl\xc3\xa9tico\xe2\x80\x99s fans encouraged him to leave, for his own sake.</p> <p>Being an Atl\xc3\xa9tico fan means being antimadridista, Torres admitted: they are defined in part by their neighbours, by who they are not.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cKids might say: \xe2\x80\x98Why should we be Atl\xc3\xa9tico fans when they always lose and Madrid fans are always so happy?\xe2\x80\x99 But Madrid fans aren\xe2\x80\x99t always happy. Being an Atl\xc3\xa9tico fan makes you suffer but it makes you stronger too,\xe2\x80\x9d he said back then. \xe2\x80\x9cOur fans are prisoners of a feeling; theirs are prisoners of results.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Yet Atl\xc3\xa9ticos could not be happy either and the results were Real\xe2\x80\x99s. Torres, Atl\xc3\xa9tico\xe2\x80\x99s outstanding player, left because he felt he was heading in one direction, the club in another. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to stay until I\xe2\x80\x99ve matured [and] can\xe2\x80\x99t go any further, then I\xe2\x80\x99d like to be at a club that can win things. What I\xe2\x80\x99d really like is for that club to be Atl\xc3\xa9tico ...\xe2\x80\x9d he had said a couple of years earlier, already suspecting what he would later accept: Atl\xc3\xa9tico would not be that club. He departed having never beaten Real Madrid. Not once.</p> <p>And then, seven and a half years later, he returned.</p> <p>Things are different now. Torres returned to Atl\xc3\xa9tico a world and European champion, via Liverpool, London and Milan. In the meantime, under Simeone, the man he had watched that winter\xe2\x80\x99s afternoon and then later captained, Atl\xc3\xa9tico had started winning too. They\xe2\x80\x99d beaten Real for the first time in 14 years and 25 matches to win the Copa del Rey at the Santiago Bernab\xc3\xa9u and had taken the league title, 18 years on. \xe2\x80\x9cThe club has changed completely,\xe2\x80\x9d Torres said when he came back to the place he described as his \xe2\x80\x9conly home\xe2\x80\x9d. He was about to experience first hand just how much.</p> <p>Presented on a Sunday in front of 45,000 fans, three days later Torres defeated Real for the first time with Atl\xc3\xa9tico. Eight days after that he travelled to the Bernab\xc3\xa9u and beat Real again. Atl\xc3\xa9tico won 2-0; Torres scored them both, his first ever goals at his rivals\xe2\x80\x99 home. It took him 38 seconds of the first half to score and 35 seconds of the second half to score again, knocking Real out. In the next round he scored after 38 seconds against Barcelona, his first Calder\xc3\xb3n goal in almost 3,000 days. He knelt down and kissed the turf.</p> <p>Atl\xc3\xa9tico were knocked out that night, losing 2-3, but when Real Madrid next visited in the league Torres crossed for Mario Mandzukic to score the fourth in a 4-0 win, their biggest derby victory in 64 years and their first home league win against Real in 17 seasons. As for Torres, he had gone from no wins in seven years to three in less than a month. Not a bad way to come home.</p> <p>And yet Torres\xe2\x80\x99s figures since returning are actually fairly modest: he has four goals so far and in the league has scored as many in his own goal as in the oppositions\xe2\x80\x99 goal, with one in 12 league games, seven of them starts. He has none in two Champions League games, one assist in the league, none in Europe. That third goal for Atl\xc3\xa9tico, against Barcelona in the cup, had come from his third shot. Away at Sevilla he was superb, away at M\xc3\xa1laga last weekend he was poor, but his performances have been steady rather than spectacular.</p> <p>All of which is fine \xe2\x80\x93 and roughly as anticipated. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fans are happy, his arrival is doing us good, even if some people doubted him,\xe2\x80\x9d Simeone said. When the signing was announced, the manager had talked about the sense of \xe2\x80\x9cbelonging\xe2\x80\x9d that Torres brings but he talked more about what he could offer on the pitch, insisting: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m only interested in the footballing side of his return.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFernando is not our saviour,\xe2\x80\x9d Simeone said and nor did he want Torres to be Atl\xc3\xa9tico\xe2\x80\x99s saviour; what he wanted was for Torres to be useful, giving depth to the squad and a different outlet, another type of striker, a player to stretch the game. To help others as much as himself.</p> <p>Torres\xe2\x80\x99s attitude was similar. In conversations with the club, Torres said he wanted them to buy a player, not an icon. Torres may be a star, his shirt outselling all others, but he came willingly to play a supporting role \xe2\x80\x93 Mandzukic is the lead No9 and has 12 league goals while Antoine Griezmann is the star of the forward line, on 18. Only Torres has the status that Simeone does, but what Simeone says is \xe2\x80\x9cGospel\xe2\x80\x9d, the striker insists. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I spoke to [Simeone] about returning, I knew what he wanted: he wants players to help the team and anyone who does not fit that is going to have problems,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m here to be useful.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m happy with him,\xe2\x80\x9d Simeone said last week. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is combining better with team-mates. He is giving the team what we need, working very hard, engaging the defence and creating space and giving freedom to Griezmann.\xe2\x80\x9d An auxiliary role, then. A secondary one, in fact. But one in which he can be useful and one in which he will be used, in which he has occasionally been decisive.</p> <p>Mandzukic is the natural choice up front. He returns from injury and will start on Tuesday, according to Simeone. In the last round against Bayer Leverkusen Torres came on for the Croat. Simeone\xe2\x80\x99s original plan that night had been not to deploy Torres, using a midfielder instead, but yellow cards for both of Bayer\xe2\x80\x99s central defenders changed his mind.</p> <p>So on went Torres. And when it went to penalties, the manager had no doubts: the 31-year old \xe2\x80\x98Kid\xe2\x80\x99 would take the fifth. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had the experience and rank for it,\xe2\x80\x9d Simeone said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen it went in my heart nearly burst out of my chest,\xe2\x80\x9d Torres admitted. In his first ever Champions League game at the Calder\xc3\xb3n his penalty flew into the net and then Jan Oblak saved the next, sending Atl\xc3\xa9tico through to the quarter-final. There a familiar rival awaits.</p>'
