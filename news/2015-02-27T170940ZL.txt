b'Liverpool v Manchester City: match preview'


b'<p>The Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s in-form team host the reigning champions but both will be smarting from painful European experiences this week. Brendan Rodgers claimed City would have a \xe2\x80\x9ccrucial\xe2\x80\x9d advantage owing to Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Europa League trip to Besiktas, and that was before the tie went to extra time and his squad arrived back from Istanbul at 4.19am on Friday owing to a delayed flight. A comparatively refreshed City can exert more pressure on Capital One Cup finalists Chelsea by closing the gap to two points with a first win at Anfield since May 2003.
