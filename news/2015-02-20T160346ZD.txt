Top- five things-to-do-on-a-Thursday-night-instead-of-watching-Big-Vase lists. The latest one of the last one is a good one. It goes: 5) Rewatch Spice World; 4) Get trampled on by an elephant; 3) Look at Twitter; 2) Listen to Ocean Colour Scene; 1) Spend time with friend and family. With all of those tasks undertaken and Big Vase duly avoided, the Fiver was pretty pooped and ready for some solid sack time. But with all the bleating going on in the background, it lay there, more awake than a kid\xe2\x80\x99s programme hosted by Timmy Mallett, mentally updating that second list.</p> <p>When morning finally came and a red-eyed Fiver investigated the cause of the noise, it seemed Mario Balotelli was to blame. You see the striker struck a late penalty, Liverpool won a game because of that late penalty and that\xe2\x80\x99s what everyone was getting so animated about. Except it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. You see, dear reader, there was a bit of a donnybrook before the penalty could be taken. Jordan Henderson and Daniel Sturridge were determined to grab the glory and so ensued the sort of tug-of-war with a ball generally reserved for the type of special videos Weird Uncle Fiver watches alone on a Saturday night. The problem with this \xe2\x80\x93 the penalty, not the videos, each to his own and all that \xe2\x80\x93 is that Henderson has never actually scored one in his entire career and Sturridge\xe2\x80\x99s last effort against Everton has just passed Neptune and shows no signs of letting up. Balotelli, though, is cooler than a fish\xe2\x80\x99s fart when it comes to them and 93% of the time, he scores. So instead of being praised for taking responsibility and pushing one inexperienced taker and one no-hoper out of the way before giving his side a chance of going further in a European competition, people are droning on about disrespect. </p> <p>Well it was probably just some jumped-up tweeter looking to generate controversy and more followers, right? It\xe2\x80\x99s not like his own captain was doing it on live, prime-time TV in front of a shedload of viewers, right? Oh! \xe2\x80\x9cI think Mario has been a bit mischievous by stepping in front of him [Henderson] and going against what the manager\xe2\x80\x99s planned before the game\xe2\x80\x9d hung-out-to-dry $tevie MBE. \xe2\x80\x9cCredit to him, he\xe2\x80\x99s scored. But it would be very interesting in that dressing room if he\xe2\x80\x99d have missed that penalty. It\xe2\x80\x99s not nice to see when players are taking it off each other and stuff, for me, rules are rules and codes are codes inside a dressing room and when a manager selects a penalty-taker that player should take it. Jordan is the captain and Mario showed Jordan a bit of disrespect there.\xe2\x80\x9d </p> <p>Afterwards, Brendan took to the mic and joked \xe2\x80\x9c[$tevie MBE] should\xe2\x80\x99ve taken it\xe2\x80\x9d and he smiled and it was all a bit awkward because it was a bad joke and no one laughed and it was late and everyone just wanted to go home. Balotelli, meanwhile, took to that site designed to let people make it look like they\xe2\x80\x99re having a good time by putting a filter on a poorly-taken photo when inside they are screaming for any sort of human contact to help ease the pain of loneliness, to say \xe2\x80\x9cThank you hendo for let me take the penalty. Stop drama now.\xe2\x80\x9d That seems like some pretty good advice. Let\xe2\x80\x99s stop the drama. Now. </p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9c[Mr] Roy will have a team that can really compete. I would be disappointed if [England] don\xe2\x80\x99t at least get to the semi-finals [of Euro 2016] and then I could see us having a real go at winning it\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 former football manager \xe2\x80\x98Arry Redknapp gives comedy a go.</p> THE LAST (WE PROMISE) OF YOUR MUNDANE ENCOUNTERS WITH FAMOUS PEOPLE <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSome years ago I was drinking alone in a pub on Tottenham Court Road when I fell into conversation with a Swedish bloke. The subject soon turned to football and, being a Leicester fan, I immediately asked him if he knew of Pontus Kamark, at the time enjoying a highly successful spell at Filbert Street under Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Neill. To my befuddled delight and amazement he pulled out his phone, called a contact and passed the handset to me. \xe2\x80\x98Who is speaking please?\xe2\x80\x99 I heard on the other end. \xe2\x80\x98Er \xe2\x80\xa6 Steve \xe2\x80\xa6 who is this please?\xe2\x80\x99 I stuttered. \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s Pontus Kamark\xe2\x80\x99 came the reply \xe2\x80\x98but isn\xe2\x80\x99t this (Swedish bloke\xe2\x80\x99s) phone?\xe2\x80\x99 There followed a couple of minutes of very pleasant chit-chat where he seemed genuinely pleased to hear from a supporter and I gently chastised him for a shocking miss against Spurs the week earlier. I hung up the phone and handed it back, and to be honest remember nothing of the afternoon beyond that point\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Steve Smith.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWandering down a busy London street the day after another disappointing England performance, my co-Liverpool supporting mate Pete and I were wondering whether Emile Heskey had been subbed the night before due to injury, or just because he was a bit crap. Luckily, David Davies of the FA was walking towards us. He was happy to confirm that Emile wasn\xe2\x80\x99t injured at all, and that he would be available to be crap for the Reds at the weekend. Phew!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ian Martindale.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs a seven-year-old back in the mid-eighties, I was given the opportunity to hone my football skills at Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s summer soccer school, the highlight of which would be the appearance of a couple of players at the end of the week to join in a game. The anticipation was high as Friday approached and the two players that would be joining us were revealed as jinking fan favourite Peter Beardsley along with the \xe2\x80\x98Peter Crouch of the small shorts era\xe2\x80\x99 George Reilly. As the coaches revealed who would be playing on each team, there was an audible groan from the team that had been awarded Reilly. As Beardsley stood there openly laughing at this reaction, poor old George looked crestfallen. Even as a seven-year-old I felt bad for him\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ben Graham.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhile nodding in agreement to Fiver readers\xe2\x80\x99 descriptions of agricultural and industrial tackles, I leap in to suggest that the progression to \xe2\x80\x98technological\xe2\x80\x99 tackling is misunderstood. Technology today is centered on virtual reality and in football we have progressed to the \xe2\x80\x98virtual tackle\xe2\x80\x99, as demonstrated by Wayne Rooney against Preston. The virtual tackle has all the outcomes of a real tackle (yellow card, free kick, crunching to the turf, etc) but does not actually take place\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 John Daykin.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in full agreement with Todd Van Allen. This series of mundane meetings has got too far. At least Fiver can say it has more than two readers. But how many of these mundane meetings are true? And can anything be more mundane than my having attended the same school (Fatima College) in Trinidad with cricket great Brian Lara? Even being in detention together?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Nigel Assam.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

Could he be in line to replace Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger? In a word: no.</p> <p>And in heartwarming story of the day, Jay Beatty, an 11-year-old Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Celtic fan who has Down\xe2\x80\x99s syndrome, has won Scotland\xe2\x80\x99s goal of the month award! Huzzah!</p> STILL WANT MORE? <p>When Jacob Steinberg and Nick Miller hang out they usually like to spend the time discussing which album is better, the Human League\xe2\x80\x99s Dare or ABC\xe2\x80\x99s Lexicon of Love. But this week they decided to write about 10 things to look out for in the English top flight instead.</p> <p>Gregg Bakowski is more of a Roxy Music man and will try to interject in that argument by suggesting Avalon is much better than both. Gregg also likes Jan Molby and a goal he scored against Manchester United. In fact, he likes it so much he wrote 1213 words about it.</p> <p>Ian McCourt never really got into the new romantic movement as his hands are not steady enough to apply eyeliner and he was too embarrassed to ask his sister to do it for him. But he does know where Marco Reus will be playing football come the start of next season.</p> <p>Barney Ronay has no time for this music palaver. He is too busy writing about David Luiz.</p> <p>And neither has Alan Smith. He is too busy explaining why loanees are now key to winning promotion to the Promised Land.</p> <p>Oh, and if it\xe2\x80\x99s your thing \xe2\x80\xa6 you can follow Big Website on Big Social FaceSpace.</p> SIGN UP TO THE FIVER <p>Want your very own copy of our free tea-timely(ish) email sent direct to your inbox?
