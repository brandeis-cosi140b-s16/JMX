b'Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 has Manchester City doubts despite Manuel Pellegrini assurances'


b'<p>Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 has suggested he could leave Manchester City in the close season, though Manuel Pellegrini has denied the midfielder remains unhappy after last summer\xe2\x80\x99s falling-out with the club.</p> <p>Tour\xc3\xa9 had a public dispute with the champions due to disquiet over the lack of club celebrations for his birthday, a couple of days after City won the Premier League title.</p> <p>Tour\xc3\xa9, who is with Ivory Coast for the Africa Cup of Nations, which starts on Saturday, was asked if he wanted to stay at City. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a big question and that\xe2\x80\x99s an easy question as well, and you have an easy answer \xe2\x80\x93 we\xe2\x80\x99ll see,\xe2\x80\x9d the 31-year-old told CNN. Pressed if he would be at City next season, Tour\xc3\xa9 said: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99m at City at the moment.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>These comments were put to Pellegrini and the manager claimed: \xe2\x80\x9cYaya is 100% committed with our team and with this team. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any doubts about that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>But asked why the Ivorian would admit he could leave if he was committed to the club, Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think any of us know what will happen in six months more. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know where you can be. We cannot know what will happen in the future. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a problem with his commitment.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Chilean tried to shrug off the idea that Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s comments were related to last summer\xe2\x80\x99s dispute over his birthday and a perceived lack of recognition for the midfielder. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, you can\xe2\x80\x99t link one thing with the other. I repeat Yaya is very happy here. His commitment with our club is not a problem.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>City host Arsenal on Sunday and Pellegrini revealed that if the timing had been different he might have considered signing Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez, who joined the Gunners in July. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not easy. He was a very expensive player in that moment. In the moment Barcelona sold him to Arsenal we were not searching for one striker because we had in that moment Jovetic, Ag\xc3\xbcero, Negredo and Dzeko but I am sure Alexis can play everywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d the manager said.</p> <p>Of the qualities of the striker, who has scored 12 Premier League goals, Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cAlexis is a very good player, he is doing a very good season in England. It is not easy for a player in his first season here to score so many goals. Alexis is repeating what he did in the last two seasons at Barcelona and scoring a lot of goals.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>City\xe2\x80\x99s 1-1 draw with Everton last weekend allowed Chelsea to take a two-point lead in the chase for the championship. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if we dropped two points or if we won one,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is difficult to know about that. Last year we draw here against Sunderland and it was a very important point to go on and win the title. We have to play 17 games more and that is 51 points. I think that 51 and 47 are 98.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe can drop points and win the title. I am sure that all the teams will drop points between now and the end of the year. The less you drop, the better but it is important to try to recover to the top of the table in this month.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>City\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa325m signing of Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s countryman Wilfried Bony was questioned by Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho. Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s manager said: \xe2\x80\x9cGood striker. If they have the money and no problems with FFP, well done. Rules are different for City.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Predictably, Pellegrini refused to comment. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he said, so I cannot talk about that. Financial things are the same for all the teams,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero is now fully recovered following a knee injury. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, he is working with the squad every day so he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any problems. We will see if he starts but he is 100 % fit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pellegrini.</p> <p>Samir Nasri, though, has a calf injury which means the midfielder will not play against his old club. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will be out around three weeks or a month,\xe2\x80\x9d the manager said before offering an update on Vincent Kompany and Edin Dzeko, who were each recently injured. \xe2\x80\x9cVincent is 100% fit. He will be OK without problems. We have some doubts about Edin. We must wait to see what the doctor says, what the player says and then we will decide.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
