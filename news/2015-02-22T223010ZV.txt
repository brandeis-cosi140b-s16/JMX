b'<p>Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s demolition of Newcastle United was followed by Vincent Kompany sending a bullish message to Lionel Messi, Neymar, and Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez before Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League encounter with Barcelona.</p> <p>The Catalan club knocked City out of the competition at the same last-16 stage last year but the captain shrugged when asked about Bar\xc3\xa7a\xe2\x80\x99s three world-class forwards.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFear? We don\xe2\x80\x99t fear them. You don\xe2\x80\x99t go in at this level fearing strikers. We want to play against them. It\xe2\x80\x99s the fourth time in a year now,\xe2\x80\x9d Kompany said as the squad prepare for the first leg at the Etihad Stadium. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing new to worry us, it\xe2\x80\x99s a case of having the whole team at a very high level. They\xe2\x80\x99re a special team with special players, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The defender went further, claiming that Stoke City, who City beat 4-1 in their last away trip, can be more difficult opponents. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir [Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s] ability is not about hurting you all game \xe2\x80\x93 you can have tougher games when you go to Stoke City. It\xe2\x80\x99s about the fact they can decide a game within a second. They have more players than anyone else in the world who can finish games with a touch of magic.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Last season City went down 4-1 on aggregate to Barca, losing the opening leg at the Etihad 2-0. Of what that result may mean, Kompany said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou play top teams every season and it\xe2\x80\x99s unpredictable. You hope that on your day you can beat them but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s the same for us as it is for them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>City are yet to defeat a continental heavyweight club in the Champions League when the opponents needed victory. Asked if there is a determination to prove they can do so, Kompany said: \xe2\x80\x9cOur team has been proving our determination in recent years. That\xe2\x80\x99s one thing when you look back on this team in the future you will never be able to say we did not have. We\xe2\x80\x99ve always come back.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re putting in a fight again for the Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 you saw that [against Newcastle]. And we\xe2\x80\x99ll put in a fight for the Champions League too. The history of this club tells you that in the past six years we always keep progressing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Within two minutes of kick-off it appeared set to be the longest of days for John Carver\xe2\x80\x99s side in a contest that had Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9, back from Africa Cup of Nations duty, running proceedings.</p> <p>Edin Dzeko won a penalty following Vurnon Anita\xe2\x80\x99s clumsy challenge which Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero coolly slotted and they were coasting. Goals from Samir Nasri and Dzeko \xe2\x80\x93 his first since 27 September \xe2\x80\x93 had City leading 3-0 at the interval. David Silva\xe2\x80\x99s double early in the second half meant the Spaniard could be removed on 59 minutes and after Wilfried Bony, the \xc2\xa325m signing, came on for his debut the failure to finish when through on Tim Krul\xe2\x80\x99s goal hardly mattered.</p> <p>Carver, refreshingly, pointed the finger at his team for their weak effort. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating but you can only show them and talk about what they will do. I cannot get on the pitch and do anything about it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to take lots of responsibility for what\xe2\x80\x99s happened and players have to take it. Some of the players have taken that responsibility.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>With Barcelona losing 1-0 to M\xc3\xa1laga, top-of-the-table Chelsea drawing with Burnley, and Manchester United losing at Swansea, this was a perfect day for the champions. Now, they hope Tuesday will be the perfect evening.</p> <p>Man of the match Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 (Man City)</p>'
