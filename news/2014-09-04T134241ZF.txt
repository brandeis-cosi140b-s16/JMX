b'Falcao and the Monaco exodus: what\xe2\x80\x99s going on at last year\xe2\x80\x99s big spenders?'


b'<p>If only, as George W Bush might put it, the French had some way of saying volte-face. Or, as we can now say in English, \xe2\x80\x9cdoing an AS Monaco\xe2\x80\x9d. After all, this time last year the club from the principality were splashing out record sums in a bid to become an almost-instant European superpower; now they have decided to rein in their expenditure and cash out on top recruits such as James Rodr\xc3\xadguez and Radamel Falcao, leaving fans and onlookers angry about the abrupt change of direction.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere are two ways to go,\xe2\x80\x9d the Monaco vice-president Vadim Vasilyev says. \xe2\x80\x9cOne is either you invest a lot of money and do it quickly, the other is you build up an intelligent project and you have to base yourself on your academy and sound principles of working and scouting well and basically that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ve decided to do.\xe2\x80\x9d All very laudable, and all in total contrast to the approach that Vasilyev had initially pursued after being appointed last year by Dmitry Rybolovlev, the Russian billionaire who bought a controlling stake in Monaco in 2011 at a time when the seven-times champions of France were slumming it near the bottom of the country\xe2\x80\x99s second tier.</p> <p>After winning promotion last year, Monaco forked out around \xc2\xa3150m to attract two of the most sought-after players in the world, in Rodr\xc3\xadguez and Falcao, along with other coveted players such as Jo\xc3\xa3o Moutinho and the gifted young French midfielder Geoffrey Kondogbia. Huge salaries also lured Ricardo Carvalho and Eric Abidal on free transfers. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are ambitious, we are Monaco,\xe2\x80\x9d became the club\xe2\x80\x99s slogan, appearing on ubiquitous promotional material, usually accompanied by pictures of Rodr\xc3\xadguez and Falcao.</p> <p>Now both Colombians have left \xe2\x80\x93 Rodr\xc3\xadguez to Real Madrid for almost double the \xc2\xa339.5m that Monaco paid for him, and Falcao on loan to Manchester United. Factor in the departure of less glamorous personnel, such as the striker Emmanuel Rivi\xc3\xa8re to Newcastle, and 25 players (although this figure includes players from the academy and out of contract) have left the club this summer. Like-for-like replacements have been conspicuous by their absence so the club that spent around \xc2\xa3200m in the previous two years made a profit of about \xc2\xa370m on transfers this summer. Vasilyev, however, insists that he and Rybolovlev remain \xe2\x80\x9cstrongly committed\xe2\x80\x9d to Monaco and rejects suggestions that the Russians are flogging the club\xe2\x80\x99s top assets before pulling out.</p> <p>Such suggestions have become common in the French media. Indeed, a radical about-turn was almost expected from Rybolovlev in May after a Swiss court ordered him to pay a world-record divorce settlement of \xc2\xa32.7bn to his ex-wife, Elena. \xe2\x80\x9cMy responsibility is managing the club, I make it a principle not to discuss the private affairs of my president,\xe2\x80\x9d says Vasilyev when asked whether that ruling is behind Rybolovlev\xe2\x80\x99s reprioritising at Monaco. Other club sources, however, claim that the effect of the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision have been exaggerated, noting that several caveats in the ruling, plus what is expected to be a long appeal process, make it unlikely that Rybolovlev will ever have to pay anything close to the headline sum.</p> <p>Another theory floated by L\xe2\x80\x99Equipe this week is that Rybolovlev has watered down his investment in protest at Monaco not giving him a passport. The tycoon already holds a Cypriot one after living and investing heavily in that island but that document, unlike a Mon\xc3\xa9gasque one, would not grant anyone protection from extradition to Russia if, for some reason, such a scenario were ever to arise.</p> <p>Vasilyev, however, says that the club\xe2\x80\x99s change in policy is motivated by football reasons, particularly the hostility of European and French footballing authorities. He says that last year\xe2\x80\x99s splurge was a one-off intended to \xe2\x80\x9cjump-start\xe2\x80\x9d a newly promoted club so that they qualified for the Champions League at the first attempt, which they did, but he acknowledges that the original plan did not provide for quite such a sudden drop in investment.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cA few things happened in the meantime,\xe2\x80\x9d says Vasilyev. \xe2\x80\x9cThe most important of them was that this is the first year of the financial fair play rules \xe2\x80\xa6 Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain received quite severe sanctions, including fines, limits on recruitment and salary caps. I discussed this with my president and basically he said: \xe2\x80\x98Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m already investing big money and if the club has to pay fines over and on top of that, this is something that is really not on. This really goes against any common sense.\xe2\x80\x99 We had hoped that the sanctions would not be so severe and that clubs would be given a few years to adjust but it happened in a different way. I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying whether that\xe2\x80\x99s right or wrong, just that these are the rules and we have no other way but to comply with them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Another factor was the reaction of other French clubs to Monaco\xe2\x80\x99s extravagance, which, arriving at a time when most other clubs in Ligue 1 were locked in austerity drives, intensified resentment about Monaco\xe2\x80\x99s tax haven status. Ligue\xc2\xa01 threatened to kick the club out unless they moved their headquarters into the same tax jurisdiction as all the other clubs. Monaco, members of the French league since 1933 and never before the target of such threats, felt this was no moral stance, merely an opportunistic stick-up. After court disputes and mediation, the club eventuallyagreed to pay the league \xe2\x82\xac50m over two years to resolve the matter. But they were not happy about it and Vasilyev says that his employer might not have bought the club if he had known such a scenario would unfold.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis expenditure was not foreseen in our budget and was again on top of our investment,\xe2\x80\x9d says Vasilyev. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the club was bottom of the second league and fighting relegation to the third, no one was saying that this was a possibility, there was not a single hint of it. It was only after we were very close to going back to the top [that clubs began agitating]. Had this been known to [Rybolovlev] at the time he was taking over the club, he might have thought differently. He came in good faith, he started investing, which is not only good for the team, it is also good for French football. And then he is being punished.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>None of that turned Rybolovlev off French football, insists Vasilyev, but it did contribute to the change of policy, the decision to swiftly switch the focus to cultivating young talent. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a historic academy, this is where Thierry Henry, Emmanuel Petit, David Trezeguet and Lilian Thuram came from. Now we have eight academy players in our professional squad and that is really good. We really have a lot of talent and we now have a coach [Leonardo Jardim] who is really good at developing young talent. Just look at the things he has done in Sporting Lisbon with a team with no real stars and a lot of young boys.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Jardim, who inspired Sporting to a second-place finish in Portugal last season, was hired in the summer after Claudio Ranieri left Monaco. The former Chelsea manager was frustrated with the club\xe2\x80\x99s new policy. Vasilyev says it is \xe2\x80\x9crubbish\xe2\x80\x9d that many players now feel likewise, though admits that the 28-year-old Falcao was an exception. \xe2\x80\x9cI love my club and I think we have a great project but we have to admit that we are not yet on the level of Manchester United or Real Madrid,\xe2\x80\x9d says Vasilyev. \xe2\x80\x9cWe still need more time to develop and obviously a player like Falcao wants to have a project now and not tomorrow. I would presume that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t really have the time to wait. I would have liked him to stay but I can understand at his age.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The new policy has also enraged some supporters, with a group this week demanding that their tickets be refunded in the wake of the departures and media claims about Rybolovlev\xe2\x80\x99s motivations. Vasilyev says such dissenters form a minority. \xe2\x80\x9cWe deny strongly what was said by those few supporters,\xe2\x80\x9d says Vasilyev. \xe2\x80\x9cThe supporters are fully behind the club \xe2\x80\xa6 They are very happy that President Rybolovlev arrived at a very difficult moment has taken them back to the top. It is not a matter of two or three players, it is a project and they believe in it.\xe2\x80\x9d Vasilyev says Rybolovlev will not bankroll the recruitment of another Falcao \xe2\x80\x9cin the foreseeable future\xe2\x80\x9d but he does not accept that any plan to grow Monaco more organically is doomed to failure because of the club\xe2\x80\x99s small fan base. An average home gate of around 10,000 does not seem like especially fertile ground. \xe2\x80\x9cYou say we don\xe2\x80\x99t have many fans but this is a country of 35,000 people so having 10,000 in Monaco is like having maybe 300,000 in a stadium in Manchester if we take it proportionally, as we should. To always fill our stadium we would need everyone in the country to come, including new-borns and the elderly, so we have to be realistic. But the passion in there and the atmosphere is much better than it was before. This is a prestigious club with seven French titles and was in the Champions League final just 10 years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>If Monaco had continued on Rybolovlev\xe2\x80\x99s initial policy, they might have been among the favourites to challenge for the Champions League this season. Instead they face a struggle getting out of a group that includes Benfica, Zenit St Petersburg and Bayer Leverkusen. Finishing in the top three of Ligue 1 to qualify for the tournament again next term also looks a stern challenge, as they lie 15th after winning one of their first four matches. The club\xe2\x80\x99s goal is still to become a major international force on the back of being \xe2\x80\x9can upscale, luxury brand\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure it\xe2\x80\x99s possible but it will be a longer process,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are lucky to be in Monaco and have everything that this country stands for. It will be a longer journey than we thought but I am confident we will get there. We are evaluating how long but obviously it will take at least five years.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
