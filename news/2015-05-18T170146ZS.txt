b'<p>Sky Sports will televise three live games simultaneously on Sunday as the battle to avoid relegation from the Premier League takes top billing.</p> <p>Hull City, Newcastle United and Sunderland all go into the weekend with the possibility of demotion to the Championship and, with the race for the title and Champions League places sewn up, the focus is on the bottom of the table.</p> <p>Sky will broadcast live from the KC Stadium as Hull take on Manchester United, from Stamford Bridge as Chelsea play host to the Black Cats while Newcastle face West Ham at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park.</p> <p>With all the games kicking off at 3pm, the drama will evoke memories of famous final-day escapes such as Everton\xe2\x80\x99s in 1994 and, in 2005, when West Brom famously became the first team to avoid the drop despite being bottom at Christmas.</p> <p>While viewers will have the choice between the three matches, they will also be given live updates and goal replays from the other matches.</p>'
