b'Could Christoph Kramer\xe2\x80\x99s freak own goal be the lift that Dortmund need? | Raphael Honigstein'


b"<p>Helmut Winklhofer can sleep a little easier now. For nearly 30 years, the former Bayern Munich midfielder has been synonymous with the most famous own goal in Bundesliga history. Achtung, nominative determinism, baby: no one\xe2\x80\x99s ever quite managed to hoof the ball into their own Winkel (German for \xe2\x80\x9ctop corner of the goal\xe2\x80\x9d) from 30 metres out with so much aplomb before or since. Until Sunday night at the Signal Iduna Park, that is.</p> <p>The Gladbach midfielder Christoph Kramer received the ball with his back to goal and passed it on again \xe2\x80\xa6 a little too forcefully and casually chipped his keeper Yann Sommer from 45 metres in the process. It was the most fantastic autogol \xe2\x80\x93 as our Italian cousins call this regrettable act of footballistical self-penetration \xe2\x80\x93 you\xe2\x80\x99ll see this season and for many years to come. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought the ball was bouncing up a bit\xe2\x80\x9d, the 23-year-old tried to explain later, \xe2\x80\x9cbut as soon as I hit it, I thought: \xe2\x80\x98Oh shit.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed. BVB\xe2\x80\x99s veteran Sebastian Kehl was the first to console the World Cup winner, others followed. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s an extraordinary player, this will be nothing more than a curious footnote in his career,\xe2\x80\x9d said J\xc3\xbcrgen Klopp.</p> <p>Like Winklhofer before him in August 1985, Kramer is unlikely to escape the ignominy of being named November\xe2\x80\x99s goalscorer of the month. Winklhofer refused to receive his medal in the Sportschau studio \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cThey want to take the piss\xe2\x80\x9d, Uli Hoeness, Bayern\xe2\x80\x99s then general manager, thundered \xe2\x80\x93 but Kramer will probably play along gamely, lovely boy that he is. \xe2\x80\x9cThat can happen, it\xe2\x80\x99s only human,\xe2\x80\x9d he winced after the final whistle.</p> <p>Kramer, you will recall (pun intended), was the Germany player who had to be replaced with concussion in Rio de Janeiro, having asked the referee whether it really was the World Cup final that he was playing in. This time, however, he knew exactly where he was and what he was doing. \xe2\x80\x9cI have to apologise to my team-mates but I\xe2\x80\x99m angrier about playing 90 minutes of crap,\xe2\x80\x9d he told reporters. \xe2\x80\x9cThat mustn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.\xe2\x80\x9d By way of mitigation, the whole Gladbach team had actually forgotten to turn up; one measly effort in front of Roman Weidenfeller was all that Lucien Favre\xe2\x80\x99s lame Foals could muster against the far superior black and yellow Borussia. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a well-deserved win for Dortmund,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted the Swiss coach.</p> <p>Gladbach will live with their first defeat in 19 games (in all competitions) even if they could easily have extended their record run in this game. Because, though Dortmund played their best football of the season in the first half, they had nothing to show for it after Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Marco Reus missed the best chances. It took Kramer going rogue to break the deadlock in the 58th minute.</p>            <p>Klopp later claimed that his men had been \xe2\x80\x9ctoo good\xe2\x80\x9d to suffer another disappointing result after five league defeats in a row. But stranger things have happened this season. Maybe it needed such a freak goal to end such a freak run. \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t experienced the feeling of winning a game for such a long time, I hardly find the words now,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Dortmund coach. \xe2\x80\x9cAt last we are in double figures, points-wise. The team has done extraordinary well, considering the situation we were in.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Dortmund had started the day at rock-bottom, in 18th place. But they held their nerve and channelled their frustration into a gutsy, passionate show. There were euphoric scenes at the final whistle. It felt as if Klopp had just won the biggest game of his career. And maybe he has.</p> <p>The win proved, for the time being, his theory that there is nothing really wrong with his team\xe2\x80\x99s football, earlier results notwithstanding. Now that they\xe2\x80\x99ve become the first side to defeat Gladbach, who are probably the most tactically coherent side in Germany, they can certainly breathe a lot easier during the international break. They\xe2\x80\x99re 15th, and only nine points behind fourth-placed Hannover, the latest surprise team to occupy a lofty position. It should only be a matter of repeating the trick \xe2\x80\x93 minus help from Kramer \xe2\x80\x93 over the next few weeks to end 2014 on a reasonable note.</p> Talking points <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 VfB Stuttgart, 2-0 losers at Werder Bremen, are bottom of the table. The Swabians\xe2\x80\x99 descent into relegation zone hell is symbolic of the collapse of the Bundesliga\xe2\x80\x99s old class system. All the smaller clubs are so good - or the traditional outfits so poor - that there is only a tiny elite (Bayern, Gladbach, Wolfsburg, Leverkusen and yes: Dortmund) and the rest of the rabble this season. No middle ground. No middle class. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are fighting against the drop,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted VfB\xe2\x80\x99s captain Christian Gentner after the defeat at the Weserstadion. Their coach Armin Veh bemoaned his side conceding yet again from dead-ball situations - \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s the ninth time in 11 games, that drives me crazy\xe2\x80\x9d - and incompetent defending all around. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost as if there\xe2\x80\x99s no proper coaching. Veh, a genial character, is one of these managers who can manage dressing rooms well but leave most of the practical decisions on the pitch to their players. If those are clever, experienced and organised enough, his teams tend to thrive. If they\xe2\x80\x99re lacking in those departments, however, the hands-off Veh is often unable to stop the rot. Similarities with a prominent, winter coat-wearing Premier League figure might not be purely coincidental here.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\x9cIt feels good but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the happiness will last until Christmas\xe2\x80\x9d, shrugged Thomas M\xc3\xbcller after his hat-trick in Bayern\xe2\x80\x99s 4-0 win at Frankfurt. The visitors had a pretty tough time at the beginning, as Eintracht surprised them with their very aggressive stance (\xe2\x80\x9cmuch more fun than playing against teams who defend with 15 men and park the bus,\xe2\x80\x9d said M\xc3\xbcller). But the league leaders never looked like conceding. J\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xb4me Boateng set a new record in going through 50 league games undefeated and the keeper Manuel Neuer had enough time on his hands to almost steal M\xc3\xbcller\xe2\x80\x99s thunder with a fine flick of pass that was perhaps designed to sway impressionable voters for the Ballon D\xe2\x80\x99Or.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Qualification for the Champions League remains Schalke\xe2\x80\x99s official goal of the campaign but they, too, might have to reconsider soon. One month into his reign at the Royal Blues, Roberto Di Matteo has faithfully replicated the pattern of inconsistent performances set by his predecessor Jens Keller. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will be off the pace for the whole season,\xe2\x80\x9d warned the former Chelsea midfielder and manager after the 2-0 defeat at Freiburg, in reference to an alleged fitness deficit. That don\xe2\x80\x99t sound good at all. Blaming the old coach for your problems is a fine tradition in the Bundesliga but you can\xe2\x80\x99t use that line for too long. The sporting director Horst Heldt has already put some distance between himself and his latest recruit by stating, rather ominously, that there was \xe2\x80\x9cno structure\xe2\x80\x9d on the pitch. </p> <p>Results: Hertha 0\xe2\x80\x932 Hannover, Freiburg 2-0 Schalke, Bremen 2-0 Stuttgart, Augsburg 3-0 Paderborn, Hoffenheim 3-4 K\xc3\xb6ln, Leverkusen 0-0 Mainz, Frankfurt 0-4 Bayern, Wolfsburg 2-0 HSV, Dortmund 1\xe2\x80\x930 Gladbach.</p>      Pos Team P GD Pts      1 Bayern Munich 11 24 27    2 Wolfsburg 11 13 23    3 Borussia M'gladbach 11 9 20    4 Hannover 96 11 -2 19    5 TSG Hoffenheim 11 3 17    6 Bayer Leverkusen 11 2 17    7 Augsburg 11 2 15    8 Mainz 11 1 15    9 Paderborn 11 0 15    10 Cologne 11 0 15    11 Schalke 04 11 -1 14    12 Eintracht Frankfurt 11 -6 12    13 SC Freiburg 11 -3 11    14 Hertha Berlin 11 -6 11    15 Borussia Dortmund 11 -5 10    16 Werder Bremen 11 -10 10    17 Hamburg 11 -10 9    18 VfB Stuttgart 11 -11 9     "
