b'<p>MORE THAN A CLIPPING ABOUT KLOPP</p> <p>Managerial announcements from Germany did not always get that much space in Big Paper back in the day. When Franz Beckenbauer took charge of the West German national team in 1984, for example, the subject was only broached in the sixth paragraph of a general football roundup. To be fair, the first five paragraphs were about Diego Maradona moving from Barcelona to Napoli in a reported world-record $7.5m deal, and people generally didn\xe2\x80\x99t obsess about football in the middle of July back then, so we\xe2\x80\x99re not exactly sure what we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to say here. But whichever way you spin it, a story about one of the greatest players to ever play the game taking over one of the most successful international teams of all time was squirrelled away in the middle of page 18.</p> <p>Compare and contrast to the amount of space given over to this morning\xe2\x80\x99s announcement by J\xc3\xbcrgen Klopp that he\xe2\x80\x99s a bit bored now, and has decided to leave Borussia Dortmund at the end of the season. The lead story all morning on Big Electronic Paper, that was, and one that highlights the difference between the innocent past, when the movements of Beckenbauer and Maradona were a mere afterthought, and these more enlightened, cosmopolitan times, when everyone talks of the groundbreaking way \xe2\x80\x9cKloppo\xe2\x80\x9d deployed his full-backs away at Arminia Bielefeld in 2009, despite having only watched \xe2\x80\x9cder BVB\xe2\x80\x9d twice in their lives \xe2\x80\x93 and one of those occasions was when they sat on the remote and accidentally activated the Sky red button during a Chelsea game.</p> <p>Klopp instantly becomes a hot property, having led Dortumund to a Big Cup final as well as winning two Bundesliga title races none of us paid any attention to at the time, no matter how much we like to now pretend otherwise. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not tired,\xe2\x80\x9d began his transparent come-and-get-me plea today. \xe2\x80\x9cI may look tired but I am not. I am 0.0% tired.\xe2\x80\x9d Fans of the pulseless art of data crunching will have worked out that Klopp is raring to start again somewhere else, but for the rest of us who don\xe2\x80\x99t squint at Excel documents all day in the futile hope of finding some meaning in our empty lives, he added for the purposes of clarification: \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t had any contact with any other clubs but am not planning a sabbatical.\xe2\x80\x9d Cue excitable gossip linking Klopp to Manchester City, Arsenal, and Liverpool if they don\xe2\x80\x99t win the cup, which they won\xe2\x80\x99t, before he ends up at Real Madrid.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Scott Murray from 7.45pm BST for MBM coverage of PSG 1-2 Barcelona, while John Ashdown will be in the hot seat for Porto 1-1 Bayern Munich.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY      <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy mum said to me two days after the fire: \xe2\x80\x98Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re here for a reason.\xe2\x80\x99 Well, maybe the reason I am here is to \xe2\x80\x93 finally \xe2\x80\x93 reveal the truth, not only for my own family but for the families of all the people who died around me. Everything I have found was available on public records in 1985 and should have been resolved while I was still in my teens, if not before. I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be sat here at 42 saying what has been on public record since 1985 and unaddressed for 30 years. What I find amazing is that but for my survival none of this would have ever come to light. People would never have known. It\xe2\x80\x99s a failure of a rule of law in this country. For it to be a left to a 12-year-old survivor to get to 27, wanting to prove his mother wrong and give her peace of mind, and for him to lose the next 15 years of his life \xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it says about the UK, or the system we live within, but it is the ultimate indictment because it is not my duty. It should not be my role. But it has been left to me\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Martin Fletcher tells Daniel Taylor about his 15-year investigation into Stafford Heginbotham, the former Bradford City chairman who is linked to at least eight other fires before the Valley Parade disaster, in which 56 fans lost their lives, four of them members of Fletcher\xe2\x80\x99s family. And here is the first serialised extract of his book. Part two tomorrow.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI see Raheem Sterling is alleged to have taken nitrous oxide, or \xe2\x80\x98laughing gas\xe2\x80\x99 as it\xe2\x80\x99s known on the street (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Bits and Bobs). I am outraged, outraged and appalled. I demand he be figuratively lynched, if not literally. Britain deserves an inquiry too, an enormous, portentous public inquiry that will cost a fortune, lead to nothing and achieve less (they\xe2\x80\x99re the best ones). Surely someone, somewhere should be far more outraged than the next over this damning and senseless abuse of a fairly benign balloon full of dentist\xe2\x80\x99s gas. Maybe even, if it\xe2\x80\x99s a slow news week, the morning shows could bang on about it endlessly, or at least until another young lad, barely out of his teens does something else a bit daft. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like in my day, we never did drugs, we made do with good clean fun, 12 pints of snakebite and 20 Rothmans every Friday night never did me any harm(ish)\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Marten Allen.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver makes mention of Blackpool\xe2\x80\x99s defeat to Rotherham last week when the directors\xe2\x80\x99 box was pelted with eggs. A quick search of the results shows that Blackpool drew 1-1 at home to Rotherham in December. I\xe2\x80\x99ve just bought 24 rotten ones and am heading to Fiver Towers to lob them at your windows owing to your massive incompetence\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Mark Ridley (and 1,056 other, quite right, egg-throwers).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOn learning of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters winner, I sighed and concluded: wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be good to be in his shoes\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Tom Deering (and 1,056 others).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHave Sky reinvented football again?
