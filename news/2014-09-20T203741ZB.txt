b'<p>Brendan Rodgers has admitted Liverpool \xe2\x80\x9ccannot even entertain talk\xe2\x80\x9d of mounting a title challenge again until they recover their poise, with last season\xe2\x80\x99s runners-up having endured a third damaging defeat in their first five games for only the second time since the top flight was revamped as the Premier League</p> <p>The visitors were overrun by two early goals from a vibrant West Ham United early on at the Boleyn Ground and, once they had gathered some late momentum, were caught on the break by Morgan Amalfitano\xe2\x80\x99s third. The loss was suffered with six senior players \xe2\x80\x93 most notably Daniel Sturridge and Glen Johnson \xe2\x80\x93 currently injured, but Rodgers admitted his players had fallen below the standards set last term in slipping to a second successive league defeat.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe were nowhere near the standard,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLots of elements of our game have been very good in the last few seasons, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not quite happening for us at the moment. We have a lot of work to do, but that was disappointing. We showed our potential in the Tottenham Hotspur game [won 3-0] when we had key players fit, and showed the quality and intensity of the team. But, even with those guys out, we should still be better than we were today.</p>     Steven Gerrard leads his Liverpool team off the field after the game.

It\xe2\x80\x99s a club people want to beat, but we\xe2\x80\x99re even more so now we\xe2\x80\x99re in the Champions League. It\xe2\x80\x99s something we need to deal with. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always said we\xe2\x80\x99re a work in progress \xe2\x80\x93 we probably arrived early last year \xe2\x80\x93 and people will look at Chelsea and Manchester City as the two squads set up for the title race, but there are no limits to what we want to achieve at Liverpool.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe just want to keep moving forward. But we\xe2\x80\x99ve lost three of our last five, so we can\xe2\x80\x99t even entertain talk of that until we get some sort of consistency. We have to get back to what we were doing in the Spurs game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Brendan Rodgers watches his side at Upton Park.

They are still striving to adjust to new surroundings, though there is little time available for them to find their feet. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to deal with the expectation,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Liverpool manager, who will welcome Everton to Anfield on Saturday \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t run away from it. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anywhere near what I\xe2\x80\x99d expect, and that intensity just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there in our game. So we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to try and get better.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
