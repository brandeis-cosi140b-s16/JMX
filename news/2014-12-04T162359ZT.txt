b'THE ERRORS ARE INTENTIONAL <p>Sometimes doing something in a rush is unavoidable. Like this, for instance. This has to be written in around 0.000000002 seconds, while the Fiver balances a set of dinner plates on its head and attempts to power the entire building by pounding the pedals that have been inserted under its desk, which explains all the speling misteaks and glaring factual errors about Gerald Francis\xe2\x80\x99s Tottenham Hotspurs ending their dismal run against Chelsee by beating Claudio Ranieri\xe2\x80\x99s struggling Blues at London Bridge \xe2\x80\x93 or was it Stamford Hill? - last night thanks to a first-half hat-trick from Andy Townsend and an additional goal strike from Tore Andre Flo. Don\xe2\x80\x99t complain, we are in a hurry and it\xe2\x80\x99s not like you ingrates have paid for all this free wrong stuff. Unless you have \xe2\x80\x93 in which case, apologies, won\xe2\x80\x99t happen again.</p> <p>But it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always have to be that way. Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s nice to take your time, take stock, relax, have a chill pill, just go with the flow. Yes, Southampton, a football team, lost a football match in unfortunate fashion at Arsenal last night. It was their second successive defeat after they were crammed into a small box by Manchester City on Sunday and they\xe2\x80\x99ve been hit by a load of injuries before they play Manchester United next. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be the crisis some people want it to be. Sometimes losing can just be A Thing That Happens To Football Teams, nothing to get too worked up over. Just as Southampton weren\xe2\x80\x99t about to win the league after their fine start to the season, nor are they about to plummet to the bottom after losing a couple of games to two of the best sides in the country, and anyway they only cracked because they finished the game with 10 men after Toby Alderweireld limped off with a hamstring injury. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was really sh!t,\xe2\x80\x9d the Belgian defender said, using big boy language in a way that should hopefully lead to a four-month investigation by the Football Association into his conduct.</p> <p>Alderweireld\xe2\x80\x99s assessment was also an accurate description of Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s performance at Stamford Bridge. Sorry to disappoint any excited Spurs fans who read the first paragraph and thought that they had finally ended their Chelsea hoodoo but that didn\xe2\x80\x99t really happen. It was a joke, a construct, a comedy turn, a little bit of banter \xe2\x80\x93 Andy Townsend doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even play for Tottenham! Instead Mauricio Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s men were left with a familiar feeling after being tossed aside by the evergreen Didier Drogba, Chelsea waltzing to a comfortable 3-0 victory that keeps them six points in front of Manchester City, who took their time to get going against Sunderland before running out 4-1 winners thanks to Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero\xe2\x80\x99s masterclass. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t be champions in December, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got six months more to try to be champions again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini, before switching the lights out and going back to bed. \xe2\x80\x9cWake me up in May, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see where we are then,\xe2\x80\x9d he didn\xe2\x80\x99t add.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere will be an agreement that if there is no progress I will step down\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Former Dynamo Kiev midfielder Alexander Khatskevich roars into his new job as manager of Belarus with a battle cry of which Henry V would\xe2\x80\x99ve been proud.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel.

In the second paragraph of my least favorite late morning (US Central Time) email, The Fiver refers to \xe2\x80\x98the Big Cup\xe2\x80\x99 when discussing the relative merits of Stevie Mbe and his contract offer. As a half-heartedly interested, occasional reader of The Fiver, I know that both Big Cup and Big Vase/Euro Vase are to be referred to without the article, and expect an immediate return to the consistent inconsistency of composition which I have come to expect, sometimes\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Matias Pasch (and no others)</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI notice Emmanuel Petit chose the example of Wayne Rooney, not David Beckham, or Paul Gascoigne, or George Best, or Mario Balotelli, or every England manager of the past 50 years, to show the French that the English media treat their football heroes better\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Jordan Glossop.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve just started reading the Fiver again. It\xe2\x80\x99s still not funny\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Graham Quick</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And if you\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing better to do you can also tweet the Fiver. Today\xe2\x80\x99s winner of our letter o\xe2\x80\x99the day is: Matias Pasch, who wins a copy of Football Manager 2015, courtesy of the very kind people at Football Manager Towers.
