b'The Guardian\xe2\x80\x99s predictions for the new Premier League season | Guardian staff'


b'<p>Daniel Taylor</p> <p>Title winners: The Community Shield felt like a deception. Manchester City get my vote because they have more firepower than Chelsea. Arsenal could be light defensively whereas Manchester United have too much ground to make up and Liverpool, without Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez, no longer look so formidable.</p> <p>Relegated: Crystal Palace are back in turmoil after Tony Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s exit. West Brom do not score enough goals and Burnley might be a yo-yo club.</p> <p>Player of the season: Robin van Persie. Ask David Moyes and he will maintain he never had an issue with Van Persie. Yet the striker was strangely dislocated after Sir Alex Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s retirement. Louis van Gaal can re-invigorate him.</p> <p>Surprise of the season: Leicester City won 31 games in the Championship last season to finish on 102 points. They should not be afraid of making the step up.</p> <p>Signing of the season: Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho looked like he might spontaneously combust last season because of the poor return from Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s strikers. Costa played with enough distinction at Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid to create the sense he can score the goals to remove the problem.</p> <p>Young player of the season: John Stones. There is a feeling among the people who have worked with Stones that he still needs toughening up and might struggle against an old-fashioned centre-forward. He does, however, have brilliant potential.</p> <p>Least excited about: The disruption caused by uninspiring internationals just as the season is trying to get some momentum. This year: two-week breaks for the new-look, bloated Euro 2016, in September, October and November, in what threatens to be the most boring qualification process in memory.</p> <p>Most excited about: Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s press conferences: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen journalists ask dumb questions I mercilessly attack them,\xe2\x80\x9d Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s new manager once said. When one reporter fell into the trap, Van Gaal was true to his word. \xe2\x80\x9cAre you really that dumb, or am I so clever?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Dominic Fifield</p> <p>Title winners: Chelsea have bought well with Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho declaring this is now \xe2\x80\x98his\xe2\x80\x99 squad. Greater goal threat should see them avoid some of the costly slip ups which left them third last time round.</p> <p>Relegated: Burnley were excellent last season but surviving on limited resources may be beyond even Sean Dyche. Leicester need to retain faith in Nigel Pearson, while could any club survive summer sales as brutal as Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s?</p> <p>Player of the season: Eden Hazard</p> <p>If Chelsea are to claim Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s third Premier League title then surely the Belgian must flourish consistently, most probably as a No10 in a revitalised lineup.</p> <p>Surprise of the season: It will be intriguing to see whether Queens Park Rangers, with Harry Redknapp forever scouring the market, have really learned their lessons from last time\xe2\x80\x99s two-year sojourn in the elite.</p> <p>Young player of the season: John Stones</p> <p>He made an impact last term but could find himself a regular for club and country in the campaign ahead.</p> <p>Signing of the season: Gylfi Sigurdsson has rejoined Swansea hoping to supply the goal threat lost through Michu\xe2\x80\x99s sale. He was the makeweight in a swap deal, but could prove to be a bargain.</p> <p>Least excited about: That tussle petering out into a two-way slug for the title between Chelsea and Manchester City. The longer the others remain in contention, the better.</p> <p>Most excited about: The seven-club dispute for a Champions League qualification place with Manchester United, under Louis van Gaal, sure to be more threatening than last term.</p> <p>Barney Ronay</p> <p>Title winners: Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has taken a punt or two - nobody, not even Diego Costa, knows how good Diego Costa really is - but Cesc F\xc3\xa1bregas could be a fine signing and if he\xe2\x80\x99s not there\xe2\x80\x99s a wealth of alternative midfield riches.</p> <p>Relegated: QPR, Leicester City and West Brom, the first two simply because teams that come up tend to go down, the last because \xe2\x80\xa6 well, it all looks a bit iffy.</p> <p>Player of the season: Raheem Sterling</p> <p>Slick in pre-season and even managed to have a decent-ish World Cup. Best young English player around: his progress will be fascinating.</p> <p>Surprise of the season: Burnley to stay in the Premier League after a thrusting start, a mid-season collapse and a dramatic last-ditch escape that ends with a shirtless, tear-stained Sean Dyche individually hugging every single member of the home crowd in the centre circle.</p> <p>Signing of the season: Emre Can</p> <p>Exactly the kind of intelligent, astute, all-round midfielder English football doesn\xe2\x80\x99t produce and the right man at the right club [Liverpool] this season.</p> <p>Young player of the season: James Wilson looks like a natural and young players are part of the Van Gaal schtick. Give him a run, Louis.</p> <p>Least excited about: The usual soap opera, personality, inflammatory quotes, so-called mind so-called games, feuds, strops, handshakes and so on that somehow appear in the eyeline just as there\xe2\x80\x99s some actual football happening.</p> <p>Most excited about: Van Gaal versus Mourinho/Wenger/Koeman/Pulis/the entire English press/Gary Lineker on Match of the Day/anyone else who knows him.</p> <p>Paul Wilson</p> <p>Title winners: Chelsea</p> <p>They have strengthened over the summer and beat Manchester City home and away last season. Liverpool and City to be distracted by Europe, United could be Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s biggest threat.</p> <p>Relegated: Crystal Palace, QPR and Burnley. I think Sean Dyche\xe2\x80\x99s team will be competitive, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure the club is setting itself up for an extended run in the top division.</p> <p>Player of the season: Cesc F\xc3\xa1bregas</p> <p>Unless Diego Costa really hits the ground running. Probably (hopefully) not Didier Drogba.</p> <p>Surprise of the season: Sunderland to challenge for a Champions League place. No I don\xe2\x80\x99t quite see it either, but it would be a surprise.</p> <p>Signing of the season: Jordi G\xc3\xb3mez</p> <p>Based on the above it ought to be F\xc3\xa1bregas, Costa, or Drogba. So let\xe2\x80\x99s go instead for Jordi G\xc3\xb3mez, who will help Sunderland surprise everyone.</p> <p>Young player of the season: John Stones is ready to have a big season for Everton.</p> <p>Least excited about: Louis van Gaal sorting Manchester United out. If he succeeds his condescension might be unbearable.</p> <p>Most excited about: Roy Keane sorting Aston Villa out. Someone needs to.</p> <p>Andy Hunter</p> <p>Title winners: Manchester City</p> <p>City\xe2\x80\x99s commitment was questionable during their last title defence under Roberto Mancini but, providing the attitude is right and Eliaquim Mangala improves the defence, they represent the most formidable unit.</p> <p>Relegated: Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and Burnley. Villa have flirted with trouble for too long and Joe Cole, Philippe Senderos and Aly Cissokho are no rescue act. Tony Pulis\xe2\x80\x99 exit represents a seismic blow to Crystal Palace, and the second season can be difficult enough for promoted teams without untimely instability, while Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s lack of depth may ultimately cost them.</p> <p>Player of the season: Nemanja Matic</p> <p>The Serbian obviously has no chance of winning the award \xe2\x80\x93 unfussy defensive midfielders never do \xe2\x80\x93 but will have a major influence on whether Chelsea can wrestle the title from City.</p> <p>Surprise of the season: Stoke City. 50 points and a ninth place finish represented an encouraging return from Mark Hughes\xe2\x80\x99s first season in charge and with Premier League experience plus forwards added this summer, Stoke could push on.</p> <p>Young player of the season: Raheem Sterling</p> <p>Seems strange opting for a veteran of 77 games and 12 goals for Liverpool but he is still only 19 and improving rapidly.</p> <p>Signing of the season: Enner Valencia</p> <p>Yes, a choice made entirely on the basis of his good World Cup with Ecuador (plus it\xe2\x80\x99s been an underwhelming transfer window) but he can, for better or worse, shape West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s season.</p> <p>Least excited about: Managers/players blaming the World Cup for poor results/form. Especially if they\xe2\x80\x99re English.</p> <p>Most excited about: \xe2\x80\x98Most intrigued by\xe2\x80\x99 would be a more accurate description for this \xe2\x80\x93 Liverpool after Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez.</p> <p>Stuart James</p> <p>Title winners: Manchester City</p> <p>Still think the champions boast the strongest squad, even if it has been a quiet summer in the transfer market by their standards. Expect Chelsea to run them close. United third.</p> <p>Relegated: Leicester, Burnley and Southampton. Sorry to be predictable and suggest two of the promoted trio will struggle. As for Palace, the departure of Pulis feels like a huge blow to their prospects.</p> <p>Player of the season: Aaron Ramsey</p> <p>On the basis that only injury robbed him of the chance to be this player last season.</p> <p>Surprise of the season: What a struggle this category is... I don\xe2\x80\x99t see anyone new breaking into last season\xe2\x80\x99s top seven. Lower down, Swansea may do better than expected. Ditto QPR.</p> <p>Signing of the season: Ander Herrera</p> <p>Bafetimbi Gomis, on a free from Lyon, could do well for Swansea, but I\xe2\x80\x99m plumping for Herrera, Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa328m recruit from Athletic Bilbao.</p> <p>Young player of the season: Bojan Krkic Is 23 young? If so, all eyes on Bojan Krkic. Fascinating to see whether the former Barcelona prodigy can revive his career at Stoke.</p> <p>Least excited about: Negotiating the roadworks on the M5.</p> <p>Most excited about: Seeing how quickly Louis van Gaal can transform United and whether he rattles Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s cage.</p> <p>Jamie Jackson</p> <p>Title winners: Chelsea</p> <p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has solved the problem of no big-game striker by signing Atletico Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s Diego Costa and, having won nothing in his first season back, will be desperate to do so.</p> <p>Relegated: Southampton, due to the ongoing player exodus from the club. Of the three promoted teams Harry Redknapp\xe2\x80\x99s nous should allow Queens Park Rangers to survive so Leicester City and Burnley are my other two choices.</p> <p>Player of the season: Cesc F\xc3\xa1bregas</p> <p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho loves a goalscoring up-and-down midfielder and with the Spaniard replacing Frank Lampard as the Portuguese\xe2\x80\x99s go-to man, F\xc3\xa1bregas could dazzle the Premier League again.</p> <p>Surprise of the season: Manchester United. Louis van Gaal is expected to claim a fourth-placed finish, at least. But needing two top-class central defenders and a central midfielder the 20-times champions could struggle unless these are recruited.</p> <p>Signing of the season: Willy Caballero</p> <p>Manuel Pellegrini has bought him to offer serious competition to Joe Hart so how this rivalry develops should fascinate.</p> <p>Young player of the season: Luke Shaw</p> <p>Shaw, 19, was described as not fit enough by Van Gaal, having arrived as United\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa327m, \xc2\xa3100,000 a-week first choice left-back. Now he has to learn a fresh 5-2-1-2 system and an unfamiliar wingback role.</p> <p>Least excited about </p> <p>Managers stating referees have a difficult job \xe2\x80\x93 they do \xe2\x80\x93 then claiming the men in black should never be criticised, then doing precisely so, week in, week out.</p> <p>Most excited about</p> <p>Every part of the whole Premier League cabaret, especially how Van Gaal works out as United manager once the going gets particularly tough.</p> <p>Louise Taylor</p> <p>Title winners: Liverpool</p> <p>Yes, they\xe2\x80\x99ve lost Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez but they look a stronger team than during last season\xe2\x80\x99s near miss. The new signings look good, the philosophy\xe2\x80\x99s great and Brendan Rodgers is arguably the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s best manager.</p> <p>Relegated: QPR, Leicester, West Brom </p> <p>Alan Irvine\xe2\x80\x99s wildcard appointment represents a real risk on West Brom\xe2\x80\x99s part. Nigel Pearson and Leicester don\xe2\x80\x99t look strong enough. Harry Redknapp\xe2\x80\x99s was fortunate to win promotion and his luck might be about to run out. Providing, of course, Sean Dyche keeps Burnley up by the skin of his teeth.</p> <p>Player of the season: Robin van Persie</p> <p>Louis van Gaal should re-awaken a striker who spent far too much of last season sulking. Struggled in the World Cup but there is truth in the old cliche about form being temporary but class permanent.</p> <p>Surprise of the season: Newcastle United</p> <p>Sure, Alan Pardew is under immense pressure but he\xe2\x80\x99s often at his best when cornered - and Remy Cabella, Siem de Jong and company look strong signings. Newcastle United might just gatecrash the Champions League party. Either that or flirt with relegation...</p> <p>Signing of the season: Jack Rodwell</p> <p>Providing he can stay fit and keep those hamstrings in premium condition. The sort of top quality midfield workhorse Sunderland have long craved. Capable of propelling Gus Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s side into the top 10 - and forcing himself back into the England squad.</p> <p>Young player of the season: Rolando Aarons</p> <p>Swashbuckling, swaggering young Newcastle creator who looks capable of switching the lights on at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park. Sends frissons of excitement through crowds when he touches the ball. The brightest of breakthrough summers has seen promotion to the first team squad. In contention to start against Manchester City on Sunday.</p> <p>Least excited about</p> <p>The never-ending steps to Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s press box - by far the highest in the Premier League - and Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s policy of offering newspapers minimal access to Alan Pardew and the players.</p> <p>Most excited about</p> <p>A north-east season which fails to feature a relegation dalliance and, perhaps, even a cup win. Well, we can live in hope.</p> <p>Paul Doyle</p> <p>Title winners: Manchester City to edge out Chelsea thanks to superior striking options, unless that changes between now and the closure of the transfer window.</p> <p>Relegated</p> <p>Aston Villa\xe2\x80\x99s curt motto - \xe2\x80\x9cPrepared\xe2\x80\x9d - seems inapposite given their current state and, as their new assistant manager is fond of saying, if you fail to prepare, you prepare to fail. Burnley were brilliant last season but do not look to have enough strength in depth to survive. Leicester seem to lack enough quality too.</p> <p>Player of the season: Aaron Ramsey</p> <p>He might have won it last season if not for injury and he looks set to be the inventive hub of an Arsenal midfield that should be wonderful to watch going forward.</p> <p>Surprise of the season: Would Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho leaving Stamford Bridge by the end of the season count as a surprise? How about Stoke finishing eighth? West Brom staying up?</p> <p>Signing of the season: Muhamed Besic</p> <p>Is 21 still young? Good. Then Besic is your man. Elegant of foot, dynamic and even explosive of disposition, this midfielder could prove a marvellous signing by Everton.</p> <p>Young player of the season: Bojan Krkic</p> <p>There are some phrases you expect to never hear \xe2\x80\x93 such as Judas Priest at the Proms, or Prince Charles at work \xe2\x80\x93 and Krkic at Stoke would have been right up there until Mark Hughes began his steady evolution of the club. It will be fascinating to see what happens there next.</p> <p>Least excited about</p> <p>Rampant Louis Van Gaal worship, although it could have the upside of irritating Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho even more.</p> <p>Most excited about</p> <p>Hull in Europe; Raheem Sterling continuing to expand his impressive repertoire (alongside Philippe Coutinho and Adam Lallana); and Mauricio Pochettino giving Tottenham Hotspur an actual method, and an entertaining one to boot.</p> <p>Jacob Steinberg</p> <p>Title winners: Manchester City</p> <p>As long as Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero\xe2\x80\x99s dodgy hamstrings don\xe2\x80\x99t let him down, Manchester City should succeed where they failed two seasons ago and retain the title. They have the best squad.</p> <p>Relegated</p> <p>West Brom look iffy, Aston Villa worry me and Burnley don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough. And a bonus track: it could get ugly - well, uglier - at West Ham if Sam Allardyce goes.</p> <p>Player of the season: Aaron Ramsey</p> <p>Assuming Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant Welshman can avoid injury this time.</p> <p>Surprise of the season:</p> <p>How about Stoke? Mark Hughes improved their style of play hugely last season and they have had a settled summer.</p> <p>Signing of the season: Bojan Krkic</p> <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s doubtful he\xe2\x80\x99ll make them win anything but can the undoubtedly talented Krkic revive his career at Stoke?</p> <p>Young player of the season: James Wilson</p> <p>His opportunities will be limited but it looks like the Manchester United player is a finisher.</p> <p>Least excited about</p> <p>People failing to work out that Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho is winding them up.</p> <p>Most excited about</p> <p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho winding people up.</p>'
