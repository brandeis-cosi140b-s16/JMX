b'Football transfer rumours: Manuel Pellegrini to get fired by Man City?'


b'<p>\xe2\x80\x9cI am not talking about my position. It is not important,\xe2\x80\x9d said Manuel Pellegrini after his Manchester City team\xe2\x80\x99s latest surrender yesterday. The Chilean may not be talking about his position, but others certainly are. On a day of slim pickings as far as transfer speculation is concerned, the Daily Mail says Pellegrini will be handed his P45 in the wake of yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s humiliation at Old Trafford, with City\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdevelopment squad\xe2\x80\x9d overlord Patrick Vieira being touted as his replacement until the end of the season. Pellegrini isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only Manchester City employee whose future is rumoured to be bleak - incredibly committed, hard-working and loyal midfielder Samir Nasri could be off to Inter this summer, while his team-mates Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 and James Milner are also on Roberto Mancini\xe2\x80\x98s shopping list.</p> <p>With just one year left on his contract, Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid central defender Miranda is available on the cheap and possibly on his way to Chelsea. The league leaders had him watched by their technical director Michael Emenalo over the weekend, as his side drew with Malaga in La Liga. The Brazilian has previously been strongly rumoured to be on his way to Manchester United, but, in a very rare case of this column getting something wrong, that particular move never materialised.</p> <p>West Ham need a right-back. Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Carl Jenkinson is a right-back. You do the sums. The 23-year-old is valued at \xc2\xa310m and apparently surplus to requirements at the Emirates.</p> <p>Despite his apparent paucity of ambition, Newcastle owner Mike Ashley is reported to be ready to splurge \xc2\xa310m on 25-year-old QPR striker Charlie Austin. The Rumour Mill isn\xe2\x80\x99t convinced. According to French newspaper L\xe2\x80\x99Equipe, the Magpies are ready to sign up Jocelyn Gourvennec, manager of midtable Ligue1 side Guingamp as their new boss. Jocelyn who? The 43-year-old is a former Marseille midfielder who played in the French side\xe2\x80\x99s 3-0 defeat at the hands of Parma in the 1990 Uefa Cup final.</p> <p>The Daily Star reckon Pep Guardiola has deemed Robert Lewandowski and Bastian Schweinsteiger surplus to requirements at Bayern Munich, with Manchester United reported to be on red alert. Meanwhile at all-conquering Arsenal, where everything is going so well until something goes horribly wrong, the number of nimble, scampering midfielders on the club\xe2\x80\x99s books has increased by one after Argentinian whelp Maxi Romero signed up for \xc2\xa34.5m from Velez Sarsfield. Aged just 16, he will pitch up at the Emirates in two years time and has already been imaginatively dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cthe new Messi\xe2\x80\x9d.</p>'
