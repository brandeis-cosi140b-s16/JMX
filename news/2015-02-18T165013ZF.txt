b'Feelings of joy like no others | The Fiver'


b'<p>BORE DRAW</p> <p>The Fiver quite likes an interesting tactical battle. The moving and shaping without doing much actual football ignites feelings of joy like no others. Therefore, it is only just that we wax lyrical about last night\xe2\x80\x99s big Big Cup game. Forget Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s 1-1 draw at PSG and do not even consider goals. It was all about the intriguing duel between Shakhtar Donetsk and Bayern Munich, who played out a [insert range of favourite superlatives here] scoreless stalemate. Repeat after me: This is football! This is football!! This is football!!!</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOur task was to restrain Shakhtar\xe2\x80\x99s quick players from unfolding counterattacks. I am happy that we coped with this as they had zero goal chances,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bayern Munich\xe2\x80\x99s tactical genius and innovator in chief, Pep Guardiola, who outsmarted Mircea Lucescu because his team had one shot on target compared to Shakhtar\xe2\x80\x99s zero. Not everyone at Bayern was satisfied, though. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99d offered it me beforehand I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been satisfied,\xe2\x80\x9d guffawed the club\xe2\x80\x99s sporting director, Matthias Sammer, perhaps remembering the opposition were a team who last played a competitive game on 10 September and issues away from football have affected them.</p> <p>Anyway \xe2\x80\xa6 if that tactical feast was a delicious main course from a Michelin-starred restaurant (not that the Fiver has ever frequented such a high-end eatery), tonight\xe2\x80\x99s offering will seem like a dodgy doner kebab from the not-so-fine establishment around the corner from Fiver Towers because, unfortunately, there will be goals which, obviously, makes football less tactically interesting. Boo!</p> <p>Last season Real Madrid shook off the shackles to trounce Schalke 6-1 in Gelsenkirchen, only allowing the Bundesliga side to score in injury time. Real\xe2\x80\x99s boo boys, unsatisfied by La Decima or leading in La Liga, have been directing their ire at Him for Blue Steeling in one too many photos during his 30th birthday party and Gareth Bale because he sometimes forgets to pass the ball, so are demanding a performance despite the fact Spanish supporters don\xe2\x80\x99t tend to travel in big numbers.</p> <p>Basel/Basle/Baaarrl versus Porto, meanwhile, has been billed by some as the worst Big Cup knockout tie ever \xe2\x80\x93 before a ball has been kicked. But the Fiver agrees because both sides were far too entertaining (only Chelsea scored more than Porto) in the group stages and that is just not interesting. Indeed the Fiver may not even bother tuning in, instead choosing to rewatch David Alaba\xe2\x80\x99s 83 passes in Lviv last night from a multitude of angles.</p> <p>SEPP STEPS IN</p> <p>After Chelsea fans were filmed singing a r@cist chant and preventing a black man from boarding the Paris M\xc3\xa9tro last night, Uncle Sepp is here to kick r@cism out of football. \xe2\x80\x9cI condemn the actions of a small group of Chelsea fans in Paris. There is no place for r@cism in football!\xe2\x80\x9d tweeted the Fifa president, perhaps forgetting the time he said \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no r@cism\xe2\x80\x9d in the game during an interview in 2011.</p> <p>Still, it\xe2\x80\x99s a little more action than we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen from Uefa, which has declared it \xe2\x80\x9ccan act on r@cism by players or club staff wherever they happen\xe2\x80\x9d but for \xe2\x80\x9cfan misbehaviour, only inside or around a stadium.\xe2\x80\x9d At least police are treating it very seriously: officers in Paris have launched an investigation into crimes of racial violence on public transport, with Scotland Yard to study footage in a bid to identify those involved.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT! <p>Join Jacob Steinberg for minute-by-minute coverage of Schalke 1-2 Real Madrid and Alan Smith for Basel/Basle/Baaarrl 2-2 Porto at 7.45pm GMT.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9c[He\xe2\x80\x99s] a very good guy and will make a big difference\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Tim Sherwood\xe2\x80\x99s tenure as Aston Villa manager gets off to a disastrous start after being backed by \xe2\x80\x98Aston Villa fan\xe2\x80\x99 David Cameron.</p> YOUR MUNDANE ENCOUNTERS WITH FAMOUS PEOPLE, CHAPTER 923 <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was working in Liberia just prior to the elections in 2003 and met John Fashanu, who was there supporting his mate George Weah. Fash\xe2\x80\x99s grasp of his friend\xe2\x80\x99s campaign priorities underlined why so few footballers are successful in politics\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Felix Edwards.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBack in the vintage Premier League season of 1993-94, my brother and I got wind that a professional footballer had recently moved to our road in rural Leicestershire. Early one Saturday morning we skipped down to the house three doors down, knocked on the door for an autograph but instead of meeting Coventry centre-back and soon-to-be Irish World Cup superstar Phil Babb we were met by a lovely and apologetic blonde lady in her nightie. She very kindly popped upstairs and returned with an autograph for us, before we happily returned home. Later that afternoon, said lovely blonde was walking her dog by our house when my mum invited her in for being so nice, when after a tea and chat her not-so-lovely dog pooed on my mum\xe2\x80\x99s new living room carpet. As many Liverpool fans soon became used to doing, mum blamed Babb for this poor showing and she still enjoys replays of Babb\xe2\x80\x99s goal-post clash a little more than she perhaps should, such is the elephant-memory of wronged football fans\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Jimmy Mayer.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cGoing back a bit here but in 1967 I was 13 years old and more than a bit impressionable. I was allowed, on special occasions, to stay up late and join the clientele in the bar (my mother and father ran a pub in the New Kings Road at the time) and this particular evening I was told by my father that the best player in the world had just arrived in the pub. So you can imagine my disappointment when I saw Chopper Harris propped up at the bar talking to this fella who I didn\xe2\x80\x99t recognise. Plenty of Chelsea players used to frequent our pub in those days and I thought my old man must have been on the sauce if he thought Ron was the best player in the world! It turned out the man he was talking to was Eus\xc3\xa9bio who had just turned out in a friendly for Benfica at the Bridge that evening. Apparently Chopper was a good friend of his and although Eus\xc3\xa9bio had no English, Ron was more than fluent in Portuguese and the Mateus Rose was flowing like the wine it isn\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ross Dunning.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t intended to send this one in, but it\xe2\x80\x99s no more desperate than some of the ones that have been printed. Some years ago, we were driving through Hampstead, when we noticed the extremely expensive car in front of us was being driven by Patrick Vieira. He was accompanied by a young woman, who was eating a 99 ice cream. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let her eat that in there,\xe2\x80\x9d observed my wife, \xe2\x80\x9cnot with that upholstery.\xe2\x80\x9d Believe me, she knows about car upholstery and foodstuffs, what with our backseat being permanently stained by the multiple blackcurrant Fruit Shoots our son once vomited up inside the car on the A412. Perhaps one of the serious football reporters could ask Mr Vieira if any of his own cars have ever suffered similar stainage\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Michael Hann.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cUncle! Uncle! Make the madness stop! Please I beg you. Even these mundane encounters are far too pedestrian for a tea-timely email that normally lacks any humour, let alone any other redeeming quality. Imagine how low the Fiver has become. You are no longer scraping the bottom of the barrel, you have broken through it and are quickly digging to that spot near the Antipodes Islands off New Zealand in the South Pacific\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Steven Mintz.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs an American soccerball enthusiast (USA! USA!! USA!!!), it\xe2\x80\x99s taking me some time to get up to speed on the lingo that your MBM correspondents use. From time to time, some of your writers will refer to a tackle as being agricultural in nature. During the Bayern/Shakhtar game, Ian McCourt referred to a challenge as being industrial. What\xe2\x80\x99s the difference between the two, and were I playing in a game, which one should I fear most? And at what point would a tackle be referred to as technological \xe2\x80\x93 and would that trump agricultural and industrial?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ted Lee.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWas free-kick man (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s last line) meant as a Subbuteo reference (I thought it was corner-kick man myself) or have I missed something? Either way it made me think of our own heady days on the green baize. We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really afford much in the way of accessories but lusted after the scoreboard. Cunningly we spotted that the half-time scoreboard was about a quarter of the price and duly sent off a postal order \xe2\x80\x93 we thought we\xe2\x80\x99d spotted a loophole and could add a full-time, or indeed any time, score while striking a blow against corporate greed. Imagine our eight-year-old dismay when we received a bit of old fence with half the alphabet on\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Tom Levesley.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
