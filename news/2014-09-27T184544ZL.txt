b'Louis van Gaal describes Wayne Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s red-card tackle as \xe2\x80\x98unfriendly\xe2\x80\x99'


b'<p>Louis van Gaal conceded that Wayne Rooney had been \xe2\x80\x9ctoo unfriendly\xe2\x80\x9d after he was sent off for a wild kick at Stewart Downing in a 2-1 victory for Manchester United that ended with Sam Allardyce furiously complaining about a late West Ham effort from Kevin Nolan that was disallowed for offside.</p> <p>Rooney scored the opening goal but was shown a straight red card in front of Roy Hodgson, the England manager, after taking a hack at Downing just before the hour. Allardyce described it as a \xe2\x80\x9ccynical\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9creally poor\xe2\x80\x9d challenge but Van Gaal refused to answer questions about whether it showed Rooney had defects as the club captain. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s neither a good analysis or a good question,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>Rooney had been chasing Downing inside his own half and Van Gaal said it was the player\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to stop West Ham breaking on the counterattack. \xe2\x80\x9cI can see why he made the tackle but I think you have to be far friendlier,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe did it too unfriendly and that is maybe his biggest mistake.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn professional football, you make professional fouls. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it happen five or six times today and, professionally, I can understand that.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut I also saw fouls from West Ham that weren\xe2\x80\x99t punished the same way, so that is a little strange. I have seen other professional fouls without yellow or red\xc2\xa0cards.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Robin van Persie scored the second goal for Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s team before Diafra Sakho made it 2-1 before half-time and Allardyce was aggrieved that Nolan, on as a substitute, was denied a late equaliser by a marginal offside decision. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the linesman can see his head is offside, he is a super linesman, a super human being. He has dropped a massive bollock. It\xe2\x80\x99s onside for me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Rooney will now miss his team\xe2\x80\x99s next three games against Everton, West Bromwich Albion and Chelsea. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a great miss because he plays very well,\xe2\x80\x9d Van Gaal said, praising his players for withstanding a late onslaught.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to fight, fight and fight and I\xe2\x80\x99m very pleased with the attitude of my players. They have fought until the end and after the match I told them [when you do that] you shall always be rewarded with a good result.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
