b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho aims dig at Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s team selection for Real Madrid game'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has offered a thinly veiled criticism of Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s team selection for their game at Real Madrid on Tuesday night by suggesting that, in contrast, he would always select his strongest lineup when confronting \xe2\x80\x9cthe most difficult opponents\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Chelsea visit Anfield on Saturday lunchtime with Liverpool, their Champions League progress far from dependent upon winning in the Bernab\xc3\xa9u, having rested five key players in Jordan Henderson, Raheem Sterling, Mario Balotelli, the captain Steven Gerrard and Philippe Coutinho for their group game against the European champions. Brendan Rodgers has always made clear the Premier League, and finishing in the top four, is his priority.</p> <p>Mourinho offered the caveat he was not speaking specifically \xe2\x80\x9cabout Liverpool\xe2\x80\x9d but, as he prepares to send out a strong side at Maribor on Wednesday, he made clear he would not have adopted such a policy. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t speak about Liverpool, I speak about myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf one day I go to a game and I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel I can win, maybe I don\xe2\x80\x99t go. So, normally, against the most difficult opponents, I will try to go with my best team.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut who knows? Liverpool might play a fantastic match and win and rest players and the players are in great condition to play against Chelsea. In this case it might be a genius decision. In football it is difficult to comment.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Chelsea manager admitted he had gone \xe2\x80\x9ca bit too far\xe2\x80\x9d in his criticism of his own club\xe2\x80\x99s supporters for what he had perceived to be a downbeat atmosphere at Stamford Bridge for Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s derby against Queens Park Rangers. The Portuguese, whose side can potentially secure a place in the knockout phase of the Champions League by winning in Slovenia, had likened that game to playing \xe2\x80\x9cin an empty stadium\xe2\x80\x9d and claimed the atmosphere had worsened since his previous spell at the club.</p> <p>That provoked a furious reaction among some sections of the support. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody at Chelsea knows how much I love the club,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho, who did admit regret to be missing his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s 18th birthday to be in Maribor. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much I want it to improve and how much I want to be part of the club in the future. Everybody knows [this]. Even a moment of criticism has to be analysed with the eyes of somebody who knows why I came back to Chelsea and why I\xe2\x80\x99m here with my heart, and why I want to stay for a long time.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI am just somebody who loves football a lot. I love my job. I am lucky to do my job in the club I like so much and feel such a connection and maybe that makes me lead the club with a different emotion. If I do it in a professional way and concentrate only on training and selection, it is because this is not, for me, just a job. It is more than that, because it\xe2\x80\x99s Chelsea.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe I go a little bit too far. But I see myself in the stands, watching Chelsea and I want to play, I want to help. If I\xe2\x80\x99m not a player I cannot play, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not a coach I cannot make decisions. If I\xe2\x80\x99m just a fan what can I do to help? That\xe2\x80\x99s just my view.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
