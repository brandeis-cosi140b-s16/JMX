b'Magic of the Cup? Manchester United complete decade of televised FA Cup ties'


b'<p>The FA Cup passes a little-known but telling milestone on Monday leading up to Friday\xe2\x80\x99s start of the fourth round. It will be 10 years to the day since Manchester United beat Exeter 2-0 at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park in a third-round replay live on BBC1 \xe2\x80\x93 the start of a remarkable unbroken sequence of United\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup ties being selected by TV companies for live coverage.</p> <p>In 2005 viewers watched Cristiano Ronaldo and Wayne Rooney score against the Conference side to spare Sir Alex Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s blushes after a 0-0 draw at Old Trafford. Friday\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Cambridge, of League Two, will be their 44th consecutive TV tie, with Rooney the sole survivor from 19 January 2005.</p> <p>The unbroken run of appearances compares with Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s 38 out of 46 ties televised during a period in which they won the cup twice, and Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s 37 from 55, during which they won it four times.</p> <p>The search for ratings over the much-quoted \xe2\x80\x9cmagic of the cup\xe2\x80\x9d has often been controversial, depriving some smaller clubs of income. This year\xe2\x80\x99s televised third round ties \xe2\x80\x93 which included Arsenal v Hull City \xe2\x80\x93 earned clubs \xc2\xa3144,000.</p> <p>United\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Cambridge has also put the spotlight on the home side\xe2\x80\x99s effort to maximise ticket revenue. Away fans have complained about prices being raised from \xc2\xa319 to \xc2\xa330, while Cambridge staff attacked a decision to charge them for entry. However, chairman Dave Doggett told The Cambridge News it was the only fair way to deal with the demand for seats. \xe2\x80\x9cAll employees, full-time, part-time, volunteers, directors or anybody associated with the club, are paying. I have got one ticket in the boardroom, and everybody in the ground will be purchasing one.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOne or two members of staff have said they can\xe2\x80\x99t afford it, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve offered to loan them the money. I\xe2\x80\x99ve just tried to be fair across the board.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> A decade on TV <p>United\xe2\x80\x99s unbroken FA Cup run on TV shows the changing landscape of televised football, with the BBC, ITV, Sky Sports, Setanta, ESPN and BT Sport all involved:</p> <p>2005: Exeter (a, replay) BBC, Middlesbrough (h) BBC, Everton (a) BBC, Southampton (a) BBC, Newcastle (n) BBC, Arsenal (n, final) BBC; </p> <p>2006: Burton (a) Sky, Burton (h) BBC, Wolves (a) Sky, Liverpool (a) BBC; </p> <p>2007: A Villa (h) BBC, Portsmouth (h) BBC, Reading (h); BBC, (a, replay) BBC, M\xe2\x80\x99boro (a) BBC, (h, replay); Sky, Watford (n) BBC, Chelsea (n, final) BBC/Sky; </p> <p>2008: A Villa (a) BBC, Tottenham (h) BBC, Arsenal (h) BBC, Portsmouth (h) Sky; </p> <p>2009: Southampton (a) Setanta, Tottenham (h) ITV, Derby (a) ITV, Fulham (a) ITV, Everton (n) ITV; </p> <p>2010: Leeds (h) ITV; </p> <p>2011: Liverpool (h) ITV, Southampton (a) ITV, Crawley\xc2\xa0(h) ITV, Arsenal (h) ITV, Man City (n) ITV; </p> <p>2012: Man City (a) ITV, Liverpool (a) ITV; </p> <p>2013: West Ham (a) ITV, (h, replay) ITV, Fulham (h) ESPN, Reading (h) ESPN, Chelsea (h) ITV, (a, replay) ITV; </p> <p>2014: Swansea (h) BT Sport; 2015 Yeovil (a) BT Sport, Cambridge (a) BBC</p>'
