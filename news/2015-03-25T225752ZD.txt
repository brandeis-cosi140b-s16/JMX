b'Diego Costa blames Christmas fixtures for Chelsea Champions League exit'


b'<p>Diego Costa has told the Spanish sports paper Marca that the Christmas fixture list in England undermined Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League campaign, which was ended by Paris Saint-Germain in the last 16.</p> <p>The Spain international striker said: \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe the Christmas exertions have taken their toll. We played three matches in seven days. It\xe2\x80\x99s no excuse though.\xe2\x80\x9d But he added: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure next season we\xe2\x80\x99ll go further in the Champions League.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea drew 1-1 with PSG at the Parc des Princes in the first leg but went out on away goals at Stamford Bridge after Thiago Silva equalised six minutes from the end of extra time to earn the French champions a 2-2 draw.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe had enough quality to play a different game [in London] but it was not to be,\xe2\x80\x9d Costa said. \xe2\x80\x9cPSG have a great team and we have to accept it and congratulate them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Costa, who is absent from international duty because of a hamstring injury, has been impressed by the standard of the Premier League describing it as \xe2\x80\x9ca tough league with some great teams in it, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s overrated\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>He has enjoyed pitting his skills against Premier League defenders. \xe2\x80\x9cI take a beating constantly, just like in Spain,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m not complaining. They go in hard, but also you don\xe2\x80\x99t get the free-kicks you do in Spain. Sometimes defenders try to target me and put me off my game, but my self-control is getting better and I just try to do my thing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Costa said he found Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho had shared characteristics with Diego Simeone, the coach of his former club Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re similar in many respects,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have the same vision and the same hunger to win. Mou has been winning things for many years now and has a wealth of experience. The same goes for Simeone. They both have the same ambition and a similar way of looking at matches.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
