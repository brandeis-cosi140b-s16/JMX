b'Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend'


b'1) Will City cope with United\xe2\x80\x99s middle managers? <p>It says much about Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s malaise that the one area the balance of power looks likely to be decided in the Manchester derby is midfield \xe2\x80\x93 often the territory in recent seasons where no other team has been able to touch the combination of power and panache that Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 and David Silva offered the 2012 and 2014 champions. In recent months this is the area that Louis van Gaal has finally got to grips with while Manuel Pellegrini has floundered over his malfunctioning engine room. Michael Carrick, Ander Herrera and the advanced physical presence of Marouane Fellaini have proven a sturdy and no-nonsense solution to a United problem that has been talked about since Roy Keane\xe2\x80\x99s departure many years ago. </p> <p>While Fellaini has been rightly lauded for his ability to pluck the ball out of the air with unfathomable regularity in recent matches, his use of the ball when he has got it down on the floor has often been overlooked. He very rarely gave the ball away in a dominant display at Anfield. Herrera and Carrick have proven adept at controlling traffic deeper in midfield too. Indeed, this could prove too much for a City midfield in which Tour\xc3\xa9 appears to have given up the ghost and only the prosaic presence of Fernandinho seems to be functioning. City can be among the league\xe2\x80\x99s most inventive teams when things are going their way but when the chips are down the creative juices of Silva, Jes\xc3\xbas Navas, Samir Nasri and Tour\xc3\xa9 often dry up. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard not to see midfield being the key battleground again \xe2\x80\x93 and unless City find some extra pep from Tour\xc3\xa9 and co, they may end up nursing another wounding defeat on the road. GB</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s masterstroke: Fellaini as a deep-lying target man\xe2\x80\xa2 Ag\xc3\xbcero: scoring at Manchester United almost gives me shivers\xe2\x80\xa2 Young calls on Manchester United to end losing run against City\xe2\x80\xa2 Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s malaise: five problem areas to address</p>           City\xe2\x80\x99s Manuel Pellegrini denies job is on line after Crystal Palace defeat    2) Hull\xe2\x80\x99s hellish run-in begins <p> Hull City are two points above the relegation zone but do not have control of their own destiny. Because no one does, that\xe2\x80\x99s what destiny means! Still, Steve Bruce has more to worry about than a contradictory clich\xc3\xa9, such as a creative department with no invention and a fixture list that could not look more daunting if it were written in blood. Five of Hull\xe2\x80\x99s remaining matches are against teams in the top seven, starting with the ominous trek to Southampton. Hull have failed to score in 13 of their last 23 matches and it is difficult to imagine them finding the net against a Southampton side who continue to defend superbly, especially if Dame N\xe2\x80\x99Doye performs as he did at Swansea last week, when the usually threatening striker seemed distracted by his own frustration. The most realistic rosy scenario for Bruce is that Graziano Pell\xc3\xa8\xe2\x80\x99s woes in front of goal linger, Shane Long continues his dry finishing spell and Allen McGregor recovers from his recent bout of the jitters to keep goal with solidity. PD</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Chelsea target Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s Morgan Schneiderlin and Nathaniel Clyne</p> 3) Sherwood should resist his desire to go to Spurs all guns blazing <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s hard not to imagine Tim Sherwood swaggering back into White Hart Lane like a vengeful cowboy returning to the tumbleweed-town in which he was wronged. Everything about his character suggests he\xe2\x80\x99ll want to prove a point by firing his players out of a gun at the opposition on Saturday afternoon. He has a potent weapon in Christian Benteke \xe2\x80\x93 and Sherwood is more than capable of damaging his former employer by setting his team up to make the most of the in-form Belgian. But while the Aston Villa manager has finally managed to wring some goals out of his shot-shy squad in recent fixtures, it has come at a cost. Villa are just as likely to let in three goals as they are to score them at present. Villa face Manchester City in the league after their trip to Spurs. Laying off the gung-ho attitude of recent games and allowing a little of the Lambertism that still remains in his squad to resurface, may be more helpful. Gaining a point may be Sherwood\xe2\x80\x99s best way to prove one at White Hart Lane. GB</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Hugo Lloris a serious doubt for Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s game with Villa</p>           Sherwood praises Christian Benteke after hat trick against QPR    4) QPR\xe2\x80\x99s dynamism gives them hope \xe2\x80\xa6 even against Chelsea <p> What refreshing change Chris Ramsey has brought to QPR, who so often seemed stagnant under Harry Redknapp. True, a couple of performances under the new manager have reeked but mostly Rangers have seemed invigorated, with new dynamism and effectiveness on the pitch reflecting the energy and adaptability with which Ramsey has sought solutions to the squad\xe2\x80\x99s many deficiencies. Some of his ploys have backfired \xe2\x80\x93 resurrecting Shaun Wright-Phillips in an attempt to help young Darnell Furlong subdue Yannick Bolasie at Crystal Palace certainly did not work \xe2\x80\x93 but Ramsey has adapted quickly to misjudgments and continued to try stimulating positive change. That attitude has, mostly, been shared by the players. Rangers\xe2\x80\x99 defence is still rickety and Chelsea, with Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my likely to start in his return to Loftus Road in the absence of Diego Costa, should be able to outscore their hosts. But if the league leaders are as below par as they have been quite often in recent months, then they could be in for another chastening time at the home of their local rivals. PD</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Chelsea make \xc2\xa34m bid to sign Japan forward Yoshinori Muto\xe2\x80\xa2 Forget about Ronaldo, it is QPR\xe2\x80\x99s Phillips you need to worry about\xe2\x80\xa2 Video: Ramsey on QPR\xe2\x80\x99s defence after 3-3 draw with Aston Villa</p> 5) An ethical dilemma for Dyche? <p> The new bishop of Burnley, the Right Reverend Philip North, revealed this week that he has been praying for Sean Dyche\xe2\x80\x99s team to stay in the Premier League. Asking a god to intervene to relegate Leicester, QPR and, say, Sunderland, seems gravely unsporting and possibly even evil, so the good bishop presumably made a more nuanced supplication. And perhaps he could even offer some ethical advice to Dyche, who may be, but probably isn\xe2\x80\x99t, grappling with the question of whether to rest his entire first team for the visit of Arsenal this weekend. It is not beyond the realms of possibility that Burnley will derail the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s most in-form team, but it might be more realistic for Burnley to target their six other remaining league matches, all of which look eminently more winnable. So rather than risk injury to Danny Ings and co, what if Dyche made the pragmatic decision to tone down his club\xe2\x80\x99s pluckiness this weekend in order to be even stronger during the rest of the run-in? The fact that such a move would undoubtedly infuriate Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho might seem satisfying revenge for the Chelsea manager\xe2\x80\x99s attack on Ashley Barnes earlier this season but should probably not come into the reckoning. PD</p>           Wenger: Arsenal don\xe2\x80\x99t have to sell their best players any more    6) Sunderland aren\xe2\x80\x99t facing Hull \xe2\x80\x93 and that\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing <p>Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s past three victories over Newcastle have each been followed by a defeat \xe2\x80\xa6 to Hull. It\xe2\x80\x99s a curious statistic. All that emotional expenditure has come at a cost \xe2\x80\x93 and has been expertly exploited by Steve Bruce, the man who believes he probably should still be in charge at Sunderland. Anyway, Dick Advocaat\xe2\x80\x99s objective should be to ensure he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t allow Crystal Palace and Alan Pardew - a man who also knows a thing or two about Tyne-Wear derbies \xe2\x80\x93 to take advantage of any slip in intensity levels when his side face Palace at the Stadium of Light on Saturday. Connor Wickham has spoken of the Dutchman\xe2\x80\x99s steeliness in training sessions and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t foresee them making the same mistakes they have made after recent derby wins. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of grit about us \xe2\x80\xa6 we\xe2\x80\x99re not looking down, we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at who we can catch and suck in \xe2\x80\x93 put them in the fight instead of us.\xe2\x80\x9d A win against Palace would certainly go some way to sucking their local rivals into the mire with them. GB\xe2\x80\xa2 Defoe says derby winner as good as World Cup goal\xe2\x80\xa2 Dominic Fifield: Palace feel the benefit of Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Indian summer</p> 7) How will Newcastle fans react at Anfield? <p>WDLLLWDDLWLLLL </p> <p>Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s league form in 2015 is miserable. It\xe2\x80\x99s fast approaching the depths of 2014 that led to a banner being displayed by miffed supporters at Swansea last October likening last year\xe2\x80\x99s results to a Welsh town. If you go back even further, to November 2014, the run of results is eerily similar \xe2\x80\x93 and just plain dreadful. Alan Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s departure goes some way to explaining the staggering downturn but, as has been made clear in recent weeks, the lack of ambition from the board is startling. The decision to wait until the end of the season to find a successor to Pardew could be one of Mike Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s most costly mistakes. It\xe2\x80\x99s an example of the lack of care and attention that could lead to fans being absent at just the time when the team needs them most. </p> <p>A run of four losses in a row \xe2\x80\x93 including the spiritless defeat at Sunderland last Sunday \xe2\x80\x93 has tipped some of the most faithful supporters (often lampooned for their unswerving loyalty) over the edge. Plans for a boycott of Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s home match against Spurs on Sunday 19 April are being made. If three points are surrendered again at Anfield, the team could then be hovering dangerously close to the relegation zone. You can attach no blame to exasperated supporters, who feel as though they are constantly being being milked for every spare penny and receiving so little in return, for choosing to stay at home. But an injury-ravaged paper-thin squad devoid of confidence, character and goals will probably need a bit of vocal encouragement for a testing run-in. How the fans in the away end react at Anfield will go some way to revealing whether John Carver\xe2\x80\x99s struggling team will get it. GB</p>  <li>Newcastle: billboard for cheapness or empire of hopes and dreams?</li> <li>David Squires on \xe2\x80\xa6 Mike Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s reign at Newcastle</li> <li>Liverpool relief but Rodgers knows side must do better</li> <li>Balotelli posts thermometer picture after missing cup tie</li>            Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Brendan Rodgers encouraged after FA Cup win    8) Will Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s new-found zen help Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s late survival bid? <p>For a manager who has often seemed on the verge of spontaneous combustion this season, Nigel Pearson has cut a very relaxed figure since watching Andy King give his team\xe2\x80\x99s hopes of survival a shot in the arm with his winning goal against West Ham last weekend. \xe2\x80\x9cMy job with the players is to try to release them from the pressure that comes from external influences,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in the buildup to the match against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have got to try to go out there and keep free and play games. Results elsewhere will affect other people\xe2\x80\x99s views and perspectives on our run-in and what our prospects are. Whatever happens elsewhere, we have to remain very much in control of what we can do ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d With a game or two in hand over their closest rivals in the muck and the mire at the bottom of the league, the Leicester manager may have found just the right time to infuse a little calm in the dressing room. His squad\xe2\x80\x99s average age is just shy of 29, as well as a lack of optimism from many observers of their plight, may also help keep the pressure off at a crucial time. West Brom isn\xe2\x80\x99t a bad place to be visiting. Tony Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s team have slipped back into danger after suffering two defeats in their past two league games. GB</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Football Weekly Extra: the fight to stay in the Premier League</p> 9) Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s ambition may lead to rare mid-table excitement \xe2\x80\xa6 <p>Despite Harry Redknapp\xe2\x80\x99s amusing and apparently heartfelt recent declaration that the scramble to avoid Europa League qualification is now on, Garry Monk insists he would love to lead Swansea City back into into the competition after the club\xe2\x80\x99s involvement last season. \xe2\x80\x9cThe overview is that we had a taste of Europe last year, everyone enjoyed it and, of course, you\xe2\x80\x99d love to get back to that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at the beginning of last month. Should Arsenal or Liverpool win the FA Cup, qualification for Europe\xe2\x80\x99s second-tier competition could go to the seventh-placed team in the Premier League and with Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s form of late having been patchy, one suspects Monk will fancy his team\xe2\x80\x99s chances of closing the seven-point gap that separates the sides and reeling them in.</p> <p>Just one point off their previous best Premier League tally, the Swans are pitted against Everton in a Saturday lunchtime fixture. Along with Kenny Jackett and Brendan Rodgers, Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez is one of several highly regarded coaches at whose collective knee the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s youngest manager has learned the skills that have helped ensure his first season in charge has been such a success. Indeed, the copious amount of points his team have dropped from winning positions, often off the back of some truly diabolical officiating, must have Monk pondering what might have been in the precious few idle moments that are afforded to him in his role as a young Premier League manager and father to infant twins.</p> <p>The familiarity of both clubs and their quietly determined and ambitious managers, Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s push for Europe and the prevailing sense that Mart\xc3\xadnez knows he has yet to truly convince Everton fans, suggests that a match which, on first glance resembles an exercise in mid-table futility, may be one of the more interesting and competitive this weekend.

With both sides too good to go down, but not good enough to break through the glass ceiling and rub shoulders with the Premier League big boys, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to know where either can go from here. Faces nightclub in Essex is hosting an Easter After Party with free admission for members and girls before 11pm on Saturday night, so don\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if some of those involved in this fixture end up there.
