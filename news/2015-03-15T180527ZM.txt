b'Manchester United v Tottenham: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened | Michael Butler'


b'<p>Well that was a heady dose of nostalgia, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Manchester United, fluid and incisive, looking every inch their former selves, and took Tottenham apart in the first half. Time and time again, Tottenham were carved open down their right-hand side. Poor Kyle Walker, he had a torrid afternoon.</p> <p>Louis van Gaal said pre-match that \xe2\x80\x9cFor us, reaching the Champions League this season is like a title.\xe2\x80\x9d Manchester United now have a five-point lead over Liverpool in fifth place, and as long as LVG plays four at the back and leaves Di Maria out the team (...) they should be just fine.</p> <p>Tottenham have fallen to seventh behind Southampton, following Saints\xe2\x80\x99 draw at Chelsea. They were awful today, and took 88 minutes to have a shot on target. Kane didn\xe2\x80\x99t have hit best game, but he had no support going forward. Pochettino should shoulder most of the game: tactically, Tottenham got it all wrong.</p> <p>Thanks for your emails, tweets and goal celebrations \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s been a hoot. Bye!</p>'
