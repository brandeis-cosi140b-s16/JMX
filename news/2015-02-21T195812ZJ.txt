b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho blames referee for Nemanja Matic\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has suggested that only bad decisions by officials can prevent his team from winning the Premier League title this season. The Chelsea manager continued his campaign against what he sees as the injustices that have hampered his side after Chelsea dropped two points at home to Burnley and had Nemanja Matic sent off \xe2\x80\x93 an outcome Mourinho says arose because of four calls by Martin Atkinson.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m happy that I\xe2\x80\x99m not stupid and I understood everything a couple of months ago,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you tell me this story that started a couple of months ago finished today and now we have 12 matches to play with an advantage of five points, I tell you [we will be] champions. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that story ends here or if you have more waiting for us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea were 1-0 up against Sean Dyche\xe2\x80\x99s relegation-threatened team before Matic was sent off in the 69th minute for shoving Ashley Barnes after an ugly challenge by the Burnley forward.</p>  <p> Related: Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho spot-on with response to Chelsea fans\xe2\x80\x99 Paris incident | Paul Wilson </p>   <p>Eleven minutes later Ben Mee equalised. Mourinho said the match would not have been drawn if the referee had not turned down two penalty appeals and had punished Barnes for two tackles that Mourinho suggested were worthy of red cards.</p> <p>After saying he did not wish to speak at length about the decisions, Mourinho said: \xe2\x80\x9cI prefer just to say that this game had four crucial moments: minutes 30, 33, 43 and 69. This is story of the game. I cannot comment because it is difficult for me not to say the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>That referred, respectively, to a tackle by Barnes on Branislav Ivanovic that drew no reaction from the referee; Michael Kightly blocking an Ivanovic shot with his arm in the box, which the referee apparently did not consider deliberate handball; Diego Costa falling in the box under pressure from Jason Shackell; and Barnes catching Matic halfway up the Serb\xe2\x80\x99s shin and provoking the retaliation that led to the Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s player\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal.</p>  <p> Related: Back on home turf, Chelsea fans condemn club\xe2\x80\x99s Paris racism shame </p>   <p>Mourinho did not defend Matic\xe2\x80\x99s reaction but suggested that Barnes should not have been on the pitch to make the tackle. He also invited comparisons between Barnes\xe2\x80\x99s tackle and the clash between Diego Costa and Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Emre Can last month that led to the Chelsea striker being suspended for a stamp.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMinute 69 [Matic\xe2\x80\x99s shove on Barnes] has a big relation with minute 30,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cThe player, if I can call him a player, who was involved in minute 30, normally in minute 31 he should be in the shower. No minute 69 if the person in charge does the things in the proper way in minute 30.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cA couple of weeks ago when I was here after the Liverpool game, I knew already that the \xe2\x80\x98Diego crimes\xe2\x80\x99 were going to be on and on and on. Compare \xe2\x80\x98Diego\xe2\x80\x99s crimes\xe2\x80\x99 with what happened today.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho scoffed at the idea of Chelsea appealing against Matic\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you ever seen Chelsea win an appeal?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Burnley manager, Sean Dyche, professed to being \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely flummoxed\xe2\x80\x9d by Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that decisions had more to do with the result than Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s performance but said he would study all four incidents. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve had decisions go against us this season. If some went for us today, c\xe2\x80\x99est la vie.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
