b'Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat hits out at Premier League schedule'


b'<p>Dick Advocaat would like all fixtures on the final four weekends of the Premier League season to kick off at the same time on the same day.</p> <p>Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s manager accepts the current system, staggered at varying hours over Saturday, Sunday and Monday, is designed to suit the demands of the game\xe2\x80\x99s broadcast paymasters but, in an ideal world, he feels synchronicity would make the battle to avoid relegation fairer.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think, in these circumstances, the last four rounds of games should all be played at the same time and not at different times,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Dutchman.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn Holland they do the last two games of the season at the same time. If the kick-offs are together we don\xe2\x80\x99t have teams knowing how we\xe2\x80\x99ve got on if we\xe2\x80\x99ve played early.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Sunderland kick off at lunchtime against Everton at Goodison Park on Saturday and Advocaat \xe2\x80\x93 whose third-bottom side subsequently have a home match with Leicester, followed by trips to Arsenal and Chelsea \xe2\x80\x93 is desperate to engineer a win.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe have no time to have setbacks \xe2\x80\x93 the other teams at the bottom are winning as well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt could go the last game of the season but confidence will be the key element for the teams that stay up.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>With Advocaat having presided over the collection of seven points from his five games in charge, Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s decision to hire him as Gus Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s replacement looks a smart one. Even so, the former Holland manager accepts Ellis Short, the club\xe2\x80\x99s owner, gambled in hiring a coach lacking previous experience of English football.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s always difficult to bring in a foreign coach nine games before the end of the season,\xe2\x80\x9d said the 67-year-old, who will welcome back Wes Brown from injury at Everton, where he will be without the hamstrung John O\xe2\x80\x99Shea. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not a real English-type coach so they took a risk by that, that the team have adapted really quickly to the way we work. We never speak about the previous coaches. They have gone, we are in and we have to do it.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot do it on your own. Understanding that is the most important thing. The consequences of when we go down is for the players, so very high. I have told them all. That kind of thing you need to talk to them about and they know what they have to do.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
