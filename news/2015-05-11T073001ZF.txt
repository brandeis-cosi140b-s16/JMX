b'Football: 10 talking points from the weekend\xe2\x80\x99s action'


b'1) Pellegrini will have eye on Bayern v Barcelona  <p> Related: QPR\xe2\x80\x99s Chris Ramsey agrees with Joey Barton\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98bad eggs\xe2\x80\x99 criticism </p>   <p>The question of whether Pep Guardiola will replace Manuel Pellegrini as Manchester City manager continues to linger and may do so until Bayern Munich offer a clarification on their coach\xe2\x80\x99s future. This may or may not come after the German club\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League semi-final second leg with Barcelona on Tuesday evening in Bavaria. Bayern have to overturn a 3-0 deficit and the thinking is that Guardiola could \xe2\x80\x93 only could, mind \xe2\x80\x93 be removed if FC Hollywood are knocked out, as is expected.</p> <p>After City\xe2\x80\x99s 6-0 hammering of Queens Park Rangers at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, Pellegrini claimed to have no knowledge of the latest rumours linking Guardiola with his job. Yet the Chilean is well aware his ongoing employment at the club continues to dangle, with a major factor the wait City are undertaking to see precisely where Guardiola is to work next year. Somehow this does not seem the most savoury way of doing business for any club, major or otherwise.

The visitors ended a run of six games without a goal, rediscovering their fighting spirit at the exact moment it became too late. Hull, meanwhile, mustered three shots on target from a total of 21, unable to break through against a team whose fate was sealed. Home fans who stuck around to see Burnley players drop to the turf at the final whistle may feel they\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the ghost of a Saturday soon to come.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEvery time we come to a game we are expected to win, we seem to struggle\xe2\x80\x9d was Steve Bruce\xe2\x80\x99s verdict. The league table might lead some to suggest that such games must be few and far between, but Bruce does have a point. Hull have welcomed all of their relegation rivals to the KC since Christmas, but have beaten only Aston Villa and QPR.</p> <p>The battle to avoid the drop may again come down to fine margins, but gaining a solitary point from home games against Newcastle, Leicester, Burnley and Sunderland, failing to score in any of them, isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly a minor detail. Victory against either Spurs or Manchester United, and matching last season\xe2\x80\x99s record Premier League points total, is now realistically what is required for Hull to avoid a fate that Bruce will find tough to label undeserved. Niall McVeigh</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Bruce blames himself for Hull\xe2\x80\x99s poor performance\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Hull City 0-1 Burnley</p>  3) Cleverley has been revived under Sherwood at Aston Villa <p>At one stage this season, the brutal truth is that Aston Villa supporters could not have cared less whether Tom Cleverley was interested in joining them on a permanent basis in the summer. How times have changed. With Tim Sherwood in charge, Cleverley is unrecognisable from the player that toiled under Paul Lambert, whose slow, prosaic, desperately dull football was strangling the life out of the Villa team. Cleverley may not be everyone\xe2\x80\x99s cup of tea and he has put up with some scathing \xe2\x80\x93 at times unfair \xe2\x80\x93 criticism in his career, including that online petition that resulted in 10,000 people calling for him to be left out of Roy Hodgson\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup squad last year. What we have seen at Villa since Sherwood took over, however, is a reminder of what Cleverley is capable of when a manager shows confidence in him, plays him in his best position (which is not scurrying around in front of the back four) and gives him the freedom \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9ctaken the shackles off\xe2\x80\x9d was the phrase that the midfielder used \xe2\x80\x93 to go out and express himself. Villa fans just hope that they will be seeing more of the same next season.

Leicester City\xe2\x80\x99s Danish goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel makes a save against Everton. Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images    <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s time for a referendum on Europe. Everyone makes the right noises but which clubs in their right minds would actively bid to qualify for the Europa League? Southampton, insipid in the decisive opening 20 minutes at Leicester and with one win in six games, and Tottenham Hotspur, flip-flopping through to the summer holidays, seem to be waging their own contest to see who can bomb out of the top six first. Then they\xe2\x80\x99ll probably don their claret and blue scarves and cheer Aston Villa on in the FA Cup final so that the third Europa League ticket doesn\xe2\x80\x99t ensnare the seventh-place finishers.</p> <p>Southampton have enjoyed a wonderful first season under Ronald Koeman, making light of the departures of their star players last summer to play some delightful football, but should the reward for an upwardly mobile club who miss out on the Champions League really be the prospect of a potential 19-game marathon that stretches your squad to breaking point and barely makes any money?</p> <p>Over the last 10 years, teams qualifying for the Europa League group stages have suffered an average fall of 2.3 places in the Premier League. Two-thirds of entrants have fallen lower in the domestic table while attempting to juggle the demands of Thursday night continental capers with Sunday league duties. Wigan Athletic and Birmingham City entered through winning a domestic cup and then became spread so thinly that they were worse off.</p> <p>The obvious solution is to make Europe\xe2\x80\x99s secondary tournament a straight knockout competition. Then Southampton might be straining at the leash to remain competitive till the very end, instead of turning up half asleep. Peter Lansley</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Leicester 2-0 Southampton\xe2\x80\xa2 The Premier League relegation contenders battling to escape the drop</p>  5) Loftus-Cheek can flourish \xe2\x80\x93 if he is given the chance <p>If Ruben Loftus-Cheek felt a little green making his full Chelsea debut at Stamford Bridge, he could at least console himself with the fact that he has been at the club longer than any other starting player, John Terry aside. Loftus-Cheek joined Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s age-group teams in 2004, the same year Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho first pitched up in west London. Against Liverpool he was part of a muscular central midfield alongside Mikel John Obi, also a prodigy in his time and now evolved into the footballing equivalent of a dirty pair of wellies Mourinho can pull out of his car boot as the occasion demands.</p> <p>Loftus-Cheek played well, too, starting as the deepest of Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s midfielders, occasionally stepping in between his centre-halves, looking composed and completing 100% of some safe and sensible passes. He is an interesting player for various reasons, not least his rarity. Not just as a Chelsea product, although the cavalry is already galloping up behind and it is to be hoped Dominic Solanke, Patrick Bamford and others get a chance too before long. But also as an English player of his type, a high-class, ball-playing 6ft 4in central midfielder whose game is essentially defensive, based not around explosive bursts forward but in covering space, policing between the lines and retaining possession. It seems likely Loftus-Cheek\xe2\x80\x99s real merits won\xe2\x80\x99t become clear until he is given the chance to play a part in a defensive performance against strong opposition, but in his hour at Stamford Bridge he looked promising: disciplined, strong and clever off the ball.</p> <p>He is also an intriguing prospect for Mourinho himself. Unlike other modern mega-managers, Mourinho has no great legacy of nurturing rather than assembling a team, no history of blooding and bringing on top-class young players, a rare missing tick on his managerial CV. Loftus-Cheek played well enough to suggest he might flourish with a proper run in the team next year. Over to you, Jos\xc3\xa9. Barney Ronay</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Chelsea 1-1 Liverpool\xe2\x80\xa2 Loftus-Cheek gives glimpse of future</p>  6) Colback has been a wonderful signing for Newcastle <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see what he does well.\xe2\x80\x9d It was a cutting put-down issued by Alan Pardew two years ago during an off-the-record lunch with north-east-based journalists. The subject was Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s Jack Colback and there was accordingly considerable surprise when Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s former manager signed the midfielder the following summer and promptly predicted he would play for England. A couple of years ago Pardew was much more interested in poaching Phil Bardsley \xe2\x80\x93 now at Stoke \xe2\x80\x93 from the Stadium of Light but regular Sunderland watchers were not surprised by his subsequent, swift, conversion to Colback\xe2\x80\x99s charms. Along with Daryl Janmaat, the unshowy yet slick passing, invariably intelligently positioned and highly efficient central midfielder is one of two realistic contenders for Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s player of the season award. It is no exaggeration to say that, without Colback, the team could have been relegated by now. Against West Brom on Saturday he was edged, narrowly, out of the man of the match stakes by the talented, powerful but much more erratic Moussa Sissoko yet still shone. It is salutary to reflect that whereas Colback, out of contract on Wearside last year, arrived on a free transfer, the much more vaunted yet infinitely less effective R\xc3\xa9my Cabella cost around \xc2\xa312m. Louise Taylor</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Carver glad to end losing run after \xe2\x80\x98toughest week of my life\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Newcastle 1-1 West Brom</p>  7) Smalling has improved for Manchester United \xe2\x80\x93 but not by enough <p>Plenty of criticism has been aimed at Chris Smalling in the past two seasons, but his performances at the heart of the Manchester United defence in recent months have been vastly improved. He has done well to drown out the doubters. Yet although he is defending well, his distribution still leaves much to be desired. Smalling\xe2\x80\x99s passing was poor in United\xe2\x80\x99s win over Crystal Palace. His discomfort on the ball partly explains why England struggle at tournaments and Smalling must fine-tune that part of his game if he is to thrive under Louis van Gaal.

Now, ridiculously, the spectre has been raised that it could exert a similarly ruinous impact on another. English clubs will be granted another place in Europe\xe2\x80\x99s most draining competition next season as a result of their good behaviour. Everton could claim it, should they finish highest in the Fair Play League among the teams who have not already qualified for continental competition. Their major rivals for the booby prize are West Ham. Their opponents on Saturday are also West Ham. Will the two sides take the Machiavellian option of trying to kick each other into oblivion in the hope a referee will take suitable disciplinary action to spare them a season in Europe? Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez insists not. One of life\xe2\x80\x99s great optimists said he would \xe2\x80\x9clove\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cembrace\xe2\x80\x9d the challenge, even though it would mean their season starts on 2 July. Everton\xe2\x80\x99s internationals would miss the early rounds but Mart\xc3\xadnez believes that could afford an opportunity to their younger players. Yet this, surely, is not a chance, but a poisoned chalice. Richard Jolly</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Everton 0-2 Sunderland\xe2\x80\xa2 Advocaat hits out at Premier League schedule</p>  9) Stoke have style to match their swagger <p>Tottenham have the style and image while Stoke are still regarded as the vagabonds of the Premier League. But could this be changing for the Potters? They have stopped pottering about down the bottom end of the table and play with a bit of swagger now. Their manager, Mark Hughes, said it was his priority to up Stoke\xe2\x80\x99s game to turn them into a top-10 side. He\xe2\x80\x99s achieving it. John Wragg</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Stoke City 3-0 Tottenham Hotspur</p>  10) Ipswich spirit makes writing them off a foolhardy pursuit     ipswich\xe2\x80\x99s Paul Anderson scores past Martin Olsson of Norwich. Photograph: Jamie McDonald/Getty Images    <p>The result of Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s ferociously fought, tension-filled East Anglian derby means this Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s second-leg showdown at Carrow Road has more at stake than perhaps ever in this game before. Home advantage will probably not give Norwich much of an edge \xe2\x80\x93 all three matches that they have lost under Alex Neil were at Carrow Road \xe2\x80\x93 but the fact they have more skilful and creative players could. But Ipswich showed again on Saturday that their dynamism and spirit make writing them off foolish, and Daryl Murphy and Freddie Sears were a menace to Norwich\xe2\x80\x99s defence. Predict the outcome if you dare. Paul Doyle</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Championship semi-final play-off match report: Ipswich 1-1 Norwich</p> '
