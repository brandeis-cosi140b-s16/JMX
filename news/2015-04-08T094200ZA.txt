b'<p>\xe2\x80\x9cArs\xc3\xa8ne\xe2\x80\x99s softer centre in my later years reflected the players he brought to the club. Samir Nasri becomes available, so Ars\xc3\xa8ne takes him. Rosicky becomes available, so he takes him, because he\xe2\x80\x99s his type of player. Arshavin becomes available, so in he comes. When you acquire a lot of these players, they are almost clones.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>That skewering of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s transfer business by Sir Alex Ferguson in his autobiography chimed with so much of what the casual observer thinks about the Arsenal manager. Along with the cliched comments about the Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s love of fleet-of-foot, diminutive No10s came the befuddled bemusement at his refusal to purchase the solid, wardrobe-sized central midfield enforcer he seemed to love in his early days at the club. His \xe2\x80\x9csofter centre\xe2\x80\x9d seemed to be perfectly encapsulated in the purchase of Mesut \xc3\x96zil for \xc2\xa342.5m at a time when fans were crying out for something sturdier.</p>  <p> Related: Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Jack Wilshere steps up comeback from injury in Under-21 win over Stoke </p>   <p>But now what are we to think? Arsenal are the form team in the Premier League, and the side with the most goalscorers in the league this season \xe2\x80\x93 15 in all. A squad at last, rather than a talented XI doomed to be undone by troublesome absences year after year. This time, rather than sinking their campaign, the apparent misfortune of injuries allowed Francis Coquelin to return from loan at Charlton and step in to the holding midfield role to demonstrate just what Arsenal had been missing. It\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that the reliably conservative 23-year-old is the only midfielder to have featured and not found himself on the scoresheet (Mikel Arteta has not found the net in the league, but has a cup goal to his name). Of course, a narrower selection of goalscorers needn\xe2\x80\x99t hinder a team \xe2\x80\x93 Swansea have the joint-fewest on seven \xe2\x80\x93 but it certainly eases the pressure on individuals to perform; pressure which at times in the past has cramped Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s style.</p> <p>Liverpool and Manchester City \xe2\x80\x93 both teams with a plethora of attacking midfielders that Wenger would approve of \xe2\x80\x93 both have 14 league goalscorers a piece \xe2\x80\x93 but what is striking is the way they have been shared out. While Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero tops the charts with 17 league goals, David Silva, Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9, Frank Lampard and Stevan Jovetic all have five or more. In contrast, Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s top scorers are Steven Gerrard, Jordan Henderson and Raheem Sterling \xe2\x80\x93 all with six. Replacing the goals of Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez was always going to be tough but Brendan Rodgers surely did not expect such a lack of goals from a team who pride themselves on exciting, attacking football. The absence of Daniel Sturridge (through injury) and Mario Balotelli (through lack of form) has left the Merseyside club with a reliance on Wenger-esque midfielders (Adam Lallana, Philippe Coutinho, Lazar Markovic, Sterling) which has seen their attacking play blunted by sameness.</p> <p>Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s goal difference of just +9 is some way short of their opponents for the top four; City with +33, United +27 and Arsenal +30. Southampton, now just a point behind the Merseyside team are on +20 \xe2\x80\x93 in no small part down to the meanest defence in the division. None of their 13 goalscorers has more than Graziano Pell\xc3\xa8\xe2\x80\x99s eight, but the squad have shared the burden and maintained defensive discipline to keep alive hopes of a European place. The heft of Morgan Schneiderlin and Victor Wanyama in midfield, behind the more deft talents of Dusan Tadic, James Ward-Prowse and Sadio Man\xc3\xa9, has been key to their success.</p> <p>And what of United? Ferguson may have scoffed at Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s penchant for a mini-midfielder, but it has been Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s rediscovery of the charms of Juan Mata that has rejuvenated their season. With 12 goalscorers, United have the fewest of the teams in the top four, but where Liverpool often have a host of similar attackers, Van Gaal has a diverse group to play with. He can call on the bulk of Marouane Fellaini, the bombastic drive of Wayne Rooney and (occasionally) the lethal precision of Robin van Persie\xe2\x80\x99s left foot to complement Mata\xe2\x80\x99s guile \xe2\x80\x93 and share the burden between them. Tottenham have a similar number of names on the list \xe2\x80\x93 11 league goalscorers this season \xe2\x80\x93 but were it not for the exceptional return of 19 from Harry Kane their top-four bid would have ended some time ago. Injury or loss of form would leave their squad horribly exposed.</p> <p>So perhaps that is the lesson to take. While Arsenal were beset by a chorus of sprightly attackers they never looked like escaping their habitual fourth-place finish. But with a sprinkle of Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez\xe2\x80\x99s dynamism, a dash of Olivier Giroud\xe2\x80\x99s lumpen charms and a hefty dose of Coquelin\xe2\x80\x99s disciplined solidity a first top-two finish since 2005 (and Patrick Vieira\xe2\x80\x99s departure) looks on the cards. Even \xc3\x96zil has bulked up. A similar selection of disparate talents (Ag\xc3\xbcero and Tour\xc3\xa9, Fellaini and Mata, Diego Costa and Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas) is in evidence in every team in the top four, while the chasing pack have a more one-note group to pick from.</p> <p>The idea of 10 Santi Cazorla\xe2\x80\x99s on a pitch at one time may have great appeal, but as George Lucas found, the attack of the clones is never likely to satisfy.</p> Total goalscorers <p>Arsenal 15</p> <p>Liverpool 14</p> <p>Manchester City 14</p> <p>Chelsea 13</p> <p>Crystal Palace 13</p> <p>Everton 13</p> <p>Newcastle United 13</p> <p>West Ham United 13</p> <p>Leicester City 12</p> <p>Manchester United 12</p> <p>Southampton 12</p> <p>Hull City 11</p> <p>Tottenham Hotspur 11</p> <p>West Bromwich Albion 11</p> <p>Queens Park Rangers 10</p> <p>Aston Villa 8</p> <p>Stoke City 8</p> <p>Sunderland 8</p> <p>Burnley 7</p> <p>Swansea City 7</p>'
