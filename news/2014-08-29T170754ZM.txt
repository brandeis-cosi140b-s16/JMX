b'Manchester City v Stoke City: match preview'


b'<p>Manchester City have denied rumours of an injury in training to Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero but the striker will probably not be in the starting lineup. Even if Ag\xc3\xbcero is not fully fit, Manuel Pellegrini can still call upon Stevan Jovetic, scorer of two goals against Liverpool on Monday, and Edin Dzeko. Stoke also have strength in depth and Victor Moses, signed by Mark Hughes on loan from Chelsea this week, is expected to be on the bench.
