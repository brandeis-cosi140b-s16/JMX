b'<p>Queens Park Rangers should draw encouragement from four points and seven goals in two games on the road over the last week, though their more attacking approach might open the door for Chelsea to revel in the west London derby. Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has no qualms about selecting Nemanja Matic or Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas, both of whom are one booking away from a two-match ban before the weekend cut-off. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need points, we need victories, we cannot choose matches,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. The same applies to the hosts.
