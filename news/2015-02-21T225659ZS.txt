b'Story of the week <p>Chelsea banning five fans from the ground for \xe2\x80\x9cunforgivable actions\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 and extending John Terry\xe2\x80\x99s contract. Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho: \xe2\x80\x9cThat is what the club wants, that\xe2\x80\x99s what John wants, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 2012: Chelsea set out their thinking on JT\xe2\x80\x99s lapse: \xe2\x80\x9cJohn will continue to be captain of this club. We\xe2\x80\x99ve taken disciplinary action and we think it is firm and appropriate action for the circumstances. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a decision taken lightly.\xe2\x80\x9d CEO Ron Gourlay: \xe2\x80\x9cJohn\xe2\x80\x99s played over 550 times for the football club \xe2\x80\xa6 We believe this was an error of judgment. It was out of character for John.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Leading last week\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of the Paris M\xc3\xa9tro story: a) Sepp, advocate of solving racism with handshakes: \xe2\x80\x9cI condemn the actions of a small group of Chelsea fans. There is no place for racism in football.\xe2\x80\x9d And b) Mail Online readers, including Disqusted: \xe2\x80\x9cSeems to me this whole incident was orchestrated for the benefit of the media\xe2\x80\x9d; and ICSENSE: \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t even have a few beers and get on a train without being called a racist anymore.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Meanwhile <p>Rallying round Arrigo Sacchi after his \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not racist but there are too many blacks\xe2\x80\x9d theory caused a row: a) Carlo Ancelotti: \xe2\x80\x9cI give my regards to Arrigo Sacchi. Many enemies, much honour\xe2\x80\x9d; and b) Fabio Capello, with a clarification: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat he said is not racist.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Sacchi\xe2\x80\x99s final word on a rough week: \xe2\x80\x9cThese days just mentioning \xe2\x80\x98black\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98coloured\xe2\x80\x99 has everyone off their leash \xe2\x80\xa6 the moralists, the politically correct. If I haven\xe2\x80\x99t been able to explain myself in 42 years, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to stick around another 20 just to be understood.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Award of the week <p>The annual Issa Hayatou Trophy of Peace \xe2\x80\x93 awarded in the name of Fifa\xe2\x80\x99s head of African football \xe2\x80\x93 presented to a noted \xe2\x80\x9cman of peace, defender of Africa and of young people\xe2\x80\x9d: Equatorial Guinea despot Teodoro Obiang. Organisers praised Obiang for stepping in as last-minute Africa Cup of Nations host, \xe2\x80\x9csaving Africa from unprecedented shame\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> From the boardroom <p>Last week\xe2\x80\x99s FA headliners:</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Nigeria FA president Amaju Pinnick \xe2\x80\x93 who denied his 2014 election win was \xe2\x80\x9cillegal, violent and abusive\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 making a visit to Sepp in Zurich for talks. Fifa.com reported: \xe2\x80\x9cAfter a period of internal instability, [Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s FA] is now looking forward to a busy year.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Ghana FA spokesman Ibrahim Sannie Daara, rejecting financial allegations against his FA in a live radio interview. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone whose aim is to destroy the Black Stars is a witch. There\xe2\x80\x99s a concerted campaign to demonise us. You are going bonkers aren\xe2\x80\x99t you? You are going bonkers.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Record of the week <p>Former Portsmouth CEO Peter Storrie, discussing his new job making Australia\xe2\x80\x99s Central Coast Mariners \xe2\x80\x9ca break-even organisation\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cMy long-term record stands up to scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\xa2 Storrie\xe2\x80\x99s pay at Portsmouth as they headed towards collapse \xe2\x80\x93 2008: \xc2\xa3450k basic plus \xc2\xa3750k bonus; 2009: \xc2\xa3600k basic, \xc2\xa3500k bonus plus \xe2\x80\x9cfootball bonuses\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xa33,000 per win, \xc2\xa31,500 for a draw.</p> Manager news <p>Unveiling of the week: Brazilian club Cene \xe2\x80\x93 founded in 1999 as part of the Moonies\xe2\x80\x99 World Peace and Unification movement - unveiling their new coach to the press while president Jos\xc3\xa9 Rodrigues and vice-president Paulo Telles traded \xe2\x80\x9cgross insults\xe2\x80\x9d in the background. Footage showed the pair \xe2\x80\x9clocked in a power struggle \xe2\x80\xa6 with shouts of \xe2\x80\x98asshole\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98dick\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98jerk\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d. Coach Jo\xc3\xa3o Batista: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m finding this uncomfortable.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>And last week\xe2\x80\x99s exits:</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Argentina: Col\xc3\xb3n president Eduardo Vega weighing up their first game of the season and the impact of coach Reinaldo \xe2\x80\x9cMustard\xe2\x80\x9d Merlo, and sacking him. \xe2\x80\x9cThere were only small differences of opinion, no dramas. But I had to act.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Germany: 20 Jan, Mainz executive Christian Heidel defending Danish coach Kasper Hjulmand\xe2\x80\x99s position. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense to say he\xe2\x80\x99s too quiet and reserved. He\xe2\x80\x99s learning to speak German in record time. Of course when he\xe2\x80\x99s emotional he sticks to basic language, but in training and meetings he\xe2\x80\x99s fine. We\xe2\x80\x99ll soon have him swearing in German.\xe2\x80\x9d 16 Feb: Has him swearing in German.</p> Endorsement of the week <p>Italy: Sampdoria president Massimo Ferrero, asked if his new high-cost signing Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o is \xe2\x80\x9ca rip-off or a champion\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s somewhere in between. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to comment on Eto\xe2\x80\x99o. Eto\xe2\x80\x99o is Eto\xe2\x80\x99o. Mourinho wondered how old he was \xe2\x80\xa6 we haven\xe2\x80\x99t worked that out yet either.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Tidiest marketing <p>Poland: Legia Warsaw\xe2\x80\x99s month so far: a) losing an appeal against a two-game Uefa stadium ban and fine for racist fan violence; and b) launching a new military-themed fan loyalty card system. Legia say fans will earn points to achieve new military ranks as a nod to the club\xe2\x80\x99s history, including \xe2\x80\x9cprivate\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cwarrant officer\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccolonel\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> Faux pax of the week <p>Argentina: Boca fans, looking to intimidate opponents before their Copa Libertadores game against Palestino, stoning their own team\xe2\x80\x99s bus by mistake.
