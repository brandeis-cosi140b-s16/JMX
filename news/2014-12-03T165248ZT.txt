b'THE REST IS VERY TRAUMATIC OR VERY AMUSING HISTORY <p>Ah, 1990, such a long time ago. No one had even thought of satirical tea-time emails back then. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a Fiver, though. Instead it was either sent out to its tens of readers by horse and cart, ensuring that it would arrive at its destination 26 days late, or by carrier pigeon for those lucky readers who had taken out a gold subscription membership. They could expect to receive their daily dose of biting satire merely 13 days after it was sent out and how happy they were. At least, that\xe2\x80\x99s what we had to assume. By the time complaints reached Fiver Towers about, say, The Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s tardiness or its lack of quality or its cynical take on Paul Gascoigne\xe2\x80\x99s tears at the World Cup, it was 1993 and the world had moved on. No one cared. What a time to be alive. 1993. Simpler times.</p> <p>But anyway, back to 1990. Did you know that was the last time that Liverpool won the league title? Well you do now! They haven\xe2\x80\x99t won it since then and it\xe2\x80\x99s been a frustrating 24 years for Liverpool. Mostly it has not been much fun, at least not until last season. They were fun last season and they were good and the wait was going to come to an end and YOU\xe2\x80\x99LL NEVER WALK ALONE and ... the rest is very traumatic or very amusing history depending on your allegiances. Liverpool did not win the league and although Steven Gerrard hauled himself off the floor after giving the ball to Demba Ba, this season has not gone to plan for him so far, to the extent that people have been wondering out loud whether he should be given a new contract. The cheek of it! Don\xe2\x80\x99t these fools know that he won the Big Cup? In 2005? Nine years ago? Exactly.</p> <p>Heaven forbid that the theory should be put forward that a 34-year-old midfielder who is no longer the rampaging force of old ought to be ushered out of the Anfield door when his current deal runs out in the summer. It\xe2\x80\x99s an outrage but, luckily, Gerrard was on hand to silence the critics last night by doing a goal against high-flying Leicester City, which changes everything. It certainly did for Michael Owen, the BT Sport co-commentator claiming that Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s game-changing heroics proved that the criticism has been \xe2\x80\x9claughable\xe2\x80\x9d and was reason enough to give him the man of the match award. Even if the performance of Wes Morgan at the heart of Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s defence was far more influential in a win for Liverpool that gets their season right back on track until the next crisis.</p> <p>It sure is easy to be wise after the event, something The Fiver discovered when it thought that Dress Down Friday meant coming to work topless \xe2\x80\x93 we can still remember the screams. Southampton have also been on the receiving end since Sunday. Champions elect before being smashed by the minnows of Manchester City at St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s, now people are queuing up to say that they knew that Southampton were never that good anyway, probably going down actually, it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to come to any other conclusion after a dismal one-match losing streak. Tonight Ronald Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s relegation strugglers go to Arsenal who, like Liverpool, are back after winning two games on the bounce, one against the Bundesliga\xe2\x80\x99s bottom side, the other against West Bromwich Albion.</p> <p>But now Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger is mulling over the possibility of unbeaten Chelsea being caught at the top of the league, Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s manager pointing out that the six-point gap between them and City isn\xe2\x80\x99t really that big. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter 13 or 14 games, you cannot say that the title race is over,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho does not seem that bothered, though, Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s manager content with landing one on Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Invincibles instead. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not playing for that,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said when he was asked if Chelsea are planning on losing any games. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause, if you play for that and that is one of your objectives, maybe you draw too many matches because you don\xe2\x80\x99t take risks to try and win matches.\xe2\x80\x9d So, with City travelling to Sunderland, their bogey team, confirmation arrives that Chelsea will try to win against Tottenham Hotspur at Stamford Bridge, where the visitors have not won since 1990. Could this be the year? Has the Tottenham masterplan been to lull Chelsea into a false sense of security, wait for the right moment and then pounce?</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Jacob Steinberg from 7.45pm for Arsenal 1-2 Southampton and, for updates from all of tonight\xe2\x80\x99s other matches, point your peepers in the direction of Scott Murray\xe2\x80\x99s clockwatch.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFrance is hypocritical, cowardly.

I\xe2\x80\x99ll happily confess that I\xe2\x80\x99ve even been known to laugh at The Fiver in the presence of others.

If he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like what he sees, then don\xe2\x80\x99t bother coming.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>A Borussia Dortmund suit has come out and said that the story claiming Real Madrid have first dibs on Marco Reus is as rubbish as reality TV. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is complete nonsense that there is an option right agreement. Marco alone will decide where he will go,\xe2\x80\x9d said suit sniffed.</p> <p>Mr Em wanted to join Leicester last week but this week he wants to join Bolton after turning up for training. He could form a sprightly partnership with Eidur Gudjohnsen. The duo would have a combined age of 72.</p> <p>After telling Bertie Vogts to do one, Azerbaijan have leafed through the CVs of Roberto Mancini, Martin Jol and Slaven Bilic and plumped for, eh, Robert Prosinecki.</p> <p>And Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho says it\xe2\x80\x99s time the public understood what players go through. \xe2\x80\x9cWe couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even fly back to London [from Sunderland last week] by plane because of the fog.

Or maybe none of them. The Mill has its suspicions.</p> <p>Does $tevie Mbe deserves a new contract? Yes, says Paul Wilson.
