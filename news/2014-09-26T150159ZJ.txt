b'<p>Perhaps Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger was just making excuses for the perceived under-performance of his \xc2\xa342m World Cup-winning midfielder when he tried to place Mesut \xc3\x96zil in the context of the modern game the other day. Or maybe he really believed what he was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot put responsibility on one player to be a magician,\xe2\x80\x9d he claimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat does not exist any more in the modern game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>A cynic would say that Wenger has spent the past nine years, trophyless until May\xe2\x80\x99s scratchy FA Cup victory over Hull City, trying to prove his point by fielding a team devoid of magicians. What he succeeded in demonstrating was that without a Dennis Bergkamp or a Thierry Henry, all the teamwork in the world can lead nowhere.</p> <p>Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s vision of the \xe2\x80\x9cmodern game\xe2\x80\x9d seemed to strike at the heart of an enduring belief that football is as much about individuals as teams. Why else would the genius of a Tom Finney or an Alfredo Di St\xc3\xa9fano, a George Best or a Diego Maradona, give such pleasure to fans owing no allegiance to the clubs or nations those players represented?</p> <p>A club manager \xe2\x80\x93 and Wenger is as blinkered as any in this respect \xe2\x80\x93 cannot be expected to take the wider view. But football is about much more than tribal loyalty. It is also about the enjoyment of individual brilliance made manifest in a moment of extreme skill or uncanny perceptiveness, those moments at which we are tempted to discuss the sport in terms of art.</p> <p>There was a perfect example this summer at the World Cup when James Rodr\xc3\xadguez, his back to goal, took a headed pass on his chest, swivelled and hooked a 25-yard volley into the Uruguayan net with a simple elegance that made a piece of high skill look effortless. It turned Colombia\xe2\x80\x99s No10 into an international star overnight, even though a previous goal, the shimmy and chip in the last minute of the group match against Japan, had been just as exceptional and pleasing to the eye, if less obviously spectacular.</p> <p>A manager, however, is more likely to be sent into raptures by a goal that demonstrates the effect of coaching on team play. It is hard to imagine there will be much that gives Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho greater pleasure this year than the move that gave Chelsea a 1-1 draw with Manchester City. Involving six members of the team, it took 18 seconds from C\xc3\xa9sar Azpilicueta\xe2\x80\x99s headed clearance deep inside his own penalty area to Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle\xe2\x80\x99s shot, featuring not just a cunningly-shaped 70-yard scamper by the scorer to meet Eden Hazard\xe2\x80\x99s perfect square ball on the edge of City\xe2\x80\x99s six-yard box, but one of the passes of the season earlier in the move when Hazard, wide on the right, turned back inside his marker to hit the curving crossfield ball that triggered the final phase of a classic counterattack.</p> <p>That pass was hit with the Belgian\xe2\x80\x99s left foot. The cross was delivered, 10 seconds later and 50 yards further up the pitch, with his right. In real time such details could not be fully appreciated, but they make the goal a pleasure to watch over and over again, as a tribute to Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s obsession with drilling his players in the art of swift transition.</p> <p>But was that sequence, with its astonishing blend of spontaneity and precision, as thrilling as the moment of outrageous individual opportunism in Parma two weekends ago when J\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9my M\xc3\xa9nez\xe2\x80\x99s strike for Milan gave the season one of the moments for which it will be remembered?</p> <p>The last of Milan\xe2\x80\x99s goals in a 5-4 victory, it came after Parma had pulled back from 1-3 down to 3-4. They must have been feeling reasonably confident, given that Pippo Inzaghi\xe2\x80\x99s defence would continue to offer them chances. But when Stefan Ristovski got in a mix-up with his captain, Alessandro Lucarelli, on the right-hand side of the defence and played a tentative back-pass that left his goalkeeper, Antonio Mirante, unsure whether to stick or twist, Milan\xe2\x80\x99s France international nipped in to touch the ball past the keeper and chase it as it rolled across the face of the goal, a yard and a half from the line.</p> <p>It was what M\xc3\xa9nez did when he reached it that had the spectators gasping in disbelief. Still running at full speed, and with Mirante and a couple of defenders closing on him, he managed to execute a sharp right-footed backheel that angled the ball outside his own left leg and inside the right-hand post.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cA great player is someone who makes his team win,\xe2\x80\x9d Wenger said earlier in his time at Arsenal. \xe2\x80\x9cAnything else is just talk.\xe2\x80\x9d M\xc3\xa9nez had struck the decisive blow from which his team\xe2\x80\x99s opponents could not recover. He had also given a rather depressed Serie A, and the world of football as a whole, something to cherish.</p> <p>Then on Tuesday, after an hour of a match in France\xe2\x80\x99s first division, with the visitors, Marseille, leading Stade de Reims by three goals on the way to a 5-0 victory, Andr\xc3\xa9 Ayew, the Ghana forward, scored his second of the night with another flash of brilliance. A cross-shot from Florian Thauvin, Marseille\xe2\x80\x99s right-winger, came back off the hand of Johnny Placide, the home side\xe2\x80\x99s Haiti goalkeeper, and into the path of Ayew, who wrapped his left foot around the back of his right leg to prod the loose ball past the keeper\xe2\x80\x99s dive from six yards out.</p> <p>It was only in replays that the meaning of Ayew\xe2\x80\x99s moment of virtuosity became apparent. Not only is his left foot the stronger of the two, but in the split second available to him a shot with his right foot would probably have hit the goalkeeper. He had found a practical solution that happens to possess a balletic beauty: a trick known as the rabona, first used to score a goal, so it is said, by the Estudiantes forward Beto Infante \xe2\x80\x93 with the right foot, in his case \xe2\x80\x93 in an Argentinian league match against Rosario Central in 1948.</p> <p>Football is a permanent battle between inspiration and functionality, and the game could not do without its exponents of the more basic arts. The likes of Tommy Smith, Dunga and Javier Mascherano will never go short of unstinted veneration from the fans of teams for whose goalscorers they have provided a solid platform. But the moments that stick in the collective memory are produced by the magicians: a Puskas drag-back, a George Best feint-and-dart, or a Van Basten volley. And now, even in the modern game, a M\xc3\xa9nez backheel and an Ayew rabona.</p>'
