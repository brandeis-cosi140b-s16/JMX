b'England call up Jamie Vardy and Charlie Austin for Ireland and Slovenia matches'


b'<p>The strikers Jamie Vardy and Charlie Austin and the goalkeeper Tom Heaton have received their first England call-ups. The trio are part of Roy Hodgson\xe2\x80\x99s squad for the friendly in the Republic of Ireland on 7 June and the Euro 2016 qualifier in Slovenia seven days later.</p> <p>The Queens Park Rangers striker Austin had been widely expected to make the squad but the call-ups for Leicester City\xe2\x80\x99s Vardy and Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s Heaton are more eye-catching.</p> <p>Vardy has finished the season strongly, helping Leicester to secure Premier League survival with three goals in his past nine matches and a series of impressive performances. The 28-year-old, who was playing non-league football for Fleetwood as recently as April 2012, had scored only once for Leicester all season \xe2\x80\x93 against Manchester United \xe2\x80\x93 before beginning his recent purple patch in late March.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that players who have that pace and that desire to run in behind players are always interesting for coaches,\xe2\x80\x9d Hodgson said of Vardy.</p>  <p> Related: Raheem Sterling agent: winger \xe2\x80\x98wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t sign Liverpool deal for \xc2\xa3900k a week\xe2\x80\x99 </p>   <p>Austin, who also came through the non-league route, has scored 17 goals this season for a relegated QPR side. He and Vardy join Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck as the strikers in Hodgson\xe2\x80\x99s squad. Welbeck is included despite concerns over a knee injury and Rooney is selected even though he missed Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s draw against Arsenal last week with a dead leg.</p> <p>With Harry Kane in the Under-21s and Daniel Sturridge out through injury, the England manager has offered chances to Austin and Vardy.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve always had our eye on Charlie Austin but up to this point we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a full quota of front players and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99ve had the space there,\xe2\x80\x9d Hodgson said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll give him every chance to show what he can do in training and maybe in the matches. We can\xe2\x80\x99t promise that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Heaton has also been part of a relegated team, at Burnley. He provides back-up for England to Joe Hart and Robert Green.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very pleased with the squad we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to put together here, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a very strong squad,\xe2\x80\x9d Hodgson said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn particular I\xe2\x80\x99m very pleased to welcome three people who haven\xe2\x80\x99t been with us before but who get the chance, to some extent because of the Under-21s, because quite often we\xe2\x80\x99ve used some of those players in our squad and it\xe2\x80\x99s given them the opportunity.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFor people like Tom Heaton and Jamie Vardy and Charlie Austin I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a good opportunity for them to have a chance to come and show us what they can do and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone would deny them the right to be there because they have had very good seasons with their clubs quite often in difficult situations.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Arsenal midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has been left out because of hamstring and groin issues. Hodgson has opted against calling up Ashley Young despite the winger\xe2\x80\x99s excellent recent form for Manchester United.</p> <p>The Tottenham midfielder Ryan Mason, who made his debut against Italy in March, keeps his place, as does Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s Ryan Bertrand, with Everton\xe2\x80\x99s Leighton Baines injured.</p> <p>The Aston Villa midfielder Fabian Delph remains in the squad and is likely to feature in the double-header as Michael Carrick is absent with a calf injury.</p> <p>Raheem Sterling, whose future has become the source of much debate recently, is included in the 24-man party. But Hodgson refused to comment on the player\xe2\x80\x99s stand-off with Liverpool: \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t be sticking my nose into that business at all.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>There has been no place in England\xe2\x80\x99s full or Under-21 squads for Jack Grealish, who has turned down a call-up from the Republic of Ireland and is eligible for both countries.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s important that we leave it to him,\xe2\x80\x9d Hodgson said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a very talented player and has been on the radar for our Under-21 teams. He could play for either country, which one\xe2\x80\x99s it going to be? As far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned it\xe2\x80\x99s got to be Jack\xe2\x80\x99s decision and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we should be putting undue influence on him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> England squad <p>Goalkeepers Rob Green (QPR), Joe Hart (Manchester City), Tom Heaton (Burnley)</p> <p>Defenders Ryan Bertrand (Southampton), Gary Cahill (Chelsea), Nathaniel Clyne (Southampton), Kieran Gibbs (Arsenal), Phil Jagielka (Everton), Phil Jones (Manchester United), Chris Smalling (Manchester United)</p> <p>Midfielders Ross Barkley (Everton), Fabian Delph (Aston Villa), Jordan Henderson (Liverpool), Adam Lallana (Liverpool), Ryan Mason (Tottenham Hotspur), James Milner (Manchester City), Raheem Sterling (Liverpool), Andros Townsend (Tottenham Hotspur), Theo Walcott (Arsenal), Jack Wilshere (Arsenal)</p> <p>Forwards Charlie Austin (QPR), Wayne Rooney (Manchester United), Jamie Vardy (Leicester City) Danny Welbeck (Arsenal).</p>'
