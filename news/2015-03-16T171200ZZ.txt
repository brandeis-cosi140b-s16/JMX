b'Zlatan Ibrahimovic told to leave France by Front National leader Marine Le Pen'


b'<p>Zlatan Ibrahimovic has been forced to apologise after sparking a political row by attacking a referee and calling France a \xe2\x80\x9cshit country\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Politicians waded into the Paris Saint-Germain player with Marine Le Pen of the far-right Front National telling the Swedish striker that if he did not like France he could leave. Ibrahimovic will face a Professional Football League disciplinary hearing on Thursday.</p> <p>In the corridor after the match, which PSG lost to Bordeaux 3-2, a furious Ibrahimovic was caught on film swearing and railing against the referee.</p> <p>He can be clearly heard shouting in English: \xe2\x80\x9cWake up, wake up \xe2\x80\xa6 we\xe2\x80\x99re not amateurs. Fucking asshole. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen this in my 15 years playing football. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been playing for 15 years and I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen [good] refereeing in this shit country. They don\xe2\x80\x99t even deserve PSG in this country.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Le Pen, whose party is expected to make important gains in local elections, told radio listeners on Monday: \xe2\x80\x9cThose who consider that France is a shit country can leave it. There. It\xe2\x80\x99s as simple as that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Asked if the football authorities should discipline Ibrahimovic, Le Pen replied: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the least they could do\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>The striker\xe2\x80\x99s outburst brought opprobrium across the political spectrum. The French sports minister, Patrick Kanner, tweeted: \xe2\x80\x9cIbrahimovic\xe2\x80\x99s disappointment doesn\xe2\x80\x99t justify his insults towards the referee and the country that has welcomed him. He should apologise.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>J\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xb4me Guedj, an MP with the governing Socialist Party, said: \xe2\x80\x9cLet him play football and shut up, or at least show some respect towards this country and football supporters who were also insulted.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ibrahimovic said his remarks were directed at the referee Lionel Jaffredo and insisted he was not targeting \xe2\x80\x9cFrance or the French\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI spoke about football. I lost the game, I accept that, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t accept when the referee doesn\xe2\x80\x99t follow the rules. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the first time and I\xe2\x80\x99m sick of it. My sincere apologies if anyone was offended, or took it the wrong way,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote.</p>           Zlatan Ibrahimovic apologises    <p>In his defence, Ibrahimovic said he had lost his temper. \xe2\x80\x9cI was angry. Everyone knows in that situation they often say things without thinking. I apologise if people felt offended.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In a front-page headline, Le Parisian newspaper described Ibrahimovic\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour as \xe2\x80\x9cunacceptable\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Ibrahimovic scored twice but PSG\xe2\x80\x99s defeat mean they trail Lyon by two points at the top of Ligue 1. The striker was angered when Jaffredo failed to award PSG a free-kick after the Bordeaux goalkeeper C\xc3\xa9dric Carrasso picked up a back pass from the defender Ludovic San\xc3\xa9.</p> <p>His outburst came less than a week after he accused Chelsea players of acting \xe2\x80\x9clike babies\xe2\x80\x9d after he was sent off during PSG\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League victory on away goals.</p> <p>On France-Info radio, Le Pen refused to comment further except to suggest Ibrahimovic could leave France, saying there were \xe2\x80\x9cmore important things to discuss\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>In the past, the FN leader has said \xe2\x80\x9cfootball\xe2\x80\x99s not really my thing\xe2\x80\x9d, but that has not stopped her making remarks about the players in the national \xe2\x80\x9cblack, blanc, beur\xe2\x80\x9d (black, white, Arab) team, that have caused outrage.</p> <p>In 2010, Le Pen told BFMTV that she did not \xe2\x80\x9cidentify with\xe2\x80\x9d the French national football team because certain players had \xe2\x80\x9canother nationality at heart\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf they behave correctly \xe2\x80\xa6 if we hear, even occasionally, from the mouths of these players talk of [their] patriotism, if a few stop refusing to sing the Marseillaise, if we don\xe2\x80\x99t see them wrapped in the flags of other countries than our own, maybe things will change, but I have to say that I don\xe2\x80\x99t identify particularly with this team,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.</p>'
