b"Daniel Sturridge: \xe2\x80\x98People look at footballers as being flashy, but we\xe2\x80\x99re hard-working. We just do fewer hours'"


b'<p>It makes sense that off-duty footballers should dress brashly. They pass their professional lives in club-chosen suits and ties, wear matching trackies for training and then all that glowing polyester for games. It\xe2\x80\x99s not surprising then that Daniel Sturridge, the 25-year-old Liverpool and England striker, seems to relish an afternoon in a room full of snappy, distinctive menswear. On racks in the Merseyside studio hang oversized rollnecks and dimpled bomber jackets, a creaking, patent leather coat that won\xe2\x80\x99t quite fasten around Sturridge\xe2\x80\x99s broad-shouldered 6ft 2in frame. \xe2\x80\x9cIn fashion you express yourself however you want,\xe2\x80\x9d he tells me (going with the rollneck). \xe2\x80\x9cYou express your personality.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>More so than in football?</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYeah. Because in football you can be misunderstood. People have a perception of you without knowing you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>This has to be written with some caution, about a sport in which various top practitioners, at least from this armchair fan\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, come across as humming narcissists with no discernible taste, but Sturridge is cool. His lightly accented Brum is tuned, as a rule, to a low volume. He\xe2\x80\x99s reflective, pausing before answering questions, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t smile easily. He carries himself a little differently, a fact that has been noted. Last spring, just before the World Cup (a tournament at which Sturridge gave the England team its first goal and only highlight of a short-lived campaign), online magazine Vice anointed him \xe2\x80\x9cfootball\xe2\x80\x99s first hipster\xe2\x80\x9d. Though their reasoning amounted, in the end, to his liking for brimmed hats and the voguish musician Banks (\xe2\x80\x9ca goddess\xe2\x80\x9d), these choices were worth praising nonetheless. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the age of soul-garroting media training and dull as fuck sponsorship campaigns\xe2\x80\xa6 someone like Sturridge is at least brightening things up a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The opinion seemed especially sound after England were knocked out of the World Cup, and Sturridge responded by posting a curious video on Instagram, a little visual poem that showed his sad frown, then a coconut impaled with a straw, then a desolate Brazilian beach. As a statement it was better than \xe2\x80\x9cthe lads are gutted\xe2\x80\x9d, I thought. Did he read the Vice article? \xe2\x80\x9cI did,\xe2\x80\x9d Sturridge says. \xe2\x80\x9cI was a bit flattered.\xe2\x80\x9d He leaves the matter there.</p>     Bomber jacket, \xc2\xa3345, by PS by Paul Smith, from matchesfashion.com.

Photograph: Desmond Muckian for the Guardian    <p>We talk in his dressing room, between shots, the footballer periodically going outside to have his picture taken before returning to haul off a splatter-print top by Marc Jacobs for something plainer by McQueen. Underneath the jumpers he wears a thick tangle of neck chains, including a couple of crosses studded with diamonds. And\xe2\x80\xa6 are those glow-in-the-dark rosary beads?</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYeah. I always pray. I\xe2\x80\x99m quite religious. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had the beads since I can remember.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Why glow-in-the-dark?</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re scared at night, as a kid, they make you feel safe. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always worn them. I feel lost without them, to be honest. They\xe2\x80\x99re only plastic but once, when I was on holiday, they came off in the pool without me knowing. I\xe2\x80\x99ve not let that happen again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Those diamond crosses look more expensive.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve lost a couple of these, too. Usually I like to keep a piece of jewellery on me when I\xe2\x80\x99m playing. Not around my neck, because that\xe2\x80\x99s banned. I used to tuck [a diamond cross] in my sock. I was playing for Manchester City at the time, or it might have been Chelsea, and it came out on the pitch.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Where did it end up?</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSomeone\xe2\x80\x99s hands, obviously! It was pricey.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>So let\xe2\x80\x99s not get carried away; he has his flash side. Earlier in the month Sturridge extended his contract with Liverpool, a new deal thought to put his wages at something like \xc2\xa3150,000 a week. He drove to the photoshoot in a growling Porsche Panamera (drawing hoots from a gang of metalworkers) and his concern for dressing precisely could be interpreted, if you were minded to do so, as preening. Off the plane at last summer\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup, the first thing Sturridge did in his hotel room was get out a steam iron.</p> <p>The first thing?</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHad to. Can\xe2\x80\x99t go out with crushed clothes. Can\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>What does that say about his character?</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat I was raised well?\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Scribble sweatshirt, \xc2\xa3170, by Marc by Marc Jacobs, from liberty.co.uk. Styling: Melanie Wilkinson. Photograph: Desmond Muckian for the Guardian    <p>He laughs \xe2\x80\x93 and the room laughs along. Present at the photoshoot are Sturridge\xe2\x80\x99s agent and a couple of representatives from his chief sponsor, Nike. The footballer is obviously close with this circle (there\xe2\x80\x99s a round of cheerful teasing about a photo of Sturridge, circulated to celebrate his big contract-signing, that showed him hovering a pen over a blank piece of paper) but he arrived at the studio alone, and makes it clear that if he has anything resembling an entourage, it\xe2\x80\x99s his immediate family. Mum Grace, a cook. Dad Michael, a retired footballer turned scout. A brother and sister.</p> <p>When Michael Sturridge signed a deal that first took his youngest son to Manchester City, back in 2003, the entire family relocated from Birmingham to live in Congleton, near City\xe2\x80\x99s academy. Did he feel guilty about the family uprooting itself?</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAt the time I didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know they were doing it for me. I was 13 when we left. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to think your whole family are moving for you, personally.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Does he think about it differently now?</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOf course. Of course. I\xe2\x80\x99m grateful. I can\xe2\x80\x99t repay them. They always say: you don\xe2\x80\x99t need to. But you feel like there\xe2\x80\x99s an onus to repay them. But you can\xe2\x80\x99t really do that with money.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Has he tried?</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy mum, she loves a bargain hunt. You can\xe2\x80\x99t buy her anything expensive. I remember I bought her a diamond bracelet for her birthday. I was being a nice son! She told me to take it back. I asked her if she was joking. She said: I don\xe2\x80\x99t want it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>She sounds formidable.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFormidable, yeah\xe2\x80\xa6 At the World Cup I carried my mum\xe2\x80\x99s Caribbean sauce around with me. She makes her own and I brought it to Brazil \xe2\x80\x93 I needed to have it there. We\xe2\x80\x99re very down-to-earth; it\xe2\x80\x99s the nature of my family. We came from nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It was Sturridge\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather who moved the family to Birmingham from Jamaica. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was thinking: opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d Within a generation there was a Sturridge on Match Of The Day \xe2\x80\x93 Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s uncle Dean, a prolific goalscorer for Derby County. Michael, Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s dad, played for Birmingham City\xe2\x80\x99s reserves. I ask Sturridge if he remembers a lot of football chat at family gatherings.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNot really. At the time, it was [talk about] crime. \xe2\x80\x98Oh-my-God someone got this done to them.\xe2\x80\x99 Robberies.\xe2\x80\x9d Their part of Birmingham, Hockley, was troubled then. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of gun crime, drug selling. Every city\xe2\x80\x99s got rough areas. For me, Birmingham is home.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Does he go back?</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAlways. You go there now and see young guys, looking over thinking: \xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s that, in that car?\xe2\x80\x99 And that was me! When I was younger. That was me, looking at someone in a new car. I\xe2\x80\x99m one of them and they don\xe2\x80\x99t realise it. If you grow up in a rough area, there\xe2\x80\x99s only certain things you think you can become. Everyone wants to be a footballer. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have many saying doctor, or lawyer, because they don\xe2\x80\x99t think they can become that. People have to realise they can be anything in life.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Except, in all likelihood, a footballer. The odds are minuscule. Was he aware of that as a child?</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s enjoyment at that age. You\xe2\x80\x99re a kid, you\xe2\x80\x99re more worried about having fun with your mates than making it as a professional. At a young age \xe2\x80\x93 honestly? \xe2\x80\x93 I wanted to be a wrestler. It\xe2\x80\x99s true. That was my dream, to be a wrestler, and I genuinely believed I could do it. I loved the Undertaker, the Ultimate Warrior\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d better leave you while you change,\xe2\x80\x9d I say.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was thinking that,\xe2\x80\x9d says Sturridge, laughing. With the ease of a man who has spent his life in congested dressing rooms, he was climbing out of a pair of designer sweatpants \xe2\x80\x93 only pausing mid-drop to consider the etiquette. \xe2\x80\x9cYou sitting there on the sofa,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a bit weird.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Burgundy rollneck, \xc2\xa3195, by Gant Rugger, from mrporter.com.

Photograph: Desmond Muckian for the Guardian    <p>Away from Sturridge\xe2\x80\x99s dressing room, I speak on the phone to one of his oldest friends in football, Micah Richards. Both were born in the same Birmingham hospital, and both spent their teens at Manchester City. Richards first met Sturridge when the striker was at the end of his I-want-to-be-a-wrestler phase, beginning to inch towards the Premier League. Richards was a defender and he remembers encountering a kid, on day one, who came with baggage.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHis uncle Dean had a big name in the game at the time, so [Daniel] had a reputation to live up to.\xe2\x80\x9d And did he impress? \xe2\x80\x9cI knew from the first day I trained with him,\xe2\x80\x9d Richards says, \xe2\x80\x9che was going to be what he is now. The only thing I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit disappointed with is that it\xe2\x80\x99s took him so long.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Richards recently moved from Manchester to play in Italy, for Fiorentina. The pair remain good friends and every Friday, Richards tells me, they engage in playful rap battles using a messenger app on their phones. Richards knows better than to try to call Sturridge for an actual chat in the runup to the weekend. \xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t answer his phone the day and night before a game,\xe2\x80\x9d says Richards, chuckling. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t score a goal, he won\xe2\x80\x99t speak to you after it, either.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In the long, unpredictable game of snakes and ladders that is a career in football, the friends have yet to excel at the same time. For a long time it was Richards, installed at a young age in Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s first team, who got the critical raves and the international call-ups. Sturridge sat through matches on the bench or played for the reserves. He left City for Chelsea in 2009 but there, too, spent a lot of time on the sidelines. It was only after a move to Liverpool last year, and a 25-goal season, that he became a star. By which time Richards was out of favour in England and ready to move abroad.</p>     Splatter print jumper, \xc2\xa3210, by Marc by Marc Jacobs, from matchesfashion.com. Coat, \xc2\xa3100, asos.com. Sweatpants, \xc2\xa355, nike.com. Styling: Melanie Wilkinson. Photograph: Desmond Muckian for the Guardian    <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s not a secure life. I ask Richards if conversation between the friends is ever awkward, their fortunes seesawing, and he tells me no \xe2\x80\x93 footballers aren\xe2\x80\x99t like that. Football isn\xe2\x80\x99t like that. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s rough with the smooth,\xe2\x80\x9d says Richards. Sturridge says: \xe2\x80\x9cEverything comes and goes.\xe2\x80\x9d He impresses it on me during our afternoon together that top-end football isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite the round-the-clock glamour festival I seem to assume. A hat-trick, a post-match massage, then a night out on chilled premium brand? Not if you want to play next time.</p> <p>The English league demands such a degree of athleticism now that first-teamers can\xe2\x80\x99t easily afford to piss around in their spare time. As Richards puts it: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you go out twice a week, and go out late, you get found out in the stats.\xe2\x80\x9d Admittedly, Sturridge says, they have their fun. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody has their hobbies\xe2\x80\xa6 some people have their vices.\xe2\x80\x9d But he talks me through an average mid-season day in his life.</p> <p>After the 8am alarm there\xe2\x80\x99s a 15-minute drive to the training ground. Maybe a club-made omelette before a morning of training, or gym work, or both. He\xe2\x80\x99s home and done by the early afternoon. Then? \xe2\x80\x9cOn the couch. Near enough the whole rest of the day. Watching DVDs.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>That\xe2\x80\x99s hours!</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYeah. There\xe2\x80\x99s an argument to say: keep yourself occupied. Do something. But what about my legs, and them getting tired? It\xe2\x80\x99s important to put your feet up, not be walking around. Come Saturday you\xe2\x80\x99ll be tired without knowing it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>I put it to Sturridge he must be rare. Other players aren\xe2\x80\x99t putting in the same amount of sofa time, are they? \xe2\x80\x9cRare? No. The majority of footballers are the same. People look at footballers as being flashy, but we\xe2\x80\x99re [hard-working] people, too. Others work nine to five \xe2\x80\x93 we just do less hours. What do you do?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>I work nine to five.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAnd after that?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>I go home. Help put my kid to bed. Have dinner and watch an episode of something. Bed.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSame as me! Without the kid.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Rose-sleeve sweatshirt, \xc2\xa3150, by Our Legacy, from mrporter.com.

At least as recently as the spring, Sturridge was with a model, Jourdan Dunn. He mentions a previous long-term relationship that lasted five years but \xe2\x80\x9cyou end up moving on, becoming single. There\xe2\x80\x99ll come a time when I\xe2\x80\x99ll settle down and be with someone again. For now I\xe2\x80\x99m focused on my job.\xe2\x80\x9d I ask if girlfriends have to pass any sort of mum test \xe2\x80\x93 if there\xe2\x80\x99s a family-entourage filter \xe2\x80\x93 and Sturridge looks at me as if I haven\xe2\x80\x99t understood him at all. \xe2\x80\x9cThey ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to bed with your partner,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s got nothing to do with them. It\xe2\x80\x99s about someone who has a bond with you. Someone who makes you feel like you can be whatever you want to be in life.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Not long ago, Sturridge had a thought along these lines, about the sort of woman he found attractive, and he tapped out a few words for Twitter. \xe2\x80\x9cNeed an ambitious lady with inner beauty,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. The tweet made headlines in three newspapers. \xe2\x80\x9cSturridge is looking for love,\xe2\x80\x9d was the Mirror\xe2\x80\x99s take, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want a Wag.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>For all his talk about living a near-enough average life, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. His banged-out Twitter aphorisms get half a page in the paper. Last summer he achieved the most elemental of playground ambitions, scoring a cracking goal in a World Cup, and when I get a cab from the Merseyside studio I pass Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s stadium where a 20m-high poster of Sturridge, in all his glowing-polyester glory, hangs on an exterior wall. Over the course of our afternoon together he\xe2\x80\x99ll have earned my annual salary, more or less.</p> <p>Still, he is keen to stress the basic limitations of his world, the DVD marathons on the couch and his mother\xe2\x80\x99s Caribbean sauce, not the payslips or the Porsche (the make of which I have to prise out of him). He\xe2\x80\x99ll cheerfully admit to wearing glow-in-the-dark rosary beads to allay ancient childhood fears. Sturridge underplays his lot \xe2\x80\x93 and that\xe2\x80\x99s rare for a footballer, I think.</p>'
