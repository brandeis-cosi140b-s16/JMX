b'\xc2\xa3725m <p>With a day of trading to go, the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s grip on financial reality has never been more relaxed. Driven by the \xc2\xa35.5bn TV deal, clubs\xe2\x80\x99 spending in this window has already passed \xc2\xa3725m, with \xc2\xa3360m spent in the first two months alone.
