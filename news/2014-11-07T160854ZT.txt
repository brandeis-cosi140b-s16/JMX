b'The Fiver | This hypothetical success'


b'LOUIS VG <p>With his One Flew Over The Cuckoo\xe2\x80\x99s Nest hair, cast-iron self-regard and heroic indifference to what anyone else thinks of him, Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has always inspired something resembling awe in the Fiver. So it was with some disappointment that we learned that the Louis which addressed the press pack today before his side\xe2\x80\x99s failure to beat Crystal Palace at home tomorrow afternoon was a rather chastened, hitherto unseen version of the Dutchman, far removed from the Louis who famously dropped his trews in front of a group of players so they could have an unobstructed view of exactly the kind of big swingers he thought they were lacking.</p> <p>No, today\xe2\x80\x99s version was an unrecognisably contrite version, Louis opting to demonstrate something resembling humility as he announced he\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfeeling lousy for everyone that we have 13 points from 10 games, but we are in a process\xe2\x80\x9d. However, in a return to the heartwarming bullishness with which his audience is more accustomed, Louis did at least point out to all present that, contrary to popular opinion, his injury-ravaged, inexperienced and occasionally slapstick defence is actually tighter than that of the Premier League leaders, making the very salient point that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you don\xe2\x80\x99t count the five goals of Leicester City, we have [conceded] less than Chelsea\xe2\x80\x9d. Sadly, he missed a trick by failing to follow up with the revelation that when you also don\xe2\x80\x99t count the two goals of Swansea, the one goal of Sunderland, one or both of the two goals of West Brom, the one goal of Chelsea and the one goal of Manchester City, his team are unbeaten and sitting pretty on top of the Premier League!</p> <p>Even in the face of this hypothetical success, Louis insists there\xe2\x80\x99s even more actual success to come, although it might take the length of his contract. \xe2\x80\x9cI said from the beginning that the process shall take more than one year \xe2\x80\x93 it will take three years,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope, because that is always dependent on a lot of things. I think when we make it happen that we\xe2\x80\x99ll win a lot of matches in a row.\xe2\x80\x9d Having thus far steered United to victory in two matches in a row just once and one match in a row just twice, Van Gaal must be grateful that football club owners and patrons are famously renowned for their serenity and patience in the face of poor results. If he\xe2\x80\x99s in any doubt, he can just reflect on what happened to David Moyes.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not as if I was brought up on the carpet. We did an evaluation but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the impression I needed to get down on my knees. That\xe2\x80\x99s not how it went down. It was said we needed to do a sharp evaluation and I had no problem with that\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Holland coach Guus Hiddink vows to resign if his side slump to defeat against Latvia next week, after the recent humiliation in Iceland.</p>     Guus Hiddink gets his carpet chat on.

I think anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s seen Warnock\xe2\x80\x99s teams play football over the last 10 years would wager he\xe2\x80\x99s been boring for some time\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ferg Slade.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was surprised to find that no pedants appeared to take issue with Gerry Wall\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that \xe2\x80\x98all types of toilet tissues\xe2\x80\x99 come in rectangles (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters). Having been perfectly placed while reading said assertion to perform an immediate spot check, I can confidently counter that at least one widely available brand (in Australia at least) is still \xe2\x80\x98rocking\xe2\x80\x99 the square. Old school, traditionalist or simply behind the times? Better men than me will have to decide\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Simon Williams.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cReading the Fiver on my iPad ensconced in the usual place, as is appropriate, I was able to grab hold of a piece of toilet roll that was at hand and immediately test Gerry Wall\xe2\x80\x99s proposition. Not so. It turns out that down here in Sydney, Sorbent is delivered in perfect squares. I am not sure what international cultural implications this has, but thanks for making the usual task of reading the Fiver while on the job so much more interesting &amp; interactive\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Tim Birdsall.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
