b'Wolfsburg v Everton: Europa League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>Everton finish top of their group with a game to spare thanks to an away performance that was pleasingly close to a cliche: resolute defending and swift, sharp counter-attacking. Martinez can take particular satisfaction from the performances of his defence, in which Luke Garbutt looked at ease, and also of Lukaku. The only downer on the night was an injury to McCarthy. It remains to be seen how serious that is. </p>'
