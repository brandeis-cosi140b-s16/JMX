b'Chelsea v Arsenal: match preview'


b'<p>The focus will be drawn to Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas as he confronts his former club for the first time since returning to the Premier League, but the onus is on Arsenal to make a positive impression at Stamford Bridge. This team were thrashed 6-0 in the corresponding fixture back in March in the manager\xe2\x80\x99s 1,000th game in charge, and Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger has yet to defeat a Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho side in 11 previous meetings. This is a contest between the division\xe2\x80\x99s two remaining unbeaten teams: it would be a timely occasion for Wenger to break that duck.
