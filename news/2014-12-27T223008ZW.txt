b'Who to buy in the transfer window? Premier League fans set out their wishlists'


b'ARSENAL <p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger assured us at the AGM that he\xe2\x80\x99d be making an effort to bolster our gossamer-thin defensive ranks \xe2\x80\x93 and Mats Hummels or Ron Vlaar would do the job nicely. But with Manchester United equally desperate, competition for centre-halves will be fierce. So, loth as I am to lose Carl Jenkinson, circumstances suggest that, with Winston Reid dawdling over a new contract, a swap deal may be feasible. A muscular Matic\xe2\x80\x91type midfield stopper is also a must. Bernard Azulay GoonersDiary.co.uk</p> ASTON VILLA <p>We need midfielders \xe2\x80\x93 players with the confidence to beat a man or play a difficult, goalwards ball, with the quality of Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s Gylfi Sigurdsson or Everton\xe2\x80\x99s Ross Barkley. And, sadly, we may as well sell Charles N\xe2\x80\x99Zogbia \xe2\x80\x93 a gifted player but a constant disappointment. Jonathan Pritchard </p> BURNLEY <p>Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi could slot in. If not them, I\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to focus on a strong central midfield player and, most importantly, a central defender simply because Michael Duff isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to go on forever. Tony Scholes @Clarets_Mad</p> CHELSEA <p>I\xe2\x80\x99d say our squad is generally well balanced, although if John Terry is injured we could struggle. That said, a couple of the kids have looked capable of stepping up \xe2\x80\x93 Kurt Zouma and Andreas Christensen. A little raw maybe, but that\xe2\x80\x99s only to be expected. Trizia Fiorellino Chelsea Supporters\xe2\x80\x99 Group</p> CRYSTAL PALACE <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s frustrating: our priorities are the exact same positions we tried and failed to fill in the summer. Whoever the next manager is, we have to sign a left-back, having missing out on Tyrone Mings in August. Everyone wants a striker with power, pace and goals, and Palace are no different: Joel Campbell , Troy Deeney, Yaya Sanogo? Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s Baf\xc3\xa9timbi Gomis is in the frame and the long shadow of Peter Crouch  also looms large. But without a manager and with a potential takeover going on, you wonder if we will get any business done at all. Chris Waters @Clapham_Grand</p> EVERTON <p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve dropped too many points at home and really need another clinical striker. Wilfried Bony would do nicely. Another goalkeeper as backup to Tim Howard would be good, too: Joel Robles has failed to convince. Steve Jones BlueKipper.com</p> HULL <p>Despite an abundance of midfielders we look light on quality in that area. Someone with energy who tackles would be handy. Fabian Delph is out of our league but he\xe2\x80\x99s the sort we need. A loan striker would give us options too. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pity James Wilson is getting games at Man United \xe2\x80\x93 he\xe2\x80\x99d be ideal. Rick Skelton @HullCityLive</p> LEICESTER <p>The usual whirlwind of speculation has hit like a hurricane. An audacious bid for the Croat Andrej Kramaric at least shows ambition but given his links to Chelsea and Juventus I won\xe2\x80\x99t hold my breath. A new left-back, winger and striker are necessities not priorities: names like Scott Sinclair and Jermain Defoe have been mentioned but Nigel Pearson loves an obscure find, so we have as much chance of signing a winger from the Azerbaijani top flight as Joel Campbell coming in on loan. Chris Whiting @ChrisRWhiting</p> LIVERPOOL <p>The obvious needs are a keeper and a striker. Petr Cech would be great, but Chelsea won\xe2\x80\x99t let him go, so perhaps we should could go back to Southampton for Fraser Forster. Up front, Wilfried Bony for sure, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of talk about Gonzalo Higua\xc3\xadn. We need a central midfielder too. Kevin De Bruyne looks good but perhaps we could tempt James Milner from down the road. Priorities are getting some confidence \xe2\x80\x93 and a little guile wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go amiss, too. Steph Jones</p> MANCHESTER CITY <p>The summer spending addressed all the old weaknesses but, with all of our senior strikers currently injured, we may be forced into the market. The only player I can think of that ticks every box is Jay Rodriguez, although Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s Mario Mandzukic has also been linked. Otherwise, a healthy extension on Lampard\xe2\x80\x99s loan would satisfy me. Lloyd Scragg @Lloyd_Scragg</p> MANCHESTER UNITED <p>Not a revelation, this, but United\xe2\x80\x99s defence needs work. Mats Hummels is my first choice, Diego God\xc3\xadn my second and Ron Vlaar third. We need a leader and a steadying influence at the back, someone the younger defenders can look up to and follow, and someone who can organise and marshall his team-mates. Shaun O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell</p> NEWCASTLE <p>We need another striker. Andr\xc3\xa9-Pierre Gignac will be tough to bring in but could be worth the effort. Also, a commanding centre-half would be very welcome \xe2\x80\x93 no doubt chief scout Graham Carr will have a long list of options from the Netherlands and France. Richard and David Holmes</p> QPR <p>A striker is the most obvious need. Do we look for a target man with Premier League experience or a young poacher hungry to make his name? Personally I\xe2\x80\x99d go for the latter \xe2\x80\x93 Eoin Doyle from Chesterfield or Dele Alli from MK Dons could fit the bill nicely. Adam Boxer QPR.VitalFootball.co.uk</p> SOUTHAMPTON <p>Recent form has shown that when players like Dusan Tadic and Graziano Pell\xc3\xa8 go off the boil we don\xe2\x80\x99t have quality replacements to give them time out to recharge. More attacking options will be key to securing a European place, though the return of Jay Rodriguez from injury will be like a new signing, too. Ben Gammon @GoMarchingIn</p> STOKE <p>Victor Moses would be at the top of my list. His injury left a massive hole \xe2\x80\x93 at times he has been unplayable. Aaron Lennon  has also been rumoured \xe2\x80\x93 I think he\xe2\x80\x99d fit in well. I\xe2\x80\x99d also love a commanding centre-half. I\xe2\x80\x99m not convinced by Marc Wilson and Mark Hughes doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem convinced by Robert Huth. Rob Holloway</p> SUNDERLAND <p>We clearly need another striker to complement Steven Fletcher and Connor Wickham. Jozy Altidore will be away to foreign climes and it is difficult to bring in players from overseas in January \xe2\x80\x93 we found that out with Nacho Scocco. Domestically, someone like Danny Ings or Troy Deeney might fit, or maybe Kris Commons from Celtic. We\xe2\x80\x99re also running short of defenders \xe2\x80\x93 Sam Byram from Leeds has been spoken of. But we have to be careful. New players are not always a panacea. Pete Sixsmith SalutSunderland.com</p> SWANSEA <p>Wilfried Bony could be absent for more than a month at the Africa Cup of Nations and, with only Baf\xc3\xa9timbi Gomis as our backup, another attacker will be a priority. We\xe2\x80\x99ve brought in Nelson Oliveira on loan, but he\xe2\x80\x99s hardly the sort of name we need as cover for a striker like Bony as he lacks experience \xe2\x80\x93 not to mention goals at any decent level. Gomis is strongly being linked with a move to Palace but we really need to keep hold of him. Some say we\xe2\x80\x99re also signing Exeter midfielder Matt Grimes. I\xe2\x80\x99d like a full-back, too. Kevin Elphick Swansea.VitalFootball.co.uk</p> TOTTENHAM <p>I\xe2\x80\x99d start with a centre-forward who can lead the line and bring the best out of other players. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t had that since Dimitar Berbatov. We also need a leader \xe2\x80\x93 the choice of Youn\xc3\xa8s Kaboul as captain is bizarre.\xc2\xa0 Now that we have Paul Mitchell in charge of recruitment and analysis we might begin to identify such players, and work out who to let go. He may well be the most influential person to have left Southampton during the recent exodus \xe2\x80\x93 if we let him work his side of the street without interference. Dave Mason</p> WEST BROM <p>We\xe2\x80\x99re unlikely to sign anybody unless we unload players as the squad is over quota. But we still lack pace. Although he is ex-Wolves, West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s Matt Jarvis could do a job. Richard Jefferson @RichBaggie</p> WEST HAM <p>The Africa Cup of Nations will weaken the squad, but it\xe2\x80\x99s strong enough. We could do with ensuring Winston Reid signs a new contract, finding a fourth centre-back and maybe adding another striker to replace Carlton Cole. Pete May HammersInTheHeart.blogspot.co.uk</p>'
