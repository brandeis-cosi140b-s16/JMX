b'<p>The Chelsea captain, John Terry, has sent his condolences to Rio Ferdinand following the death of his former England team-mate\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Rebecca Ellison, on Friday night.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOn behalf of everyone at Chelsea, we send our condolences to Rio Ferdinand and his family,\xe2\x80\x9d Terry said minutes after Chelsea confirmed this season\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League title as theirs, thanks to a 1-0 win at home to Crystal Palace.</p> <p>Ellison, 34, passed away on Friday night following a short battle with cancer. \xe2\x80\x9cMy soul mate slipped away last night,\xe2\x80\x9d Ferdinand said in a statement released by his current club, QPR. She leaves behind three children, Lorenz, nine, Tate, six, and four-year-old Tia.</p> <p>Ferdinand and Terry formed a formidable partnership at the heart of the England defence in the middle of the last decade but they no longer speak as a result of a fall-out following Terry\xe2\x80\x99s racism case with Ferdinand\xe2\x80\x99s brother, Anton. However, last week Rio Ferdinand described Terry\xe2\x80\x99s performances this season as \xe2\x80\x9coutstanding\xe2\x80\x9d.</p>'
