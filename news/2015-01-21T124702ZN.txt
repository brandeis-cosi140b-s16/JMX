b'<p>A four-year-old Norwegian girl named YNWA by her Liverpool-supporting parents is preparing to make an emotional first visit to Anfield.</p> <p>YNWA \xe2\x80\x93 named after the abbreviation to Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s You\xe2\x80\x99ll Never Walk Alone anthem \xe2\x80\x93 has been promised the trip as a present when she turns five in May.</p> <p>YNWA\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Eirin Isabel Iversen, told the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet that when names were discussed early on in her pregnancy they quickly agreed that Gerrard was the obvious name for a boy \xe2\x80\x93 but the options for girls took more debate. \xe2\x80\x9cBut when I suggested YNWA, he entirely agreed.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Iversen said that at kindergarten the girl\xe2\x80\x99s clothes are labeled with the name YNWA, but she has been given the opportunity to change it if she sees fit.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHer full name is Karoline YNWA \xe2\x80\x93 we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really force her to cheer on Liverpool. But she is very proud of her name.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHer father has promised her a trip to see Liverpool when she is five, so now she is looking forward to that very much. She already likes to sit with her father wearing a Liverpool shirt to watch matches.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Christian Moller, chair of Norway\xe2\x80\x99s Liverpool fans\xe2\x80\x99 group, said this was one of several examples of Norwegian parents naming children in tribute to the club.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not the first time. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bit unusual, perhaps, but it\xe2\x80\x99s quite neutral. Among others parents to have chosen Liverpool names there was one couple who called their daughter Tia after \xe2\x80\x98This is Anfield\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
