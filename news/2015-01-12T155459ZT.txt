b'The Fiver | An inverse Frank Drebin'


b'<p>\xe2\x80\x98AND DON\xe2\x80\x99T CALL ME SHIRLEY\xe2\x80\x99</p> <p>There\xe2\x80\x99s a scene in N@ked Gun: a murderous doctor has just had his comeuppance on a runaway missile (via a collision with an oil tanker) and Lieutenant Frank Drebin stands in front of an exploding fireworks factory into which said missile and MD have just crashed. Workers run for cover. Explosions rip the roof off. Rockets whizz through the air. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right. Move on! Nothing to see here. Please disperse! There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to see here \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>There was something of that ilk about Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s weekend insistence that There Is Definitely Not A Crisis Of Any Kind At Barcelona And It\xe2\x80\x99s All Absolutely Fine And Lovely. After helping his side to a morale-boosting 3-1 win over Atl\xc3\xa9tico, Lil\xe2\x80\x99 Leo Messi adjusted his halo and adopted his most angelic expression. \xe2\x80\x9cI have never demanded anything to stay because I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any intention of going,\xe2\x80\x9d he trilled. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard people say that my dad had spoken to Chelsea, to City \xe2\x80\xa6 it\xe2\x80\x99s all lies. I heard all sorts of things said. I never come out and deny [stories] but this time I am. It has been said that I have pushed out lots of people \xe2\x80\xa6 Eto\xe2\x80\x99o, Ibrahimovic, Bojan, Guardiola \xe2\x80\xa6 [and] I didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask them to sack our manager.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not good for people to look for rivalry between me and Luis Enrique because there isn\xe2\x80\x99t any. It hurts because it comes from people who [supposedly] love Barcelona. It\xe2\x80\x99s people who want to hurt the club.\xe2\x80\x9d Javier Mascherano was on the same page. \xe2\x80\x9cIn any group of 40 or 50 people, things happen but that does not mean we\xe2\x80\x99re not united,\xe2\x80\x9d shrugged the midfielder. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no problem with Messi and Luis Enrique. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about [institutional issues] but when they stick us in the middle, you have to. It\xe2\x80\x99s not nice for them to try to stain you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Still, at least everyone can cheer themselves up with a nice trip to the Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 oh. 50-1 outsider you say? Mind you, even the 1-10 favourite Him had a miserable weekend, getting very cross when Gareth Bale failed to pass to him for a tap-in even though Real Madrid were 3-0 up. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir relationship is fantastic,\xe2\x80\x9d cheered Real defender Nacho, as catherine wheels whirled in the background. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re a group, we all get on amazingly.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Even the third and final Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or contender had a rough time of it. Manuel Neuer had to take time out from his Big Book Of Very Hard Crossword Puzzles that he keeps handy to occupy him during Bayern matches to actually bend over and pick the ball out of the net. He conceded a goal. An actual real goal. Bayern still won, of course, coming from behind to beat Mainz 2-1 but it means all three contenders arrive in Zurich on a bit of a downer. Mind you, so does everyone. Every year with the Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or Fifa pull an inverse Drebin \xe2\x80\x93 insisting there really is something to see here while standing in front of an empty space.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Barry Glendenning from around 4.30pm GMT, aka NOW!, for coverage of Him winning the Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>9 January: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s social media! It comes from Israel, or something. I heard that somebody else already took over! There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of rumours, what can I say? The only thing we need is to be positive. I know what our targets were before the season \xe2\x80\x93 we had agreements with the chairman \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s not that because you don\xe2\x80\x99t pick up points now everything is bad. I think the long-term is more important, but when they put things on social media, you can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything about it, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to waste energy on it\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Charlton boss Bob Peeters laughs off reports of his impending demise at The Valley.</p> <p>11 January: Sacked. Pesky old social media. \xe2\x80\x9cThe board felt they had to make a change at this time,\xe2\x80\x9d simpered a club statement.</p>      FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLouis van Gaal is starting to remind me of Lloyd Braun, George Costanza\xe2\x80\x99s successful neighbour in Seinfeld to whom he is constantly compared. In episode 159, the highly recommended Braun is drafted in by George\xe2\x80\x99s dad to turn around the family computer sales business. After a promising start Braun is roundly praised as a natural salesman, however in the end it turned out that Braun was just a crazy charlatan whose early sales were a sham and it ended up bringing Costanza &amp; Sons to the brink of bankruptcy. In this analogy David Moyes is George Costanza, the maligned heir who took all the flack despite his sales figures being just as bad as Braun\xe2\x80\x99s. Serenity now!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Dan O\xe2\x80\x99Brien.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRegarding trying to add to the atmosphere as a fan (Fiver letters passim). My local team Brisbane Roar won the Flamin\xe2\x80\x99 A-League for the third time in four years. I went to the parade, where they were handing out rolled-up ribbons to throw as they unfurled. At the presentation I went to throw one of these and failed to hold on to the tail for it to unfurl and instead nailed a tall guy towards the front in the head. Cue me looking behind me as I wandered to a different part of the crowd to hide in shame\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Phil Mercer.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI liked Conor O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke\xe2\x80\x99s accurate description of Per Mertesacker as a Malay chicken (Friday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters). Expanding on that theme, might I suggest the chihuahua as Mathieu Flamini\xe2\x80\x99s comparative animal. Both are quick, energetic and small enough to be carried around in a bag. Moreover, both are hilariously aggressive for someone of their size and build\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Rigel Barros.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf we\xe2\x80\x99re comparing Per Mertesacker to animals now, then surely the best comparison is the Greenland shark, an animal that is so slow it needs all of its food to be asleep in order to eat it. It has a top speed of 1mph, so its prey merely needs to be conscious to outrun it\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Daniel Doody.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

China went on to win 1-0, while Palestine were thumped 4-0 by Japan in their tournament debut.</p> <p>The good ship Do One has docked as close to Manchester as it could to have City\xe2\x80\x99s Matija Nastasic ushered aboard it for a loan to Schalke for the rest of the season.</p> <p>Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri has dented Liverpool fans\xe2\x80\x99 hopes that he is interested in signing Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Mario Balotelli. \xe2\x80\x9cI think this is a made-up story,\xe2\x80\x9d he parped. Meanwhile, Balotelli\xe2\x80\x99s Mr 15% Mino Raiola has defended the striker\xe2\x80\x99s form. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to go abroad and adapt quickly to a new team,\xe2\x80\x9d he smokescreened of the player who previously spent nearly three seasons in England.</p> <p>And good news for The Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s Pope\xe2\x80\x99s Newc O\xe2\x80\x99Rangers naming committee: Phoenix Suns owner Robert Sarver has pulled out of a bid to take over the club after his \xc2\xa320m offer was blocked.</p> RECOMMENDED LISTENING <p>DOWNLOAD FOOTBALL WEEKLY!
