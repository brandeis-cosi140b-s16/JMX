b'REALITY BITES FOR LUIS, THEN LUIS BITES BACK  <p>Strong? Yup. Fast? You betcha. Fresh from the fight? Well, he looked clean and his hair was heavily gelled, so it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that when Lu\xc3\xads Figo launched his campaign to succeed Sepp Blatter as Fifa president back in February, The Fiver noted that here was the streetwise Hercules that world football had been holding out for til the end of the night.</p> <p>BAM! He planned to spend half of Fifa\xe2\x80\x99s $2.5bn four-year revenue on grassroots football. KERPOW! He hoped to redistribute two-thirds of its $1.5bn cash reserves to the 209 nation states. BIFF! He was going to increase the use of technology in the game! THUNK! He had no plans to make women play football while kitted out in Wonder Woman type bustiers and hot pants. So how\xe2\x80\x99s it all going for Luis? Er, not great, because yesterday evening the former world footballer of the year picked up his ball and ran home, pulling out of the race along with the Dutch FA president Michael van Praag and embarking on a quite splendid rant about Sepp.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis process is a plebiscite for the delivery of absolute power to one man \xe2\x80\x93 something I refuse to go along with,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is why, after a personal reflection and sharing views with two other candidates in this process, I believe that what is going to happen on 29 May in Zurich is not a normal electoral act.\xe2\x80\x9d Now while The Fiver admires Figo\xe2\x80\x99s candour, we can\xe2\x80\x99t help but be a little disappointed by his naivety, because there are deep sea-dwelling goblin sharks swimming around the floor of the Western Indo-Pacific region who know the Fifa presidential election process is \xe2\x80\x9ca plebiscite for the delivery of absolute power to one man\xe2\x80\x9d and if Luis was expecting an even remotely fair crack at getting to park his backside on the Iron Throne in the Great Hall of Fifa\xe2\x80\x99s Red Keep, then he is very deluded indeed.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen with my own eyes federation presidents who, after one day comparing Fifa leaders to the devil, then go on stage and compare those same people with Jesus Christ,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luis, harrumphing about a recent Concacaf congress in which Blatter was likened to Jesus, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody told me about this. I saw it with my own eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of course what has been seen cannot be unseen and going on to complain about the absence of any form of debate and the fact that no other candidates for next week\xe2\x80\x99s election have been given a platform to address Fifa delegates, Luis likened Fifa to a dictatorship and thundered that he would not give his consent \xe2\x80\x9cto a process which will end on 29 May and from which soccer will not emerge the winner\xe2\x80\x9d. It certainly will not but Sepp will and for that all his Fifa cronies, yes-men and lickspittles will be exceedingly grateful. </p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe had lots of mistakes against us but that\xe2\x80\x99s football. Maybe \xe2\x80\x98campaign\xe2\x80\x99 is not a nice word. Maybe I would take that word out from my explanation and my comments. We had very bad decisions over a big period of time but I also made bad decisions, no problem\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho takes leave of his senses and admits for once that he may have been wrong when claiming there was a \xe2\x80\x9ccampaign\xe2\x80\x9d against Chelsea this season.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLet me be one of the 1,057 pedants young enough to remember middle school band class to point out to Peter Oh (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver Letters) that one actually plays the saxophone with cold air breathing as if trying to cool a bowl of soup. The sweet, musical hot air that Van Gaal emits would be better suited to a brass instrument such as the trumpet\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Luke R.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAh yes - that\xe2\x80\x99ll be the Candy Dulfer who in 1993 covered the Average White Band\xe2\x80\x99s signature tune Pick up the Pieces. Seems entirely appropriate for the man who followed David Moyes\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Steve Allen.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIs \xe2\x80\x98Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver\xe2\x80\x99 (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver) having personal problems? Last time he got a call up he was $exually repressed, now he is repressed in general\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Matt Corbishley.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFollowing on from Calvin Jones\xe2\x80\x99 original suggestion for insignia above badges (and, hopefully, concluding what is rapidly turning into a dull series ...) would West Ham be able to show off: not just three FA Cup stars and one Cup Winners Cup star, but the 1966 Jules Rimet trophy, because everyone knows that it was West Ham who won the World C ... yaaawn ... No, I thought not...\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Allister Manson.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

We want to resolve the situation but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change my approach to him. There is no problem there,\xe2\x80\x9d the manager said, while trying to keep a straight face.</p> <p>Raheem Sterling update No724 of the week: Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger has hinted Arsenal wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be put off signing Sterling by the behaviour of the player\xe2\x80\x99s Mr 10%. \xe2\x80\x9cMost of the time it\xe2\x80\x99s not the player who causes the problems. They come as a package, that\xe2\x80\x99s true but the problems do not always come from the player. Sometimes they come from the package,\xe2\x80\x9d he mused.</p> <p>Raheem Sterling update No725 of the week: Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Manuel Pellegrini has described him as \xe2\x80\x9ca very important player\xe2\x80\x9d, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what happens with Sterling. We finish the season. After that we will see what we need and which players can come here.\xe2\x80\x9d </p> <p>Eden Hazard\xe2\x80\x99s record of appearing in all of Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s league games this term may come to an end in their final match, against Sunderland on Sunday, due to wisdom tooth-ouch. \xe2\x80\x9cHis mouth is in trouble. He had surgery, three teeth. But now there\xe2\x80\x99s an infection,\xe2\x80\x9d winced Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho, who was today named Premier League manager of the season.</p> <p>And this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s play-offs at Wembley will go ahead as planned despite the discovery of an unexploded 110lb second world war bomb near the stadium. \xe2\x80\x9cThis bomb is a live munition in a potentially dangerous condition,\xe2\x80\x9d said an army spokesman, making Southend, Wycombe, Preston, Swindon, Norwich and Middlesbrough fans even more nervous about their respective matches than they already were.</p> STILL WANT MORE? <p>1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10 things to look out for this weekend, courtesy of Simon Burnton and Scott Murray.</p> <p>Scott\xe2\x80\x99s forensic analysis of the day $tevie Mbe rolled up his sleeves, puffed out his cheeks and dragged Liverpool to the 2005 Champions League includes an argument for making Milan Baros man of the match.

And it has nothing to do with Mr Roy\xe2\x80\x99s squad announcement yesterday.</p> <p>Can the last local lad out of Anfield please turn off the light? No need, writes Sachin Nakrani, Jon Flanagan is the new standard bearer of Scouse.</p> <p>Remember the first play-offs, way back when in 1987?
