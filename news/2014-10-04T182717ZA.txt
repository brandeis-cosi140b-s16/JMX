b'Aston Villa v Manchester City: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>Villa defended well and, in the first half at least, pressed well and could have scored one or two themselves, but one of the benefits of having players like Toure and Aguero is they\xe2\x80\x99re always likely to produce a moment such as the ones they did. City second in the table, two back from Chelsea who play Arsenal tomorrow.</p> <p>Cheers for reading, and chipping in, for those that did. Night.</p>'
