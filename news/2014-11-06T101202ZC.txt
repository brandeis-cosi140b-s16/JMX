b"Champions League review: Dortmund's riddle and Luiz Adriano's record trick"


b'The Force is not strong in Wenger <p>Deep down, a part of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger must have been pleased. Something within a coach who was once celebrated for nurturing youth and trying to slay financial monsters must have lit up with righteous glee as a bold and talented young Anderlecht side refused to accept defeat against the ultimate Champions League establishment club, Arsenal, who just hang around the tournament year after year, rarely doing anything inspiring, just getting rich. And perhaps that explains it: perhaps there is an Anakin Skywalker/Darth Vader-style conflict raging within Wenger, and some residual high-mindedness prevents him from properly doing what Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho tends to do: identifying the gaps in his team and just spending whatever it takes to fill them with the best available players. Or maybe, like all those fouls that his players used to commit, Wenger just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see blatant weaknesses and, even worse, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see them. Paul Doyle</p> Dortmund\xe2\x80\x99s European opponents play to their strengths     9-5 on corners, which shows Dortmund were better... Photograph: Patrik Stollarz/AFP/Getty Images    <p>Borussia Dortmund have more points after four Champions League matches than they do after 10 Bundesliga games, and have scored 13 goals in what is supposed to Europe\xe2\x80\x99s elite competition, compared to just 11 domestically. What\xe2\x80\x99s up? It seems that J\xc3\xbcrgen Klopp\xe2\x80\x99s injury-ravaged side have been cast into a handy Champions League group, featuring teams who are neither equipped nor inclined to stifle opponents and thus leave lots of space in which Dortmund can romp free and swiftly. PD</p> Another rising Belgian star     Yannick Ferreira Carrasco , another off the remarkable Belgian production line, runs towards the ball. Photograph: Miguel Riopa/AFP/Getty Images    <p>Attend nearly any match in the world and there are certain things you are sure to see, such as (a) some gonk filming the action with a mobile phone so that it can be viewed later on a tiny screen rather than when it is actually happening right in front of him in real life, thereby proving what rash schoolboy spurters have always known, that experiencing something fully is not as important as being able to boast about experiencing it slightly; and (b) a gifted young Belgian footballer. One notable feature of Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s Benfica-Monaco match was another fine performance by Yannick Ferreira Carrasco, the 21-year-old Belgian attacking midfielder who has been in sparkling form in Ligue 1 and caused much more trouble to Benfica than the disappointing Joao Moutinho or Lucas Ocampos did. PD</p> Are Liverpool starting to pull themselves together?     Real Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s Karim Benzema scores against Liverpool. Photograph: Reuters    <p>At times this season it has seemed that Liverpool have not only failed to get over the loss of Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez but actually lurched into a full-blown breakdown, stumbling through the season like a club on the bitter rebound, hellbent on doing things as differently as possible to the way they did them when they were with their Uruguayan darling. That would not only explain the purchase of Mario Balotelli \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps the least Su\xc3\xa1rez-like striker on the planet \xe2\x80\x93 but also the new-found slowness, almost passivity, with which they have played and the recent attempt to remove Steven Gerrard from the quarterback role in which he revelled last term. It\xe2\x80\x99s all been a bit of a puzzle. And it certainly hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been working. </p> <p>Thankfully, it seems that Brendan Rodgers noticed that the time had come for a good shake-up in the hope that that might clear everyone\xe2\x80\x99s minds, including his. Tuesday night\xe2\x80\x99s surprising team selection might have woken a few people up and reminded Liverpool what they are supposed to be about, as the men in Red pressed with something approaching the dynamism of last season and had a semblance of cohesion and fortitude to them. But not, of course, enough to justify Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 bizarrely triumphant post-match demeanour: they did, after all, lose. And it is far from certain that they will beat Basel and Ludogorets in their remaining Champions League games, let alone Chelsea this weekend. But at least a cycle of torpor was broken and some players \xe2\x80\x93 in particular Emre Can \xe2\x80\x93 suggested that they are ready to be deployed more regularly from the start. Gerrard, then, could soon be set for a more enduring rest. If Rodgers really is ready to adjust to difficult truths.

So the story goes, giddy Harp full back Tom O\xe2\x80\x99Kane rushed off to send a telegram to his former colleagues just down the road at Arbroath, boasting of the gargantuan success, but his grin must have faltered somewhat when he discovered that the very same day, Arbroath had beaten Bon Accord 36-0. What were the chances? Shakhtar Donetsk striker Luiz Adriano\xe2\x80\x99s feat isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite on the same level as a 35-goal hoying, but the Brazilian became the first man to ever score back-to-back hat-tricks in the Champions League on Wednesday night, a mighty impressive feat for sure, only to be upstaged a little by Lionel Messi rather peskily equalling Ra\xc3\xbal\xe2\x80\x99s goals record that very same evening. </p>     Luiz Adriano Photograph: Reutrs    <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s been a decent few weeks for Luiz Adriano, all in all. Indeed, BATE Borisov might have thought themselves quite lucky to only get away with a treble from the Brazilian and a 5-0 defeat by Shakhtar, given that in the last round of games Adriano bagged five in their 7-0 demolition of the Belarusian side, presumably leaving BATE keeper Andriy Pyatov, the man between the sticks for all 12 harrowing goals, a quivering and shell-shocked mess, and if he never sees another orange and black-striped shirt it will be too soon. And to cap things rather nicely for Adriano, he earned his first call-up to the Brazil squad for the upcoming friendlies against Turkey and Austria. Very nice indeed. Nick Miller</p> <p>Losers \xe2\x80\xa6 Manuel Pellegrini: It\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable that, having not won any of their first four matches, Manchester City still have a reasonable chance of qualifying for the knockout stages of the Champions League. In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s not quite so much remarkable as absurd. Still, to do so they will need to beat both Roma and Bayern Munich, the latter without Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 and Fernandinho following their red cards against CSKA Moscow, and quite possibly David Silva if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t recover from his knee injury in time. So, a tall order, then. City will theoretically be bouyed by Bayern having already qualified as group winners, and their own injury issues (David Alaba was the latest to go lame on Wednesday) probably meaning that Pep Guardiola will field a \xe2\x80\x98weakened\xe2\x80\x99 side when they visit the Etihad, but would you trust this City side to beat even a second-string Bayern side in the Champions League?</p> <p>City\xe2\x80\x99s European blindspot is troubling for the club but more immediately their manager, who was brought in with improvement on the continent in mind following Roberto Mancini\xe2\x80\x99s struggles, although given the state City are currently in, finishing third in a group behind Bayern and Napoli a couple of years ago suddenly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look quite so bad. A couple of things will trouble City further, notably Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s apparent bafflement at their inability to compete in the competition (\xe2\x80\x9cThe mentality of the players, all of them are important players, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand why they cannot play in Champions League\xe2\x80\x9d), but also how the team fell apart in the face of a one-goal deficit against an average CSKA side. They were on the end of some rough refereeing decisions in the closing stages, but they had two men sent off for acts of brainlessness to rival Chris Smalling, and were lucky not to see Samir Nasri dismissed as well. City don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be progressing in Europe, and that could do for Pellegrini eventually. Incidentally, at the end of last month the Chilean was 66-1 to be the next Premier League manager to leave his job. If you\xe2\x80\x99re quick, you can just get 8-1 now.

Photograph: Dougie Allward/JMP/REX    <p>Planning is everything, we are told. Fail to prepare, etc and so on. Dave Brailsford will have a lucrative career on the motivational speaking circuit when his cycling days are over, preaching the benefits of marginal gains. All of which might be true, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a little joyless, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? The fun bits of sport are the chaotic, the unpredictable and the logic-defying. It\xe2\x80\x99s why we support the underdog and watch clips of star players missing open goals over and over. It was therefore pretty amusing and, dare we say refreshing, to see Anderlecht yank Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s chain on Tuesday despite their coach being stuck in traffic on the way to the ground, the driver rather optimistically thinking he could breeze through London rush-hour traffic without too much bother. The Anderlecht players stumbled off the bus 45 minutes before kick-off at the Emirates, quite possibly pulling on their socks as they went, and went through what were presumably quite cursory warm-ups before taking the field. Granted, they took a little while to get going, but despite this chaos and terrible preparation, they managed to come from 3-0 down and claim an implausible draw. Comforting proof that no matter how well you plan, and how meticulously you prepare, sometimes logic will flit out of the window. More of this sort of thing, please. NM</p>'
