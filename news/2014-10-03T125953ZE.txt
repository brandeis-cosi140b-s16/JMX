b'Emma Hayes: Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s other Special One on brink of league title glory'


b'<p>Six years ago Emma Hayes stood at a major crossroads in her life. Having just helped Arsenal Ladies to complete an historic quadruple in winning the Uefa Cup as assistant coach to the legendary Vic Akers, she was faced with job offers from three different football clubs. Hayes had no idea which one to go for.</p> <p>One of her mentors recommended that she see a clairvoyant. The 37-year-old laughs at the memory of it now, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99d just had three unbelievable offers, three very confusing offers \xe2\x80\x93 to take over from Vic at Arsenal, or go to America and coach Chicago Red Stars or St Louis. I walked into the room, sat down and this woman turned the cards over. She said: \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s none of them. You\xe2\x80\x99re going to have an absolutely massive future with Chelsea.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Hayes chose Arsenal. Then, in a panic, ran home through the rain and phoned Chicago. She had changed her mind.</p> <p>It would be another four years before Chelsea came knocking. The current Chelsea Ladies manager cackles. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you imagine my face when [in 2012] I then got that phone call from Chelsea? It was so bizarre. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never accepted a job as quickly as I accepted the Chelsea one. I said yes, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even ask about the money. I just thought: this is my calling.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Now the club stand on the brink of winning their very first league title, earning the London-born coach comparisons with her men\xe2\x80\x99s team counterpart, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho. Should Chelsea win against the already relegated Everton on Sunday, and defending champions Liverpool lose, as well as Birmingham, Hayes\xe2\x80\x99s team will secure the title in front of a home crowd, with a game in hand.</p> <p>Considering that Chelsea finished second from bottom last season, and endured a soul-destroying run of 10 defeats in 12 league games, Hayes\xe2\x80\x99s achievement is near miraculous. Never mind the fact that she is the only female manager in the top tier of the FA Women\xe2\x80\x99s Super League. (Soon she will be one of just two female managers out of 18 clubs in the top two leagues, following the announcement that Jayne Ludlow will leave Reading next month to take on the Wales job.)</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I see all the boys in the top jobs across our leagues, I\xe2\x80\x99m like: \xe2\x80\x98Oh my God, the only woman sitting on top of the pile and I\xe2\x80\x99m only there twice a week!\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant!\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Did she ever question what she was doing last season? \xe2\x80\x9cNo, not at all,\xe2\x80\x9d says Hayes, adamant. \xe2\x80\x9cI always said to my staff I can handle it. You have to trust me. I\xe2\x80\x99m willing to take the flak for it, just stand beside me.\xe2\x80\x9d What about her players? \xe2\x80\x9cEni [Aluko] hated losing, but that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the reasons I wanted her to stay \xe2\x80\x93 because she\xe2\x80\x99s a winner.\xe2\x80\x9d How about her employers? \xe2\x80\x9cThe club supported me. I was very clear from the outset, we might go backwards before we go forwards. We needed to gut this out. My boss, Emma Wilkinson, was very supportive of that. She was very patient. To be honest I enjoyed it. I enjoyed having the resolve to work through that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Hayes says getting fired from Chicago in 2010 \xe2\x80\x9chardened\xe2\x80\x9d her as a coach. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll never forget, Jill Ellis, the US national team coach, texted me and said: \xe2\x80\x98Welcome to the coaching fraternity, you haven\xe2\x80\x99t coached unless you\xe2\x80\x99ve been fired.\xe2\x80\x99 It was the most powerful thing anyone could have told me. Of course it hurt like hell, but it was an important learning curve.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In a coaching career that began in her late teens \xe2\x80\x93 after an injury cut short her playing career at Arsenal \xe2\x80\x93 Hayes has been back and forth across the Atlantic developing her skills. Coaching qualifications (\xe2\x80\x9cI paid for every single one \xe2\x80\xa6 I was always the only female\xe2\x80\x9d) jostled for position alongside a degree in European studies and a Masters in international affairs. Learning the ropes at Major League Soccer camps at the age of 23 after setting out with \xe2\x80\x9ca backpack and $1,000\xe2\x80\x9d, Hayes says she has coached almost every age bracket, across both genders.</p> <p>Along the way she also collected an impressive list of mentors \xe2\x80\x93 from Akers to Raymond Verheijen, the renowned coach and conditioning specialist who taught Frank Rijkaard his trade, and most recently helped Argentina reach the World Cup final. The Dutchman\xe2\x80\x99s interest in periodisation is a particular passion for Hayes, who has embedded his theories into her Chelsea set-up.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe guy\xe2\x80\x99s a genius,\xe2\x80\x9d says Hayes, enthusiastically, revealing that Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s own system contains many parallels. \xe2\x80\x9cMore similarities than differences,\xe2\x80\x9d she nods. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s four factors: age, level they\xe2\x80\x99ve just come from playing at, injury history and position they play in. So Eni, for example, she\xe2\x80\x99s our Ferrari, she requires more petrol \xe2\x80\x93 or rest \xe2\x80\x93 than the others. Then there\xe2\x80\x99s Claire Rafferty who\xe2\x80\x99s had three ACL injuries \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>That bedding in work over last year laid the groundwork for a reworked team, to which she added new recruits, young and old, to make the difference this season. From foreign buys \xe2\x80\x93 including the South Korean midfielder, and Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s top scorer, Ji So-yun \xe2\x80\x93 to an English spine of experience in Katie Chapman and Laura Bassett.</p> <p>Some will assume that Chelsea have splashed the cash, but Hayes is resolute. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have only the fifth largest budget in the league \xe2\x80\x93 four teams around us have more than double our budget. And on full time managers, and full time staff \xe2\x80\xa6 We don\xe2\x80\x99t just throw money at things. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got players playing on really little money who have bought into what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>She means restructuring the club, from integrating the academy, reserves and first team to overseeing the construction of a dedicated Ladies floodlit pitch and clubhouse.</p> <p>Along the way the journey has been hard. Hayes works three jobs \xe2\x80\x93 running a family business in foreign exchange alongside appearances as an analyst for Eurosport, and the Chelsea role. She is at the training ground just twice a week with her players. Meanwhile, several of her coaches perform more than one role at the club, and even the squad itself is split between full and part-time playing contracts. For Hayes the day cannot come soon enough that everyone is a full-time professional.</p> <p>For now, though, she is thrilled to be working for a club that has given her \xe2\x80\x9ccarte blanche\xe2\x80\x9d to create her own vision. \xe2\x80\x9cI think Chelsea have been smart about it, they want to make sure the foundations are solid and that Chelsea Ladies will be around forever \xe2\x80\xa6 make history.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>With the title race on a knife edge, Liverpool one point behind and chomping at the bit \xe2\x80\x93 albeit with a tougher run-in \xe2\x80\x93 and Birmingham also in the equation, it is Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s to lose.</p> <p>Hayes shakes her head, no. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re playing for something bigger than ourselves. We\xe2\x80\x99re playing for our young players to go on to be professional. I want success for so many people. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give a crap about myself. It feels like I\xe2\x80\x99m in a very selfless place in my life. And I feel blessed. I\xe2\x80\x99m relaxed. I feel that this is what I was supposed to be doing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
