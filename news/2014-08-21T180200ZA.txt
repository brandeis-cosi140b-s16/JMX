b'Arsenal players get revenge on referee with ice bucket challenge nomination'


b'<p>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Kieran Gibbs have both taken on the ice bucket challenge and, perhaps as retribution for the fact he mixed the Arsenal pair of them up last year, have nominated the referee Andre Marriner to also undergo the charity craze in which a bucket of cold water is poured over the participant\xe2\x80\x99s head.</p>       <p>Following a day in which the Chelsea manager Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho also had a bucket of icy water dunked over his head, the Arsenal footballers joined in. Oxlade-Chamberlain nominated the Liverpool player Raheem Sterling, while Gibbs named the former Arsenal right back Bacary Sagna, who has now left the club to play for Manchester City.</p> <p>But the pair both jointly named Marriner after he sent off Gibbs last season when he meant to show the red card to Oxlade-Chamberlain. Marriner apologised for his blunder after the game \xe2\x80\x93 a 6-0 defeat against Chelsea \xe2\x80\x93 but the Arsenal pair apparently feel his words do not go far enough, appearing to relish the chance to serve up their revenge as icily cold as possible.</p>'
