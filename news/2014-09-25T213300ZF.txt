b'Frank Lampard says it is possible he will extend Manchester City stay'


b'<p>New York City Football Club will oppose any move from Manchester City to extend Frank Lampard\xe2\x80\x99s loan deal.</p> <p> The midfielder is currently contracted to play for the champions until 1 January. Yet after City\xe2\x80\x99s 7-0 defeat of Sheffield Wednesday in Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s Capital One Cup third-round tie at the Etihad, Manuel Pellegrini said it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot impossible\xe2\x80\x9d for Lampard to remain for longer.</p> <p>Speaking before the comments from City\xe2\x80\x99s manager, Jason Kreis, the NYC coach, said: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no truth in this rumour at all.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>NYC have made Lampard a major part of their marketing structure, with his planned appearance for the new MLS franchise at the beginning of the new season in mid-March having a sizeable effect on season tickets. NYC\xe2\x80\x99s pre-season starts in January and the club want Lampard to be part of that.</p> <p>Yet speaking after scoring twice against Wednesday to make it three goals in two appearances, the 36-year-old suggested he was open to staying at City longer. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not my place to do that. Obviously it would be a club decision, first and foremost, anyway. I will train and play as well as I can and the rest is up to the club.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Given that Lampard will have been playing for City he would not need a pre-season before featuring for NYC so could join the club later. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat argument has come up since I scored at the weekend. The important thing for me is to train well, play well if I can, and then see what happens. I signed on here till January so that is all I can say at the minute.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of the move to City, Lampard said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a tester for me to come here. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to make this decision. But it was a very good opportunity to train and play at this level which arose. It is a personal test to come up to Manchester and be up here for this six months, or five months, whatever it is.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was very much in a comfort zone at Chelsea. I worked at Chelsea for 13 years, trained there, played there, and now it is different. All I can say is that I am enjoying it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been proud of my fitness and trying to keep as fit and fresh as I can.</p> <p>At the end of the day I\xe2\x80\x99m very fortunate. Not many players at the age of 36 get the opportunity to come and play among these players. When you look around the dressing room there is so much quality, and that is a real honour for me to come and play amongst that.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI feel good. It was a funny one for me. It was my intention to have a longer holiday and then train maybe only at home or with a fitness coach. I was in pure holiday mode when I got the call to come back here. And, fortunately enough, I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a really good pre-season considering I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t involved in the first few games. There\xe2\x80\x99s been extra training time for me and I feel fit, feel good, and actually realy enjoying training and playing.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s good, the lads are great, Brian Kidd, people behind the scenes, have been brilliant and it\xe2\x80\x99s been an easy transition.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
