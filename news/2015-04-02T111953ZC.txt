b"Carly Telford: 'It would be nice to bring the Champions League to Nottingham'"


b'<p>Hello Carly! Hi there, Small Talk!</p> <p>So, the new Women\xe2\x80\x99s Super League season is just starting out. What have you been up to all winter? Well the season ended at the start of October but we had to carry on training because we had a couple of internationals, so until then we weren\xe2\x80\x99t allowed to do anything except the normal routine. We had a game at Wembley at the end of November, and then December\xe2\x80\x99s our holiday month, so I went away for two weeks, came back, had Christmas and New Year at home with the family, and then come 5 January I was back in for pre-season.</p> <p>Your team, Notts County, came sixth last year. What are you hoping for this season? Our ambitions are a lot higher. We started out last season quite ambitious, with the squad that we had, but we had major injuries \xe2\x80\x93 four ACLs, all to starters \xe2\x80\x93 so we lost four key players for the whole season. But since then we\xe2\x80\x99ve strengthened and we\xe2\x80\x99ve got them players back. At the back we\xe2\x80\x99re pretty solid. We conceded the least goals last year. So if we can add to our defensive record then we should be looking alright.</p> <p>So significantly higher than sixth, then? That\xe2\x80\x99s the ambition, yeah. Champions League is a massive carrot for us. It would be nice to bring Champions League football to Nottingham. The city\xe2\x80\x99s been deprived of anything like that and it would be good to bring it to a real footballing city if we can. So a top two finish. Obviously if we can go and win the league it would be brilliant. It\xe2\x80\x99s not impossible, with the group that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got. And the cups are there along the way.</p> <p>If not you, who\xe2\x80\x99s going to win the league? It was strong last year, but this year it\xe2\x80\x99s strengthened. The big three of Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea will be up and around there, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99ll be tight. Birmingham have strengthened, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve got Liverpool who ended up winning last year. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t pick a winner. Sometimes teams, perhaps like ourselves, on paper they might not have the stars but when it comes to playing, everyone hates playing us because they know we\xe2\x80\x99re a good side. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to pick, but I\xe2\x80\x99d like to think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be around it.</p> <p>What about star players? Who are the Messis and Ronaldos of the WSL? You\xe2\x80\x99ve probably heard of Eniola Eluko, she\xe2\x80\x99s a fantastic player at Chelsea, probably one of the starlets. Defensively you\xe2\x80\x99ve got Alex Scott at Arsenal and Steph Houghton, the England captain. They\xe2\x80\x99re all players kids can look up to, from small towns, girls who were kicking the ball on the back lanes with the boys. That\xe2\x80\x99s where we all came from and now look where we are. It gives every kid hope \xe2\x80\x93 even little boys. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just girls who come along and want to be like us. That\xe2\x80\x99s a real strange thing, but they just enjoy the game, and enjoy watching us score goals and save shots. That\xe2\x80\x99s the beauty of kids, they don\xe2\x80\x99t judge things, they just want to enjoy the game.</p> <p>You were on the bench when England played Germany at Wembley last year, in front of 45,000 people. What was that like? It\xe2\x80\x99s something you dream of as a kid. Everybody wants to play on the hallowed turf. I might not have played on it, but I certainly got to walk out and experience the atmosphere. It\xe2\x80\x99s something I\xe2\x80\x99ll always remember, being one of the first players to do that. It was quite a useful experience, coming into the World Cup, with the big crowd. Because at club games we\xe2\x80\x99ll get between a thousand and maybe three thousand, then to walk out in front of 45,000, everything sort of changes. I think crowds will be like that in Canada, so it\xe2\x80\x99ll be useful experience, and it was important for the women\xe2\x80\x99s game, to pull in a decent crowd. Hopefully there\xe2\x80\x99ll be another one for the FA Cup final at Wembley this year.</p> <p>Can you sense a rising interest in the women\xe2\x80\x99s game? Yeah. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite interesting. When I go to get my hair done or my nails done or whatever, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll recognise my accent\xe2\x80\x99s not local, they\xe2\x80\x99ll say, \xe2\x80\x98So why are you in Nottingham?\xe2\x80\x99 And I\xe2\x80\x99ll tell them I play football, and they\xe2\x80\x99re like, \xe2\x80\x98Ah, isn\xe2\x80\x99t women\xe2\x80\x99s football on the up?\xe2\x80\x99 So they know about it, and they\xe2\x80\x99re beauticians and hairdressers and whatever, not really people who pay attention to football at all. But in the last few years Sky Sports have got on board, BT, BBC, they\xe2\x80\x99re all really pushing it. And it\xe2\x80\x99s nice that we have that now, because it gives young girls something to look forward to, that they can be on TV and whatever. When I was around the 17, 18 mark a lot of girls my age dropped out of football, good players, because there was no lifestyle there. There was no money in it, no future in it. But now a lot of us are full-time and enjoying the game as a job.</p> <p>You first played in goal when your mum gave you a long-sleeved Sunderland goalkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s jersey to wear to training because she thought it was too chilly for a short-sleeved one. As a lifelong Newcastle fan, though, what were you doing with a Sunderland top in the first place? Yeah, I was confused by that as well. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where she got it. I think that, because it was my first trial at this club, she\xe2\x80\x99d gone out and thought, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ll buy a couple of new things.\xe2\x80\x99 I think I was looking a bit straggly, so she bought me a new pair of socks and some shorts. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether my Newcastle top was dirty, because I probably wore it every day knowing me, so she\xe2\x80\x99d bought me this. It was one of those old-school ones that was really thick and it had padding on the arms all the way down. I remember it was freezing, stood there. The guy said, \xe2\x80\x98I thought you played outfield but if you want to play in goal that\xe2\x80\x99s alright.\xe2\x80\x99 I just wanted to play, so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to say no. Next minute I was in goal and I never came back out. That season I was Under-13 player of the league, manager\xe2\x80\x99s player of the year, player\xe2\x80\x99s player of the league, and it just escalated from there really. Mum takes all the credit.</p> <p>Then you got scouted by Sunderland at 14, a call-up to England\xe2\x80\x99s Under-17s at 15 \xe2\x80\x93 it all came very quickly for you. I did have one knockback. When I was 14 I had a trial at Liverpool, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get picked for that and I was heartbroken. I thought that was it for me. Then I played for Sunderland, and from there I got selected for England. So yeah, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been very lucky, very blessed. I was hindered by injury for a couple of years, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve had a blessed career. I\xe2\x80\x99d just turned 15 when I went to my first Under-19 tournament, and then went away with the Under-21s, and I was 18 when I got my first call-up to the seniors. So I\xe2\x80\x99ve been around the England team for nearly 10 years now, and not many people can say that. But I haven\xe2\x80\x99t played enough \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99ve probably only got about 10 caps to my name, and I\xe2\x80\x99d have like a little bit more.</p> <p>Is it a frustration that you\xe2\x80\x99ve been in so many squads but played so little? It is. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard, being a goalkeeper, because there\xe2\x80\x99s a No1. You understand how it works. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been there or thereabouts and if I look at the keepers ahead of me, Rachel Brown probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t get her first regular run in the team until she was 25 or 26; Karen Bardsley, I think she was 29 when she played first and she\xe2\x80\x99s now consistently No1. So probably between 26 and 29 is when you start coming into things as a goalkeeper, and I\xe2\x80\x99m 27 now. They look for experience in a keeper, so it\xe2\x80\x99s learning that, and just to keep a level head and keep wanting to be better. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a frustrating place to be, knowing that you\xe2\x80\x99re there but not quite there. Having said that, it\xe2\x80\x99s an honour to be involved, and my time will come I\xe2\x80\x99m sure.</p>     Carly Telford in the dressing room prior to the WSL match between Notts County Ladies and Chelsea Ladies at Meadow Lane last weekend. Chelsea won 2-1. Photograph: Jon Buckle - The FA/The FA via Getty Images    <p>You\xe2\x80\x99re 5ft 7in, a lot shorter than most top-level male goalkeepers. Is that an issue at all? It\xe2\x80\x99s funny you should mention that. Goalkeepers get criticised a lot for getting lobbed, so we\xe2\x80\x99ve had to learn as females that because we\xe2\x80\x99re not as tall we have to find an area that\xe2\x80\x99s best for us. We might have to work on our angles more than some of the guys would, and can\xe2\x80\x99t have as high a starting position. Because the girls can hit it as far and as hard as the men, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t hold back \xe2\x80\x93 so if you\xe2\x80\x99re not in goal they\xe2\x80\x99re going to ping one over your head. You see the guys out of their box and patrolling outside their area, and standing outside the six-yard box to save shots from 18 yards, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to do that because we\xe2\x80\x99re only little, and our range in stretching and stuff is far smaller. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we were taught enough at a young age about that, and that\xe2\x80\x99s kind of to our detriment, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why you still see a lot of goals going over people\xe2\x80\x99s heads, but it\xe2\x80\x99s getting better. The coaching\xe2\x80\x99s getting better, and people are more aware of the women\xe2\x80\x99s game and how it\xe2\x80\x99s a little different to the men\xe2\x80\x99s. The outfielders have advanced so far that we\xe2\x80\x99re now playing catch-up with them lot.</p> <p>You were the player of the match in the 2008 FA Cup final even though your team, Leeds, lost 4-1 to Arsenal. How does that work? It\xe2\x80\x99s hard explaining that to someone who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there. I think there were 35 shots on target and only four goals scored. I must have made about 25 or 30 saves in the game. It was kind of like a bombardment, but I came out smelling of roses somehow. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how. It was mixed emotions, because everyone was talking about how well I\xe2\x80\x99d played, but I\xe2\x80\x99d lost. I\xe2\x80\x99d rather do nothing all game and be stood on the podium with a winner\xe2\x80\x99s medal, but that\xe2\x80\x99s how it goes. It was memorable in a good and bad way for me. We still talk about that day, when I see some of the other girls. It was about 30C, and we just defended for our lives, for 90 minutes.</p> <p>What music do you like to listen to? I\xe2\x80\x99m very generic, I listen to all sorts of stuff. I have a playlist I listen to sometimes on game day, with a lot of stuff from movie soundtracks. Stuff from Lord of the Rings, Batman, stuff like that. I find that gets me pumped sometimes. But in general it can be anything from RnB, I love a little house and dance trance, to the slow, soppy stuff. Honestly, if you were to look at my Spotify you\xe2\x80\x99d be like, \xe2\x80\x98What is wrong with this person?\xe2\x80\x99 There\xe2\x80\x99s no conformity to it at all, it\xe2\x80\x99s just all over.</p> <p>Do you get to many concerts? I\xe2\x80\x99d like to go to more but football always ruins everything. I\xe2\x80\x99d love to go to some festivals. I went to the Summer Stampede that Mumford &amp; Sons headlined in 2013, and that was amazing. I love them and I was over the moon to see them live, it was a baking hot day and it was brilliant. That was probably my last concert. They\xe2\x80\x99re always at night-time when we\xe2\x80\x99ve got training, or at the weekend when we\xe2\x80\x99ve got games, and I can\xe2\x80\x99t get to festivals because we play in the summer.</p> <p>What about the cinema, then? Well I don\xe2\x80\x99t really like the cinema, because you just sit there for three hours not doing anything, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t really like that. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind watching a DVD, though. I\xe2\x80\x99m a real comedy girl. I like to have a good laugh. Nothing emotional \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m not a cryer at all. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like to see animals getting hurt, or people who fall in love and then someone dies. I like to enjoy my movies. Bridesmaids was a big one. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a go-to movie if you\xe2\x80\x99re having a movie night.</p> <p>So who\xe2\x80\x99d play you in a film of your life? Someone like that chick out of Twilight, what\xe2\x80\x99s her name? [Small Talk supplies her name]. Yeah, Kristen Stewart. She\xe2\x80\x99s quite cool, quite chilled but quite feisty as well and a bit of a tomboy. We\xe2\x80\x99ll go with that.</p> <p>The Queen\xe2\x80\x99s coming over for dinner. What are you going to cook for her? Oh she\xe2\x80\x99d have to have one of my specialities. So sweet potato mash, with sausages \xe2\x80\x93 proper good sausages, though, none of those cheap ones. Off a farm, with loads of herbs in \xe2\x80\x93 and some good old onion and mushroom gravy all over the top of it.</p> <p>That sounds right up her street, actually. Right, it\xe2\x80\x99s my round, what are you having?I\xe2\x80\x99ll have a Steamboat [it\xe2\x80\x99s a Southern Comfort-based cocktail], with soda and lime. Make it a double, thanks. A treble, if you\xe2\x80\x99re paying.</p> <p>I\xe2\x80\x99m not, it\xe2\x80\x99s on expenses, so go wild. Who\xe2\x80\x99d win a fight between a lion and a tiger? A tiger. Because the tiger out of the Jungle Book looks really mean, and lions sometimes look not as mean.</p> <p>Right. Finally, can you tell us a joke? A joke? Hang on [runs around asking everyone near her if they can think of a joke, until someone says they can]. What do you call a donkey with three legs? A wonkey.</p> <p>Well we\xe2\x80\x99re going to need some time to control our mirth after that one. Thanks Carly!
