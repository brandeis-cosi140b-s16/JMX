b'Tottenham Hotspur v Manchester City: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>Well, that was entertaining, knockabout end-of-season fare, with Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero\xe2\x80\x99s clinical goal on the break the difference. Spurs had more possession, and made plenty of chances, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find a breakthrough as the visiting defence slowly got their act together.</p> <p>On the day Chelsea took their title, Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s team might not be shouting from the rooftops about a 1-0 win \xe2\x80\x93 but that\xe2\x80\x99s a third straight victory, and the brief challenge to their top four status has been snuffed out with minimum fuss. Thanks for joining me. Bye!</p>'
