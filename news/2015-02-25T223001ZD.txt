b'Destiny calls for Mauricio Pochettino as Spurs eye double glory'


b'<p>Mauricio Pochettino has admitted he will be judged on his team selection for two crucial games that could define Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s season, with the manager well aware his decisions will prove pivotal against Fiorentina and Chelsea.</p> <p>Spurs play the Serie A club in the last 32 of the Europa League in Florence on Thursday night needing to score if they are to stand any chance of progressing after a 1-1 draw at White Hart Lane. They will then train at Coverciano in Italy on Friday rather than fly home immediately after the game, with Pochettino believing a good night\xe2\x80\x99s rest will be paramount to his side\xe2\x80\x99s chances in the Capital One Cup final on Sunday.</p> <p>Beating Chelsea at Wembley would secure a first trophy in seven years for Spurs, yet Pochettino said Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s game carried equal significance in the context of their campaign.</p> <p>Harry Kane appeared only as a second-half substitute last week against Vincenzo Montella\xe2\x80\x99s Fiorentina and could again start on the bench alongside Christian Eriksen, with Pochettino admitting his team selection over the two games will be scrutinised.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe problem is the decision you take is always about the result you get,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf tomorrow you make the rotation and after on Sunday you win, you are a genius. Sunday you may rest some players and play others and win the final \xe2\x80\x93 genius. If you lose tomorrow and the final, you are a bad manager and coach.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the same coach but when you take a decision sometimes you are right or wrong, but this is football. We take a decision to try to win tomorrow and play better than Fiorentina. After we analyse again and try to put the best team out for the final on Sunday.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s predicament has been heightened by a congested fixture list for Spurs. Fiorentina, unbeaten in 10 matches, came from behind to secure a first-leg draw and sit fifth in Serie A. Their former Liverpool midfielder Alberto Aquilani dismissed as \xe2\x80\x9cabsurd\xe2\x80\x9d suggestions that Tottenham could be distracted by Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s final.</p> <p>Emmanuel Adebayor and Youn\xc3\xa8s Kaboul were among the players who did not make the cut for Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s squad. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very busy period, difficult for the players,\xe2\x80\x9d the manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe decided to stay here in Florence after the game, to train here.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think this is very important, to sleep well after the game, to eat well and recover. Sunday is another final and we need to do everything for our players to arrive fresh on Sunday. After, when we go back to London, we will decide the squad for the final. The problem is that we have 25 to 26 players in the squad and it is difficult to bring everyone here.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Tottenham will have 2,200 supporters at the Stadio Artemio Franchi and there will be a significant police presence in the city after unsavoury scenes in Rome last week following Roma\xe2\x80\x99s game against Feyenoord. An alcohol ban has been put in place and 1,300 police offers will be deployed in the vicinity of the stadium.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOur supporters in the last three games \xe2\x80\x93 in Turkey, Greece and Serbia \xe2\x80\x93 our behaviour has been fantastic,\xe2\x80\x9d Pochettino said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to make sure tomorrow is the same. It is another day to enjoy the game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Fiorentina (4-3-3, probable): Neto; Richards, Savic, Rodr\xc3\xadguez, Pasqual; Fern\xc3\xa1ndez, Pizarro, Aquillani; Joaqu\xc3\xadn, Gomez, Salah.</p> <p>Tottenham (4-2-3-1, probable) Lloris; Walker, Fazio, Vertonghen, Davies; Bentaleb, Stambouli; Demb\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9, Lamela, Chadli; Soldado.</p> <p>Referee H Gocek (Tur)</p> <p>BT Sport 2, kick-off 6pm</p>'
