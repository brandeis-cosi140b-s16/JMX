b'Football transfer rumours: Arsenal eye R\xc3\xa9my and Welbeck after Giroud injury?'


b'<p>Ah, the smell of desperation in the morning. With just a week until the The Transfer Window\xe2\x84\xa2 slams shut\xc2\xa9, the clever businessmen who\xe2\x80\x99ve indulged in summer-long games of brinkmanship suddenly have to achieve things.</p> <p>Manchester United, for example, in need of a central midfield since Palaeolithic times, have finally decided to acquire one. Of course, this is a circumstance they might have been dealt with while they were on top, rather than following a second consecutive miserable start to the season, but where\xe2\x80\x99s the challenge in that? So, despite having no interest in him whatsoever, they intend to acquire Arturo Vidal for a fee of \xc2\xa334m \xe2\x80\x93 and, perhaps, Javier Hern\xc3\xa1ndez. Quite what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with football when the totem of Juventus, the Italian champions, can be financially muscled to England\xe2\x80\x99s seventh-best team, no one appears quite sure.</p> <p>And United are also thought to be close to signing Ajax\xe2\x80\x99s Daley Blind \xe2\x80\x93 the \xe2\x80\x9cdeluxe O\xe2\x80\x99Shea\xe2\x80\x9d, to give him his catalogue moniker. Neither the Secret Seven nor the Famous Five could solve the mystery why this signing has taken so long to effect; why, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost enough to make a person wonder whether they really want him at all.</p> <p>Lastly, United are still in with a shot of nabbing Mehdi Benatia. He, apparently, planned to go to Bayern Munich, but Roma cancelled a meeting between the clubs, unimpressed with the offer they received prior to it. United are said to be reviewing the situation \xe2\x80\x93 and Arsenal too. They have yet to replace Thomas Vermaelen, while, in a development of pure, concentrated, distilled intrigue, Roma are reportedly close to agreeing a deal with Olympiakos for Kostas Manolas, replacing Benatia with Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s intended replacement for Vermaelen.</p> <p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger is also still seeking a non-tricksy midfielder and a serious centre-forward, sparking rumours as with the imminent arrival of Godot. In particular, he likes William Carvalho, for whom Sporting Lisbon were asking \xc2\xa335m \xe2\x80\x93 or, put another way, \xc2\xa31m for each appearance he has made in their shirt. But they\xe2\x80\x99ve since reduced the price to a bargainalicious \xc2\xa324m \xe2\x80\x93 though would like the player back on loan should they be unable to find a replacement, and are also interested in taking Yaya Sanogo, Serge Gnabry, Francis Coquelin and Ryo Miyaichi in part-exchange.</p> <p>And Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s search for a striker has also intensified, with Olivier Giroud sustaining an injury that might keep him out for as long as three months. Wenger is, apparently, evaluating the various merits of Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my and Danny Welbeck while also considering a temporary move for Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o \xe2\x80\x93 though he is close to signing for Everton.</p> <p>Across London, Chelsea have found themselves unable to refrain from joining in the fun. According to Claudio Vigorelli \xe2\x80\x93 the agent of Mattia Destro, obviously \xe2\x80\x93 they and Milan are keen on the Roma striker, who is \xe2\x80\x9cat the centre of some important situations that could develop\xe2\x80\x9d, whatever that means.</p> <p>Nor are the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s August champions-elect sitting idly by; Spurs still plan to trouble Sevilla for their captain and centre-back, Federico Fazio, having decided that he is worth his release clause. He will replace Michael Dawson, whose long-mooted relocation to Hull appears imminent. And talking of Hull, they still think that they can entice Blackburn to sell them Jordan Rhodes, who is thinking about requesting a transfer in an attempt to force things through.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Sunderland would like a go of Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Sebasti\xc3\xa1n Coates, while they, West Brom and QPR fancy themselves Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s midfielder, Andy King. And, finally for today, QPR are close to acquiring a left-back, expecting to conclude a deal for Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Jack Robinson faster than you can say Jack Robinson.</p>'
