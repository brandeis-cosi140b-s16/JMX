b'Bradford play mind games as they seek FA Cup advantage over Reading'


b'<p>Bradford City\xe2\x80\x99s players sometimes call him \xe2\x80\x9cthe lifeguard\xe2\x80\x9d but, to Reading, John Muranka represents a hidden enemy. For the past five years the West Yorkshire-based psychologist-cum-life coach has been working with assorted Bradford first-teamers, doing his bit to help them reach the 2013 League Cup final, win promotion to League One and, most recently, giant-kill their way to the FA Cup quarter-finals.</p> <p>During a run in which Phil Parkinson\xe2\x80\x99s side have bundled Chelsea and Sunderland out of a competition which on Saturday sees them host Reading, Muranka has been \xe2\x80\x9cmind coaching\xe2\x80\x9d two of City\xe2\x80\x99s leading scorers, James Hanson and Billy Clarke.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWith goalscorers it\xe2\x80\x99s about relaxing,\xe2\x80\x9d says Muranka. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of pressure on strikers and when they feel pressure they tighten up and can start snatching at shots. So we do relaxation exercises.\xe2\x80\x9d These have proved so effective that Bradford players often record his instructions on their mobiles and listen to them in the dressing room before games.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMind and body are totally linked. Something that affects us mentally or emotionally also does so physically, and vice versa,\xe2\x80\x9d the 57-year-old says. \xe2\x80\x9cA player suddenly makes a mistake in a game, they beat themselves up about it, they waste mental energy and their whole performance is affected. They have to learn to live in the present, in the moment, and just think about making the next header or tackle or shot.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Muranka had already established a broad client base in the business and sports spheres when, back in 2010, he decided to see if he could help his beloved Bradford. As a Valley Parade season ticket holder his study of the home side\xe2\x80\x99s body language suggested scope for mental strengthening and Peter Taylor, then City\xe2\x80\x99s manager, agreed, initially inviting him to work with a couple of players.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPeter was very open to what I do,\xe2\x80\x9d says Muranka. It helped that back in the 1970s, when Taylor starred for Tottenham Hotspur, the late John Syer had served as the \xe2\x80\x9cmind doctor\xe2\x80\x9d at White Hart Lane.</p> <p>At the time Syer\xe2\x80\x99s work was groundbreaking but Taylor and his team-mates noted that it got results. Four decades on, sports psychology is a central part of life at several Premier League clubs. However, some managers remain unconvinced of its merits, not to mention unwilling to cede an element of control to an \xe2\x80\x9coutsider\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Fortunately for Muranka, Parkinson is a believer. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what would happen when Peter Taylor left Bradford,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Phil\xe2\x80\x99s a very modern, very open-minded manager who has always been interested in psychology. If he feels a player might benefit from working with me then he\xe2\x80\x99ll suggest a meeting between the three of us. Phil will then detail the areas of the player\xe2\x80\x99s game where he believes I can help, and explain how much he believes in sports psychology. Then I have a first meeting with the player. I always say: \xe2\x80\x98If it isn\xe2\x80\x99t for you, then don\xe2\x80\x99t worry.\xe2\x80\x99 But invariably they come back. They tell me that what we do often helps them in other areas of their lives.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In an era when nutrition, physical conditioning and computerised performance analysis have all been advanced to what would once have been regarded as science-fictional levels, ignoring the psychological side of things would appear to be a monumental oversight. \xe2\x80\x9cAs Virginia Wade said: \xe2\x80\x98Once you reach a certain level, technically tennis is 95% what happens in the mind,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d says Muranka.</p> <p>If, to varying extents, all humans have a capacity for self-destruction, then no one is immune from the sort of negative thinking that, for a footballer, can represent career suicide. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s part of being human,\xe2\x80\x9d says Muranka. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all have inner voices saying: \xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t do that\xe2\x80\x99 or: \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t try that.\xe2\x80\x99 The negative side of your mind is more dominant than the positive side, so you have to work hard to replace negative thoughts with positive ones.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>By way of helping his clients control their mindset he recalls a trip he took to the US in the 1970s. The young Muranka was fascinated by the way waitresses automatically kept topping his coffee cup up in diners but swiftly realised how easy it was to reach caffeine overload.</p> <p>Negative thoughts can exert a similarly debilitating effect. \xe2\x80\x9cJust as you had to make the effort to put your hand over your cup and say: \xe2\x80\x98No thank you, I\xe2\x80\x99ll have tea now please\xe2\x80\x99, you have to cancel the negative thoughts and fill your mind up with positives ones . If you make sure the cup\xe2\x80\x99s filled with tea there\xe2\x80\x99s no room for coffee anymore and it\xe2\x80\x99s the same with positive thinking. When you worry about not doing well your body tends to prepare you for failure. But when you relax, your talent can shine through.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Hanson has relished putting theory into practice. \xe2\x80\x9cPhil told me that, when he was playing, seeing a sports psychologist probably improved his game by 2-3%, so if it\xe2\x80\x99s doing that, then it\xe2\x80\x99s a no-brainer,\xe2\x80\x9d says the striker. \xe2\x80\x9cI really enjoy seeing John. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a quick fix; the first month you don\xe2\x80\x99t notice anything much. But it does work over time.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSince I\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeing John I feel that it\xe2\x80\x99s helped with all parts of my game. I\xe2\x80\x99ve scored quite a lot of goals, so he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously doing something right.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
