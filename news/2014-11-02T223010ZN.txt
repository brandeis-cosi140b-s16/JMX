b'Nathaniel Clyne shows England form for Southampton in Hull win'


b'<p>Nathaniel Clyne\xe2\x80\x99s role in Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s well-oiled defensive machine has put him on the verge of an international debut. The fact that the England manager, Roy Hodgson, was in attendance to witness his latest performance first hand will only have increased the probability of it happening within the next fortnight.</p> <p>Hodgson \xe2\x80\x93 who this week will reveal his squad for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia on 15 November and the friendly with Scotland three days later \xe2\x80\x93 has chosen Clyne before but is yet to play him. At the KC Stadium, the 23-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s all-round play was exceptional: a modern-day Cafu roving the right flank, a wrecking ball in defence. Such is his confidence both in his own ability and that of the disciplined team for which he plays that at times it was easy to forget he was stationed at full-back.</p> <p>There were half a dozen Englishmen for Hodgson to consider as in-form Southampton made it 10 wins in 11 attempts but it was the uncapped Clyne who outshone his club colleagues Fraser Forster and Ryan Bertrand, and the three lesser lights of Hull, Curtis Davies, Tom Huddlestone and Jake Livermore. Southampton sold Calum Chambers to Arsenal for a fee that could rise to \xc2\xa316m over the summer but time may yet prove they kept a long-term international.</p> <p>Asked if he believed he had done enough to retain his place in the squad, Clyne was unequivocal. \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, definitely. I think I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the ability to play for my country. Hopefully I can get the call up next time. If you play well then you get picked up. I\xe2\x80\x99m playing with lots of confidence. The players that are playing with me are helping me to get on, we are performing well and hopefully we can continue it.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs a full-back, I like to get forward and help out in attack. If I can get assists or score goals myself, then I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it. With the centre-backs covering me, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the ability to go forward.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s collective work at the back \xe2\x80\x93 this was their sixth clean sheet and they have shipped an average of a goal every other game so far this season \xe2\x80\x93 was testament to the hours spent on the training ground honing their formation with their coach, Ronald Koeman. \xe2\x80\x9cWe work hard on our defensive shape and it shows during games. We\xe2\x80\x99re solid and we\xe2\x80\x99re tough to beat. They only had one shot at goal. If you keep a clean sheet, you\xe2\x80\x99ve always got a chance of winning a game or getting a result that we need. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to continue the trend, be solid and score goals as well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Even when Hull got around the outside, as they did several times in the opening period after falling behind, Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s defenders recovered to regain possession with interceptions, blocks or precision tackles reminiscent of the Dutchman Koeman in his prime. It may not have been their prettiest display but it spoke of the spirit that Koeman has instilled \xe2\x80\x93 it was their third hard-fought victory in eight days, following a league and cup double over Stoke.</p> <p>They remain four points behind Chelsea courtesy of Victor Wanyama\xe2\x80\x99s stunning third-minute strike, an effort that arrowed into the exposed net after Hull\xe2\x80\x99s third-choice goalkeeper, Eldin Jakupovic, mishit a clearance under pressure from the marauding Graziano Pell\xc3\xa8.</p> <p>It was not the first time that Jakupovic, who has won one cap for Switzerland, has blundered at the KC Stadium. Indeed, on his previous league appearance there 21 months earlier he fumbled a corner into the net to gift Sheffield Wednesday a surprise victory. However, Steve Bruce refused to condemn his goalkeeper, who had been impressive deputising for the injured pair Allan McGregor and Steve Harper a week earlier when Liverpool were shut out at Anfield.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the life of a goalkeeper. If you make a mistake there, you usually get punished and you want your mates to pull you out the crap. Unfortunately, we weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to do that,\xe2\x80\x9d the Hull manager said.</p> <p>The home side\xe2\x80\x99s attacking play has been limited since Nikica Jelavic injured his knee in the warm-up at Arsenal a fortnight ago. They scored in each of their opening eight Premier League fixtures but Clyne and his team ensured a second successive blank, with Hatem Ben Arfa\xe2\x80\x99s tame effort straight at Forster their only one on target.</p> <p>Bruce remained gracious in defeat and sounded one for the underdog when he welcomed Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s position among the Champions League places. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s hope they stay there. There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason they can\xe2\x80\x99t, if they can stay injury-free. They were a really good side last year, a top, top team. To be fair to everyone at Southampton, they can take a big pat on the back because their recruitment has gone extremely well. They\xe2\x80\x99ve brought some very good players to the club and they\xe2\x80\x99ve all adapted to life in England very well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Man of match Nathaniel Clyne (Southampton)</p>'
