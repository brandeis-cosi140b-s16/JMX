b'Football transfer rumours: Radamel Falcao on his way to Chelsea?'


b'<p>Anyone who has ever watched Magnolia or Amores Perros (yes, the Mill\xe2\x80\x99s cultural references all stem from 2000 or earlier) will be well aware of the pleasure to be found in a plot woven from several intricately linked stories, each one overlapping with the next to create one overarching and satisfying whole. And there\xe2\x80\x99s more than a hint of that about today\xe2\x80\x99s tales from the tabloids. Apart from the \xe2\x80\x9csatisfaction\xe2\x80\x9d bit obviously. Oh, and the \xe2\x80\x9cpleasure\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>We kick off at Stamford Bridge. After bagging a second Premier League title Branislav Ivanovic will be looking for pastures new, according to the Daily Star. Bayern Munich want the Serbian to rumble up and down their right flank next season.</p> <p>[WE CUT TO JOS\xc3\x89 MOURINHO LOOKING WISTFUL ON A HORSE.]</p> <p>Chelsea will look to offset that disappointment by making a summer move for Radamel Falcao. Manchester United don\xe2\x80\x99t want him but the Colombian wants to stay in the Premier League and, despite the evidence of his first seven months in England, Mourinho wants to offer him the opportunity to do so. Tottenham are also keen, while Valencia would offer an unlikely route back to Spain.</p> <p>[FALCAO TRAINING MONTAGE. IN SOME SNOW. AFTER 10 MINUTES OF SHANKING SHOTS WIDE OF GOAL HE FINALLY TAPS ONE IN FROM A YARD OUT. FIST PUMP.]</p> <p>Falcao\xe2\x80\x99s departure means United will join the summer\xe2\x80\x99s big transfer tug of war. Danny Ings is wanted by Liverpool, Tottenham and Real Sociedad and has been scouted by Manchester City and Chelsea but he wants a move to Old Trafford and United want him.</p> <p>[EXTREME CLOSE UP OF DAVID MOYES\xe2\x80\x99S FACE.

And with Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s future hanging by a thread, Rafael Ben\xc3\xadtez has jumped to the head of the queue for the Etihad hot seat next season.</p> <p>[TASTEFUL-THOUGH-ALMOST-CERTAINLY-NOT-ESSENTIAL-TO-THE-PLOT SEX SCENE]</p> <p>Tottenham will brush off defeat in the battle for Ings and instead go toe-to-toe with Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid over PSG\xe2\x80\x99s Ezequiel Lavezzi, while across north London Arsenal are lining up a \xc2\xa319m move for Bayern Leverkusen attacking midfielder Hakan Calhanoglu.</p> <p>[JEFF GOLDBLUM FINALLY WORKS THE WHOLE THING OUT.]</p> <p>And just before the closing credits, it\xe2\x80\x99s revealed that Liverpool have been the shadowy puppet master behind the maelstrom of interlocking tales and that their move for Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s Daryl Janmaat is the key to everything, though no one really knows why.</p> <p>[ROLL CREDITS]</p>'
