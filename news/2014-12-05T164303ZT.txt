b'BIASED, UNFAIR AND OUTRAGEOUS <p>Well, there was no football to speak of on Thursday night. Which is the saddest night of the football week? Monday is often a contender; so too Friday. Thursday is overlooked in this regard. After the midweek frolics, a football-free Thursday is no hair of the dog. Unless there is some Big Vase. That\xe2\x80\x99s always good. But Friday is the saddest. Maybe you will agree after you\xe2\x80\x99ve digested this Friday Fiver. So with nothing to look back on, let\xe2\x80\x99s look forward to the weekend.</p> <p>Chelsea and Manchester City will resume hostilities, although not against each other. Imagine if they played each other 38 times and the other 18 Premier League teams had their own division? Maybe it will happen. Maybe it already has. Because, between them, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho and Manuel Pellegrini have got the title sewn up, haven\xe2\x80\x99t they?</p> <p>Chelsea play away against Newcastle at lunchtime on Saturday; Manchester City are at home to Everton, four hours and 45 minutes later. They both play in Big Cup on Wednesday. For Chelsea, the home game against Sporting is a meaningless match, for City, group game six is, er, meaningful.</p> <p>So why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t Pellegrini complained about his later kick-off time on Saturday? The Fiver can think of one or two managers who would. You know the drill. In this age of laser-cut athletes, every minute is vital in their preparation and recovery time. Pellegrini should be standing on the highest part of the Etihad Stadium, with a megaphone directly piped into the Premier League offices, saying that the Premier League doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care about English teams in Europe. That City should be playing Everton on Friday night. Or should have played them two weeks ago. Or in late August \xe2\x80\xa6 of 2012. That everyone knew City would make a pig\xe2\x80\x99s ear of four of their first five group matches and that away against Roma, their final group game, was always going to be the clincher.</p> <p>But, no, the former O\xe2\x80\x99Higgins and Palestino manager has so far remained unmoved by this egregious discrepancy, this clear tilt in favour of London-based Chelsea by the London-based Premier League. If Manchester-based City do reach the last 16 of Big Cup, maybe the Premier League will see the error of its ways. If they miss out, City know who to blame. And with City\xe2\x80\x99s budget for lawyers (not limited by Financial Fair Play, as far as we know), the Fiver knows who would win.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY     Dave Whelan. Photograph: Barrington Coombs/PA    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was growing up we used to call the Chinese \xe2\x80\x98chingalings\xe2\x80\x99. We weren\xe2\x80\x99t being disrespected [sic]. We used to say, \xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99re going to eat in chingalings. The Chinese weren\xe2\x80\x99t offended by that\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Dave Whelan, still digging.</p> CLUB STATEMENT OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWigan Athletic are reminding supporters that it is illegal to swear or use racist, homophobic or sexist language\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Oh.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY II <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe players get treated unbelievably well. Sometimes, farcically well. You get a 14-year-old needing a rubdown before training. I can\xe2\x80\x99t accept that. I spoke to an eight-year-old who told me he had done a hamstring. I said, \xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t believe you know what your hamstring is, son. Now go out there and get running\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Sean Dyche, not a fan of the FA\xe2\x80\x99s England DNA plans, or eight-year-olds with hamstring-twang, apparently.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel. Subscribe today! And there\xe2\x80\x99s also a new app for iOS and Android \xe2\x80\x93 details of the football offering are here.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is baffling to me that the Fiver has the audacity to claim to know the estimated answer to a problem like 925,000,000 multiplied by .000005 (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s bits and bobs) but then proceed to show a complete incapacity to count from 1 to 10 properly (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Still Want Mores). How can I ever take you seriously? Oh wait \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ahmed Aly (and, erm, 10,056 other maths pedants).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou say that there are more copies of Football Manager to be won if your letter is good enough so \xe2\x80\x98if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been lucky thus far, buck your ideas up\xe2\x80\x99 and in the next section you encourage us all to go on a date with somebody incredibly attractive and say \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s not the rejection that kills you, it\xe2\x80\x99s the hope\xe2\x80\x99. Am I the only one thinking those two taglines are the wrong way round?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Robin Hazlehurst.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI must say, since I am an inveterate moaner and complainer, that Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s Prize Letter should have been awarded to Graham Quick. It was brief and funny. Surely the clue was in his name? \xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Mike O\xe2\x80\x99Leary .</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com, and/or failing that we are also available on Twitter.

We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a dwindling number of copies to give away this month, so if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t been lucky thus far, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget it\xe2\x80\x99s not the rejection that kills you, it\xe2\x80\x99s the hope.</p> JOIN GUARDIAN SOULMATES <p>Chances are that if you\xe2\x80\x99re reading this tea-timely football email, you\xe2\x80\x99re almost certainly single.

Eidur Gudjohnsen\xe2\x80\x99s back. At Bolton.</p> <p>The thoroughly pathetic Russian FA has banned FC Rostov midfielder Gu\xc3\xa9lor Kanga for three matches for making an \xe2\x80\x9cinsulting gesture\xe2\x80\x9d at fans who were racially abusing him.</p> <p>Mansfield have appointed 33-year-old Adam Murray as manager, who becomes the youngest manager in the Football League. There\xe2\x80\x99s probably some gag about a freshy-minted Murray available here, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t find it.</p> <p>And \xe2\x80\x98Arry Redknapp will not let his QPR players have a Christmas knees-up. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve only got to be closing your eyes and someone has got a picture of you making it look like you\xe2\x80\x99re drunk.
