b'Reading\xe2\x80\x99s Adam Federici backed by Steve Clarke after gift to Arsenal'


b'<p>Steve Clarke offered his full support to Adam Federici, after the goalkeeper was left distraught by his glaring error in extra time that led to Reading\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 FA Cup semi-final defeat against Arsenal.</p> <p>The 30-year-old Australian, who has been at the club since 2005, allowed Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez\xe2\x80\x99s low shot in the 105th minute to go through his legs and over the line, to effectively kill Reading\xe2\x80\x99s hopes of a first FA Cup final in their 144-year history.</p> <p>Federici had previously made good saves and none better than on 69 minutes, when he clawed the substitute Gabriel Paulista\xe2\x80\x99s header up against the crossbar and out to safety. However, he was left in tears at the full-time whistle after his howler from Sanchez\xe2\x80\x99s effort.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the life of a goalkeeper and Adam is a top goalkeeper,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarke, the Reading manager, said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s every chance that he will be the Reading player of the season. His performances in the Championship have been absolutely crucial. We stick by him. We don\xe2\x80\x99t lose because of Adam.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody supports him. Adam is a strong character as well. He\xe2\x80\x99ll take his disappointment on the chin and on Wednesday night, when we play Birmingham at home, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be as good as he always is.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Reading striker Jamie Mackie said: \xe2\x80\x9cFederici has been our best player this season. If it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for him, we\xe2\x80\x99d be in the bottom three. We win together and we lose together.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Clarke praised a \xe2\x80\x9cnear perfect\xe2\x80\x9d performance from his team, while he highlighted a couple of dubious offside decisions, which pulled back Mackie and Pavel Pogrebnyak when they were clean through. He was upset, too, that Mathieu Debuchy was not penalised for a 66th-minute handball. \xe2\x80\x9cHis hand is out here and he stops the cross from going in,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarke said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a penalty. These are the moments that you need in a game like this.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger, who reported that Per Mertesacker had been forced off with an ankle injury that did not \xe2\x80\x9clook too good\xe2\x80\x9d, could now become the first\xc2\xa0modern-day manager to win six FA Cups.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn the end, we were a bit lucky because the keeper made a mistake and I can understand that he is distraught, but he kept them in the game for long periods,\xe2\x80\x9d Wenger said. \xe2\x80\x9cReading were ready to die on the pitch to go to this final and you have to congratulate them for the effort they put in.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Wenger said that he was unaware of Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s 1-0 win over Manchester United, which moved them closer to\xc2\xa0the Premier League title. When he\xc2\xa0was told of the result, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cAh, 1-0. Usual.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
