b'Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s transfer roundup'


b'Glen Johnson, Liverpool <p>Brendan Rodgers has intervened in Glen Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s contract stand-off with Liverpool to declare he wants to keep the England defender at Anfield. The 30-year-old is a free agent this summer and eligible to sign a pre-contract agreement with an overseas club this month having resisted Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s offer of a short-term extension on terms reduced from his \xc2\xa3120,000-a-week wage. Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s offer was made late last season but the manager wanted a longer deal and said in November that he was \xe2\x80\x9cnot going to go crawling to anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d An impasse remains but Rodgers has hinted a resolution that once appeared highly unlikely could happen, and urged Liverpool to extend the right-back\xe2\x80\x99s career at Anfield. \xe2\x80\x9cI am hopeful he will stay and hopeful that we can find a solution and keep him here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Liverpool manager. Andy Hunter</p> Lee Chung-yong \xe2\x96\xb6 Crystal Palace <p>Crystal Palace are confident of completing a deal to sign the Bolton winger Lee Chung-yong, with the clubs close to agreeing a fee for the South Korea international. Lee, who joined Bolton in 2009, is out of contract in the summer having made nearly 200 appearances for the Championship side. However, with the 26-year-old among the highest wage earners at Bolton, the club are keen to offload him and are likely to accept around \xc2\xa31.5m plus add-ons. Palace also retain an interest in the Southampton midfielder Jack Cork, who has entered the final six months of his contract. Southampton will seek to sell him if he does not intend to sign a new deal. Ed Aarons and Dominic Fifield</p> Kyle Naughton \xe2\x96\xb6 Swansea City <p>Swansea have confirmed the signing of the defender Kyle Naughton from Tottenham. The 26-year-old full-back, who can operate on the right or the left side of defence, has signed a three and a half year contract in a deal understood to be worth \xc2\xa35m and could make his debut in the FA Cup fourth-round tie at Blackburn tomorrow. Naughton made only five Premier League starts under the Tottenham manager, Mauricio Pochettino, and has not played since the end of November. PA</p> Kevin De Bruyne, Wolfsburg <p>Kevin De Bruyne\xe2\x80\x99s agent has ruled out a move for the Wolfsburg midfielder. De Bruyne, who left Chelsea last January for around \xc2\xa318m having made only six starts, has been in superb form for Wolfsburg as they have risen to second place in the Bundesliga behind Bayern Munich. That has led to rumours that clubs including Bayern, Manchester United and Arsenal are interested in signing him. His agent, Patrick De Koster, said: \xe2\x80\x9cKevin is totally focused on helping Wolfsburg to qualify for the Champions League. But after that, who knows?\xe2\x80\x9d Ed Aarons</p> Sammy Eto\xe2\x80\x99o \xe2\x96\xb6 Sampdoria <p>Sampdoria have not given up hope of signing Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o but negotiations with Everton are proving more complicated than the Italian club expected. Eto\xe2\x80\x99o is reported to have agreed an 18-month contract with the Serie A side and to be willing to reduce his wages by 40%, but the 33-year-old has yet to reach an agreement to leave Goodison Park. New York Cosmos have joined the race to sign the 33-year-old former Cameroon forward. PA</p> Callum McManaman \xe2\x96\xb6 West Brom <p>Tony Pulis has not given up on his chase for Callum McManaman. West Brom have made two bids for the Wigan winger and although the second offer has not been officially rejected it is understood it will be. The West Brom head coach is also keen on the Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher. PA</p>'
