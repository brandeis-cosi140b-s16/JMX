b'When Middlesbrough left Manchester City on dark side of the blue moon | Louise Taylor'


b'<p>The chant was inspired by Pink Floyd. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t need no Phil Scolari, we don\xe2\x80\x99t need no Mourinho; hey Thaksin, leave our Sven alone,\xe2\x80\x9d chorused the Manchester City supporters to the tune of Another Brick in the Wall.</p> <p>Beneath a bright Teesside sun the Riverside Stadium\xe2\x80\x99s away end were urging Thaksin Shinawatra, City\xe2\x80\x99s Thai owner, not to sack Sven-Goran Eriksson.</p> <p>As football protest songs go it can rarely have been bettered but 11 May 2008 was not City\xe2\x80\x99s day. Lacking even a semblance of their fans\xe2\x80\x99 defiance, they concluded the season by surrendering 8-1 to Gareth Southgate\xe2\x80\x99s Middlesbrough. </p> <p>Almost seven years on, and having taken somewhat divergent paths, the teams reconvene in FA Cup fourth round combat at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday. Remarkably, Joe Hart, an unused substitute during what was to prove Eriksson\xe2\x80\x99s final game in charge before his replacement by Mark Hughes, is the only player involved in 2008 still at either club.</p> <p>Driven by globalisation, the pace of change has been so radical and so rapid that, in many ways, the whole extraordinary match almost feels part of a much earlier era. Although a few of the principal players remain household names, others are earning livings in the Middle East and Asia while several are no longer professional footballers.</p> <p>City began unravelling when Richard Dunne was sent off for fouling Tuncay and Stewart Downing converted the resulting penalty. Suitably encouraged, Afonso Alves began teasing those Teessiders who had dismissed him as a \xc2\xa312m Brazilian misfit by shooting the first goal of a technically accomplished hat-trick.</p> <p>Downing\xe2\x80\x99s sublime volley dispatched with the outside of his left boot boosted the scoreline, Alves registered a second and, courtesy of a deflection, the substitute Adam Johnson got in on the scoring act.</p> <p>F\xc3\xa1bio Rochemback\xe2\x80\x99s vicious, high-velocity, free-kick preceded J\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9mie Aliadi\xc3\xa8re\xe2\x80\x99s low shot and, after Elano claimed City\xe2\x80\x99s consolation, Alves completed that treble. It revived memories of the previous month when Boro\xe2\x80\x99s record buy had deconstructed Rio Ferdinand while scoring twice against Manchester United but such cameos were to prove cruel chimeras.</p>  <p> Related: FA Cup fourth round: 10 things to look out for this weekend </p>   <p>Alves, recruited from Heerenveen, would score only four league goals as Boro were relegated the following season. With his wages a millstone, the striker moved onto Qatar where he represented a handful of clubs before dropping out of the game in 2013.</p> <p>Another Brazilian, Elano, had been the early star of a season which, bolstered by Eriksson\xe2\x80\x99s appointment and the acquisition of overseas imports (many sourced by Graham Carr, now Newcastle United\xe2\x80\x99s chief scout), promised a top-five City finish. A collision with a mid-winter wall saw them limp to the Riverside en route to finishing ninth. Even so, the dramatic capitulation to a team four places below them suggested they had already adopted the languor demanded by the 40C temperatures awaiting on assorted holidays in Dubai and Las Vegas the following week.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you lose like this it\xe2\x80\x99s awful,\xe2\x80\x9d Eriksson said. \xe2\x80\x9cMentally we had nothing left. We were not even on the pitch \xe2\x80\x93 the team had totally gone. It was embarrassing for everyone. I\xe2\x80\x99m living in the unsecure and it\xe2\x80\x99s not very nice.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Greater embarrassment was to come later that summer when Garry Cook, City\xe2\x80\x99s then chief executive, described Shinawatra \xe2\x80\x93 a former Thai prime minister with a less than impeccable human rights record \xe2\x80\x93 as \xe2\x80\x9ca great guy to play golf with\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Coincidentally, Steve Gibson also had golf on his mind. Boro\xe2\x80\x99s rather more gentlemanly owner was helping preside over the construction of one of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s longest courses in attractively undulating parkland adjacent to the club\xe2\x80\x99s training ground south of Darlington. Alongside it, a \xc2\xa360m investment was turning Rockliffe Hall, a 19th-century mansion house, into one of the UK\xe2\x80\x99s finest five-star hotels and, potentially, a guarantor of Boro\xe2\x80\x99s future prosperity.</p> <p>Ranked second in TripAdvisor\xe2\x80\x99s 2012 list of UK luxury hotels, it represents one of Gibson\xe2\x80\x99s proudest achievements. \xe2\x80\x9cRockliffe Hall is fantastic, a gem to this area,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s special. We believe it will eventually create an income equal to our gate revenue. Middlesbrough FC represents a town of only 120,000-125,000 people so we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to punch above our weight.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Seven years ago this task was complicated by the international credit crunch which forced Gibson \xe2\x80\x93 who, over the years, has poured more than \xc2\xa3100m into Boro \xe2\x80\x93 to find new ways of restructuring the club\xe2\x80\x99s then \xc2\xa385m debt.</p> <p>That sum has since been eliminated but, with Rockliffe Hall gobbling cash, Southgate confronted austerity. The most expensive squad in Boro\xe2\x80\x99s history was swiftly dismantled with the manager trimming \xc2\xa37m from the wage bill before relegation was confirmed in May 2009.</p> <p>One hundred and 12 miles south-west across the Pennines, the horizon looked appreciably brighter. Eight months earlier Sheikh Mansour and his Abu Dhabi United Group had bought City. No matter that their first vanity signing, Robinho, would prove virtually as ineffective as Southgate\xe2\x80\x99s purchases of Alves and Mido, Mansour was writing off City\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa3305m debt while spending countless millions more in pursuit of two titles secured by Roberto Mancini and Manuel Pellegrini.</p> <p>With the appointments of the soon-to-be-sacked Southgate\xe2\x80\x99s successors, Gordon Strachan and Tony Mowbray, lacking similar impact, Boro seemed consigned to Championship anonymity but Gibson was quietly forging strong links with Jorge Mendes, the international football agent and Peter Kenyon, the former Manchester United and Chelsea chief executive.</p> <p>Formulating a new blueprint based broadly around Moneyball principles he began establishing relationships with assorted European clubs including Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid, Juventus and Chelsea involving scope for future loan arrangements.</p> <p>Most importantly, Aitor Karanka replaced Mowbray. Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s former assistant at Real Madrid will most definitely not be underestimated by Pellegrini. It is no fluke that Boro\xe2\x80\x99s well-coached team of homegrown products, bargain overseas imports and smart loan acquisitions, travel to the Etihad sitting second in the Championship. \xe2\x80\x9cAppointing Aitor was a real change for us,\xe2\x80\x9d Gibson says. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the past I\xe2\x80\x99ve been accused of being a little Englander but football\xe2\x80\x99s global now \xe2\x80\x93 we\xe2\x80\x99re all one.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Along the way Adam Clayton\xe2\x80\x99s world has been turned upside down. In May 2008 a midfielder expected to start for Karanka\xe2\x80\x99s side on Saturday afternoon was ending his first year as a young professional at City.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI grew up in a house 10 minutes from Maine Road,\xe2\x80\x9d Clayton says. \xe2\x80\x9cI was seven when I joined City\xe2\x80\x99s Academy and I watched the first team every week. I went eight or nine years without missing a single home game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He was there when City dropped into English football\xe2\x80\x99s third tier and, at one point, counted five managers coming and going in bewilderingly swift succession. \xe2\x80\x9cCity\xe2\x80\x99s a completely different club to the one I joined as a kid,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cNow there\xe2\x80\x99s no one there I know player-wise except Joe Hart.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99m really looking forward to going back. I\xe2\x80\x99ve played at the Etihad loads of times for the reserves but being involved in a top-class game will be special for me as a City fan and for Boro as a club. We want to prove ourselves against the best.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Where are they now? Manchester City <p>1 Andreas Isaksson \xe2\x80\x93 now 33.
