b'West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s Carlton Cole: since I was 28, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about the future'


b'<p>It is probably just as well Carlton Cole has learned to focus on the bigger picture. Otherwise, the West Ham United striker might well still be stewing over the call from Sam Allardyce at around 10.40pm on transfer deadline day, dragging him away from Tony Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s sales pitch, which delivered confirmation the plug had been pulled on a move to West Bromwich Albion. With the trill of a mobile phone, the forward was effectively denied a fresh start, some longer-term security and, in all probability, proper first-team involvement.</p> <p>These days, even with frustration still simmering at life on the periphery at Upton Park, Cole has learned to shrug and offer up a smile when talk turns to that aborted \xc2\xa3500,000 move to The Hawthorns. \xe2\x80\x9cI had a chance to play football, to feature regularly, and then the manager chose not to let me go 20 minutes before the deadline,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was sitting there at the table with the pen in my hand, asking: \xe2\x80\x98Where do I sign?\xe2\x80\x99 Then the phone rings and he tells me he can\xe2\x80\x99t let me go because he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got a replacement in. I ended up effing and blinding in one of the catering rooms. Then it was a case of, OK, time to go home. See you later, Tony.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s fine. I can\xe2\x80\x99t be bothered complaining any more. Sam will tell you that\xe2\x80\x99s why he likes me, because I just get on with my job. He said he needed me but if I\xe2\x80\x99m honest I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he has. I must have played 120 minutes of football since but sometimes you don\xe2\x80\x99t get what you want. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get what I wanted. Now I have to do the right thing by me and my family and try to earn another deal.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He has actually managed one start and 168 minutes of Premier League football in the 10 weeks since, as well as 22 minutes back at West Brom in the FA Cup, but the point still stands. His contract expires in June and unless the run-in suddenly yields a flurry of opportunities and goals, he is into the endgame at the Boleyn Ground.</p> <p>Such uncertainty might have reduced others to introspection, or bitterness that West Ham could not prise Emmanuel Adebayor from Tottenham Hotspur to permit him his move and thoughts focusing instead on where next for his own career. Yet Cole has other distractions.</p> <p>The 31-year-old spent Sunday evening hosting a charity auction at a plush Knightsbridge venue to raise funds for Football Fighting Ebola. Cole\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Selina, is from Sierra Leone, a country devastated by the virus which has cost tens of thousands of lives, left a generation of children orphaned and destroyed entire communities. Monies generated by the initiative, which has the England full-back Nathaniel Clyne as another of its ambassadors, will support the King\xe2\x80\x99s Sierra Leone Partnership and ensure the crisis in west Africa is not forgotten.</p> <p>Stewing over his next multimillion-pound playing contract would have seemed somewhat inappropriate given Cole\xe2\x80\x99s uncle is back in Sierra Leone \xe2\x80\x9ccaught up in it all\xe2\x80\x9d and unable to leave as the country deals with the epidemic.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe says he can\xe2\x80\x99t come back because there are no planes flying out at the moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said the player. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s going through it all but he\xe2\x80\x99s OK, he\xe2\x80\x99s all right. Many other people are not. There are all these mixed signals at the moment as to how they are all coping. First they say the numbers [infected] are up, then they\xe2\x80\x99re down, but no one really knows. Back here, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy for the general public to forget about what is going on. To start thinking: \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s only Ebola.\xe2\x80\x99 They have to realise people are suffering over there still. This is about creating awareness, keeping it in the news. The hope is we can eradicate the disease. That is why we are here raising funds.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not just about right now, either. It\xe2\x80\x99s about the future for Sierra Leone, too. To help get the country back on its feet and try to move on. My mother and I already have a foundation, Carlakka, which is helping to build a school. But there are so many kids who have been left without parents, so now we\xe2\x80\x99re going to try to build an orphanage.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Cole hopes to visit in November for what would be his first return to his mother\xe2\x80\x99s homeland in three years \xe2\x80\x93 he used to travel there regularly \xe2\x80\x93 but he has already met the president, Ernest Bai Koroma, and has potential future involvement mapped out. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s taken to me so hopefully I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be in the running for office\xc2\xa0...\xe2\x80\x9d offered the striker before creasing up in laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, seriously, I do want to get into government and they have asked me to become a sports ambassador.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody in football is privileged because they are seen all over the world, which gives us a platform to help. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always had this head on me. I have always wanted to make a difference. That\xe2\x80\x99s either in you or it\xe2\x80\x99s not \xe2\x80\x93 you can\xe2\x80\x99t force it \xe2\x80\x93 and that\xe2\x80\x99s my attitude to life. It is my mum\xe2\x80\x99s country, and therefore my family\xe2\x80\x99s country. So one day I will start doing more stuff over there. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not to think about just now. That one\xe2\x80\x99s for the future.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Cole finds himself at his own crossroads. A player who made his debut for Chelsea 13 years ago this month, scoring on his second senior appearance in a win at Middlesbrough, will privately expect to depart West Ham after nine seasons \xe2\x80\x93 there have been 257 appearances and 59 goals in all competitions \xe2\x80\x93 and prolong his career elsewhere. West Brom may revive their interest in the summer, though whether they will be willing to offer the same deal through to 2017 that was on the table in February remains to be seen. The striker has mentioned China or the United States as possible destinations.</p> <p>For all that his impact has been minimal at Upton Park since the window closed, despite the injuries suffered by Andy Carroll and Enner Valencia, there will be opportunities in the weeks that remain given Diafra Sakho may not play again this term and Valencia is back in the treatment room with a foot injury. \xe2\x80\x9cI just want to get as much game-time as I can at the moment, from now until the end of the season,\xe2\x80\x9d Cole said. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel I do have a lot to offer any team who takes me on, and experience as well given I have been playing in the Premier League for over 10 years. I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to have a presence in the team, as hard as that\xe2\x80\x99s been this year. I do feel I could have played a bigger part in the last 12 or 13 games, but the manager chose to go with someone else.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The team\xe2\x80\x99s form has tailed off in that period, with two wins in 15 games stretching back before Christmas when Allardyce\xe2\x80\x99s side had retained faint hopes of Champions League qualification. It has been suggested the uncertainty that exists around the manager\xe2\x80\x99s own contractual situation \xe2\x80\x93 his deal also expires in the summer \xe2\x80\x93 has proved unsettling. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think Sam knows what he is doing, so he ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to be talking about my contract, is he?\xe2\x80\x9d offered the forward. \xe2\x80\x9cYou hear general chitchat but we don\xe2\x80\x99t sit there talking about things like the manager\xe2\x80\x99s future. In football you just don\xe2\x80\x99t know what will happen from one year to the next. It can be fine and dandy one season, and then you have a stinker the next. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether Sam will be there or not.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSo you accept that is how the game is and you try to plan ahead in other ways. I\xe2\x80\x99m only 31, even if I\xe2\x80\x99m playing like I\xe2\x80\x99ve retired\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 No, really, since I was about 28, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about the future. Trying to put money away, not buying all those flash cars I used to, just trying to be sensible. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to get sucked in, wasting a lot of money and not going about your career the right way. That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so refreshing to see someone like Nathaniel, at the age of 24, involved in a project like this. I commend him on that. You just need to develop. And this is part of my development.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>To donate to Football Fighting Ebola visit virginmoneygiving.com/FootballFightingEbola or text \xe2\x80\x98STOPEBOLA\xe2\x80\x99 to 70030 which automatically gives \xc2\xa310</p>'
