b'Louis van Gaal not happy until Manchester United play the perfect game'


b'<p>If Louis van Gaal has steadied the Manchester United ship in his first six months at Old Trafford, then consistency at home has been key to climbing back into the top four of the Premier League. This time last year United had lost four times at Old Trafford. This season they have suffered one defeat, by Swansea on the opening day, and 25 points from a possible 30 at home compares favourably with 12 collected on the road from the same number of games.</p> <p>Factor in the consideration that Van Gaal has rarely been able to field a settled side, let alone work out his best one, because of all the injuries United have had to deal with since his arrival, and the coach ought to be satisfied with entering the new year in third place.</p> <p>Van Gaal, though, does not consider himself the sort of coach big clubs hire just to be satisfied. \xe2\x80\x9cI want more as a manager,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI always want the perfect game and we haven\xe2\x80\x99t played it yet. I expect more attacking quality from Manchester United. Not because they are Manchester United and have a tradition for it but because I have. I am the coach and that is the type of football I like to see. I always expect more attacking quality from the teams I coach and Manchester United will improve, you shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>This is not a coded message to the club\xe2\x80\x99s owners to reach for their chequebooks while the transfer window is open. United have just signed Victor Vald\xc3\xa9s as backup to David de Gea \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we identify a target we can move very quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d Van Gaal said \xe2\x80\x93 but the manager has no intention of being rushed into spending money.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI only want to buy players who are better quality than the ones I already have,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf a player is available who will improve our squad, then we will buy. I do not have to wait until summer but, if I cannot find anyone to improve my selection, I will wait, maybe for another year if necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>That seems to rule out any January moves for attacking players. United could still use a reliable centre-half, although the return of Daley Blind and Marcos Rojo gives them more options in defence, but in terms of creative players Van Gaal already has more than he can easily field in the same team. With \xc3\x81ngel di Mar\xc3\xada available again, Juan Mata may have to miss out, despite showing his best form since arriving from Chelsea. Radamel Falcao is only on loan, so for the money involved it makes sense to use him as often as possible, while Wayne Rooney is captain and therefore an automatic selection, even if Van Gaal did recently hint he might occasionally leave him out in the interests of balance.</p> <p>While Van Gaal refused to confirm or deny speculation that Robin van Persie may be due for a rest against Southampton, he did accept that it would not be possible to accommodate all five of his frontline creative players in the same side.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFour players who are mostly creative is the most you can use,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe use four and that is a lot but I always want the best lineup so I have to select. I do not believe in rotation. You can rest a player if he is tired or injured but that is different. My job is to choose the best possible team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>United\xe2\x80\x99s win at St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s last month was one of only two away victories this season, surprising in view of Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s overall form, though at the time Ronald Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s side were experiencing a minor dip and most observers agreed the visitors were lucky to escape with all three points.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not our best game, Southampton made it very difficult for us,\xe2\x80\x9d Van Gaal said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I think we have improved since. We are at home this time, and we have almost every player back from injury. I do think Southampton are a good side, though, and it would not surprise me if they finished in the top four this season. When you look at the quality of their players and their coaching staff there is no reason why they should not stay in the top four. I know they have not qualified for the Champions League before but this season they have the chance and I think they might take it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
