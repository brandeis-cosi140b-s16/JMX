b'Confident England are targeting World Cup glory in Canada'


b'<p>Mark Sampson is confident England can win the Women\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup after selecting his 23-player squad for the tournament, naming a blend of experience and youth that he believes can go far in Canada having qualified unbeaten.</p> <p>Katie Chapman has been included and could play in her first tournament since 2009, with England attempting to improve on their quarter-final performance at Germany 2011 and a subsequent dismal campaign at the European Championship in Sweden two years ago.</p> <p>This will be Sampson\xe2\x80\x99s first major competition in charge of England, having been appointed following Hope Powell\xe2\x80\x99s departure. His side\xe2\x80\x99s opening match on 9 June against France \xe2\x80\x93 ranked third in the world behind USA and Germany \xe2\x80\x93 will arguably be the sternest test of a group also including Colombia and Mexico, with this year\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup expanded from 16 teams to 24.</p> <p>Asked if England could win the tournament, Sampson said: \xe2\x80\x9cWithout a shadow of a doubt. This is a team that on their day can beat anyone. You look at the record; 18 months and three defeats, the team is in a good place.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey are confident, they feel they can play well and represent themselves in the right way. I know we\xe2\x80\x99ve got players that on their day can beat anyone but we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to make sure our performance levels are right and our mentality is right. If we\xe2\x80\x99ve got any ambition of winning it, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be in fifth gear and foot to the floor in every single game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Steph Houghton will captain the side, in a squad that includes eight World Cup debutants. Casey Stoney, Jo Potter and Fran Kirby all made the cut, while the Liverpool forward Natasha Dowie missed out along with Demi Stokes, Jess Clarke and Anita Asante.</p> <p>England\xe2\x80\x99s qualification was certainly impressive, scoring 52 goals and conceding one in 10 matches. However, despite breezing through their group, they were comfortably beaten 3-0 by Germany at Wembley last November and then lost 1-0 to USA in February.</p> <p>Both USA and Germany, as well as France, are expected to challenge for the title this summer while England are sixth in the Fifa rankings. A number of players are going into the tournament having only recently recovered from injury but Sampson believes all will be available for selection before the France match.</p> <p>Houghton, who has been carrying a knee problem, believes the experience in the current squad ensures England are better equipped for a major tournament than in the past. Asked if it was the best national side she had played in, Houghton said: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I think so. 2011 was a very good squad. Now I look at this squad and there is a lot more experience of major tournaments.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe reached the quarter-finals of the previous World Cup and I think we\xe2\x80\x99d always want to do one better than that. Mark is right: we have to be aiming to win the tournament but we have to be realistic as well. It depends how we start and who we potentially face.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a really good mix of experience and youngsters who are going to a World Cup for the first time. It has pretty much been the same squad over the past 10-11 months and hopefully we can blend even more than we have done.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got players who can win a match with a lot of flair and a lot of speed and we\xe2\x80\x99ve also got players who know the game inside out, who can be clever and maybe shut out the game. We have to be at our best. We have to be playing near-perfect football to go and win a World Cup.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>England will train at St George\xe2\x80\x99s Park before flying out to Canada on 25 May, with the squad set to practise on artificial pitches beforehand. An international group of players had filed a legal complaint against Fifa about the use of such surfaces during the tournament but dropped the case earlier this year.</p> <p>This World Cup \xe2\x80\x93 the seventh since the inaugural competition in 1991 \xe2\x80\x93 will again receive significant airtime from the BBC, which will broadcast 22 matches live on network TV as well as showing each game across various platforms.</p> <p>Barbara Slater, the director of BBC Sport, said there was a \xe2\x80\x9ctremendous sense of momentum\xe2\x80\x9d within the women\xe2\x80\x99s game but Sampson insisted the increased exposure did not add pressure.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s great that there is such interest in this tournament. It\xe2\x80\x99s the biggest women\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup in history,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sampson. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the players\xe2\x80\x99 point of view, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got enough to worry about with the World Cup. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s one person watching, or 100 journalists here or not one, the players\xc2\xa0are fully focused on performing at the best level they can. They\xe2\x80\x99d love to inspire a nation but their focus is on performance.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Full squad <p>Goalkeepers: Siobhan Chamberlain (Arsenal); Karen Bardsley (Man City), Carly Telford (Notts County)</p> <p>Defenders: Lucy Bronze, Steph Houghton (Man City), Alex Scott (Arsenal), Laura Bassett, Alex Greenwood (Notts County), Claire Rafferty (Chelsea), Casey Stoney (Arsenal)</p> <p>Midfield: Jordan Nobbs (Arsenal), Fara Williams (Liverpool), Jill Scott (Man City), Jade Moore, Karen Carney, Jo Potter (Birmingham), Katie Chapman (Chelsea)</p> <p>Forwards: Toni Duggan (Man City), Eni Aluko (Chelsea), Lianne Sanderson (Arsenal), Jodie Taylor (Portland Thorns), Fran Kirby (Reading), Ellen White (Notts County)</p>'
