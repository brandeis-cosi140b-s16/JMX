b'<p>Danny Welbeck may have 227 goals to go to catch up with Thierry Henry but Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger is willing to accept there are potential parallels between his new centre-forward and the club\xe2\x80\x99s record scorer.</p> <p>The England striker opened his account for Arsenal as Aston Villa were swept aside with a three-goal burst inside 200 first-half seconds and the Arsenal manager said wryly that he had nothing against the notion of Welbeck following in Henry\xe2\x80\x99s footsteps.</p> <p>Like Henry, whom Wenger signed as a diffident winger from Juventus in his early twenties in 1999, Welbeck has arrived at Arsenal after doing more running than scoring at Manchester United with the invitation to develop in a more favoured central attacking role.</p> <p>For Welbeck to build the kind of reputation that the former France captain established in eight swashbuckling, trophy-winning years in north London might take something of a leap of faith but everyone has to start somewhere. And Welbeck is an athlete of no little technique or appetite who is well suited to Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s ever-revolving attacking game.</p> <p>Wenger was instrumental in bringing Henry out of his shell as his compatriot became the club\xe2\x80\x99s talisman in an era when they won five major trophies. Now he wants to see how much va va voom his new \xc2\xa316m forward can bring to Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s game.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLook, give me some time,\xe2\x80\x9d Wenger said, smiling, when asked whether he could nurture Welbeck as he did Henry. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a bit early to say that when you look at the number of goals Thierry Henry scored.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think [Welbeck] has an interesting potential and let\xe2\x80\x99s see how he develops. He has a good mentality, good physical potential, good technical potential, he contributes to our team play because he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lose the ball up front and those are important qualities. [Henry] is a good act to follow, you know \xe2\x80\xa6 I have nothing against it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Wenger put Welbeck\xe2\x80\x99s several misses in the Champions League humbling by Borussia Dortmund down to \xe2\x80\x9ca nervous problem\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9che rushed a bit his finishing\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a good finisher. I think as well he has played at Manchester United in the position wide for the last two or three years, never through the middle. Then you lose a little bit of that instinct to score \xe2\x80\xa6 which is a little animalistic. You need to always be in the middle and wait for your chance to kill the opponent. On the flank you have less of that responsibility.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Welbeck also helped Wenger justify his faith in retaining Mesut \xc3\x96zil by playing the pass from which the German schemer scampered through to open the scoring after 32 minutes. That followed a confident start by Villa during which a header by Ciaran Clark had required a superb save from Wojciech Szczesny to keep it out.</p> <p>Then \xc3\x96zil, capitalising on the privilege of playing the No10 role against a weaker side, returned the favour 80 seconds later by crossing for Welbeck to score in much the same manner as he did for England in their 2-0 win against Switzerland a fortnight ago. When Aly Cissoko diverted Kieran Gibbs\xe2\x80\x99s cross-shot into his own net in the 36th minute, Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccrisis\xe2\x80\x9d in failing to beat Manchester City and losing to Dortmund was forgotten and the bottom had fallen out of Villa\xe2\x80\x99s best start to a season in 16 years.</p> <p>At least six Villa players were afflicted by a virus that has obliged Paul Lambert, the manager, to shut the training ground. Ashley Westwood dropped out five minutes before kick-off \xe2\x80\x93 offering Carlos S\xc3\xa1nchez, the Colombian anchorman, a full debut he will want to forget as \xc3\x96zil was granted all the freedom he craves \xe2\x80\x93 and Andreas Weimann at half-time.</p> <p>The capitulation rather burst the feelgood bubble around Villa Park that had enticed Randy Lerner, the chairman, to make a rare visit from the US. But Lambert, fresh from his contract extension, still has the satisfaction of 10 points in the bag from five games before his team encounter Chelsea and Manchester City, and with Christian Benteke, their totemic goalscorer, closing in on a return after six months out with a ruptured achilles, there is cause for cautious optimism.</p> <p>But this was Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s day, aided by their reversion to 4-2-3-1, and one to bolster the confidence in particular of their two goalscorers. Welbeck offered a perspective on \xc3\x96zil\xe2\x80\x99s contribution. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not just Mesut but everyone involved in Arsenal who knows how to play football,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad to get the goal today but if you look at all strikers they miss chances. The most important thing is to get over it and move on to the next opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Man of the match: Mesut \xc3\x96zil (Arsenal)</p>'
