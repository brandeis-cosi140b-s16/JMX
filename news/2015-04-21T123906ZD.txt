b'David Moyes at Manchester United, one year on: was it as bad as we thought?'


b'<p>The David Moyes mantra since being sacked as Manchester United manager 12 months on Wednesday is that he was not allowed time to succeed. The Scot maintains any chance to discover if he could do the job was thwarted when Ed Woodward, the executive vice\xe2\x80\x91chairman, tore up his six-year contract on 22 April of last season, 10 months into his tenure.</p> <p>Yet in doing so Woodward \xe2\x80\x93 and the Glazers \xe2\x80\x93 were effectively saying to Moyes\xe2\x80\x99s plea for more time: \xe2\x80\x9cHow soon is now?\xe2\x80\x9d The prescient answer might actually have come two months earlier. Because, by the time the trigger was finally pulled, Moyes\xe2\x80\x99s United were in seventh place on 57 points from 34 games, 13 points from a Champions League berth.</p> <p>The harsh truth is that the alarm bells had been clanging since a dismal spring night in Athens. On 25 February, Moyes\xe2\x80\x99s side lost a Champions League last-16 opening leg 2-0 to Olympiakos in what was the poorest display from a United side of recent memory. This was the moment Moyes was terminally damaged in the eyes of the board.</p>  <p> Related: Manchester United in pole position to sign Memphis Depay from PSV </p>   <p>The cold analysis is that in transfer strategy, media relations, man\xe2\x80\x91management, playing style and, of course, results, Moyes was not quite good enough. This is no shame, especially as the Scot was following a phenomenon called Sir Alex Ferguson and his 26 success-soaked years.</p> <p>The 11 seasons at Everton and the current rebuild of his career at Real Sociedad indicate Moyes is not a bad manager. The Scot also convinced Wayne Rooney he could be content again at United: a legacy all fans can be grateful for. Yet from the outset it always appeared close to an impossible task to replace Ferguson \xe2\x80\x93 something Moyes later acknowledged.</p> <p>The Scot\xe2\x80\x99s challenge was also made greater once David Gill, the highly experienced chief executive, decided to step away ahead of Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s own retirement. Gill was replaced by Woodward, who is a supreme businessman but who was then a novice in the area that impacts any manager\xe2\x80\x99s hopes: the transfer market.</p> <p>The summer of 2013 duly proved a farcical window. For differing reasons Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas, Thiago Alc\xc3\xa2ntara, Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo, Leighton Baines, Luka Modric and Ander Herrera all failed to arrive. By 1 September, Moyes had added only Marouane Fellaini for \xc2\xa327.5m, which was \xc2\xa34.5m more than his buyout clause.</p> <p>This was embarrassing for Woodward, as the chief dealmaker, but more for Moyes. As the man just departed from Everton for United he knew the precise terms of Fellaini\xe2\x80\x99s contract and could be expected to use this information to leverage the best deal.</p> <p>Moyes also did nothing to help himself by complaining about United\xe2\x80\x99s opening five league fixtures. These were Swansea City (away), Chelsea (home), Liverpool (away), Crystal Palace (away), and Manchester City (away). The new manager made the odd claim that the old manager (Ferguson) had \xe2\x80\x9ctold me those sort of things happened. I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s not because Manchester United won the league quite comfortably last year [that] the fixtures have been made much more difficult\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>If this was a supposed rallying cry to his new squad, an attempt at the us-and-them siege mentality Ferguson harnessed so well, it failed. Moyes might have mentioned the next league outing during this moan, too. Because after West Bromwich Albion departed Old Trafford on 28 September only seven points had been claimed from the first six games and United were in 12th place. The Baggies had recorded a first victory at the stadium since 1978, and Moyes was already fielding questions about why last season\xe2\x80\x99s champions were struggling. Moyes\xe2\x80\x99s puzzling decisions continued in his deployment of Fellaini. In the 4-1 hiding handed to United in the derby at the Etihad Stadium six days before he was a holding midfielder, alongside Michael Carrick. Fellaini is a nightmare for opposing teams when played as an attacking midfielder. But a pattern of fielding the Belgian out of position was established. Again, as his manager for five years at Goodison Park, Moyes should have known how best to use Fellaini.</p> <p>A similar charge of buying Juan Mata \xe2\x80\x93 in the January window \xe2\x80\x93 and being unable to exploit the Spaniard\xe2\x80\x99s rich talent can be levelled. Despite the fee of \xc2\xa337.1m, then a club record, the playmaker became peripheral almost instantly under his new manager.</p> <p>The contrasting fortunes of Mata and Fellaini this season under Louis van Gaal illustrate that Moyes was correct to bring them to Old Trafford but not the right manager for either. Under the Dutchman, Mata is again the classy operator with an eye for goal, and Fellaini the terroriser of defences.</p> <p>Downward was the underlying trajectory of the Moyes\xe2\x80\x99s campaign. The sense was of a gradual slide. He enjoyed two \xe2\x80\x9cpurple patches\xe2\x80\x9d. From 23 October to 1 December, United were unbeaten in 12 matches. Four of seven league games were won, two of four Champions League matches were drawn, and there was a League Cup victory. The team ended this run in eighth position, on 22 points \xe2\x80\x93 after 13 matches \xe2\x80\x93two behind fourth-placed Liverpool.</p>     David Moyes watches his Real Sociedad side in action against Elche on Monday night. Photograph: Morell/EPA    <p>Next, though, came the step backwards that stained the season. Consecutive 1-0 defeats, to Everton, before jubilant Toffees fans inside Old Trafford, and at Newcastle United. Boom now followed bust again. The next six outings were all victories: Shaktar Donestk (at home, 1-0), Aston Villa (3-0, away), Stoke City (away in the League Cup, 2-0), West Ham United (home, 3-1), Hull City (away, 3-2), and Norwich City (away, 1-0). These results ensured United were in the last 16 of the Champions League and the League Cup semi-finals. And having been ninth on the morning of the trip to Villa, when United left Carrow Road on 28 December they had risen to sixth place, again two points from fourth.</p> <p>This was as good as it got.</p> <p>Away from the field the wheels had already began to loosen. Danny Welbeck became disillusioned before Christmas when Moyes claimed to have told the striker: \xe2\x80\x9cYou need to be out there every day finishing, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s 15 minutes at the end.\xe2\x80\x9d This was on the eve of the League Cup win over Stoke. Afterwards Welbeck said: \xe2\x80\x9cI have been doing that ever since I have been at United.\xe2\x80\x9d By early January senior players were also questioning Moyes\xe2\x80\x99s credentials and the Scot had effectively become a dead man walking.</p> <p>By the time Moyes was removed in April, four matches were left and any prospect of the Champions League qualification \xe2\x80\x93 that would save his position \xe2\x80\x93 had been over for a month or so. At the weekend Moyes discussed his role in the transformation of Rooney \xe2\x80\x93 the Liverpudlian is the captain and the club totem once more. Yet there is another gift he gave United and for which all supporters can be thankful. Moyes had the courage to be the man who followed the man.</p> <p>Even Van Gaal may have stumbled if he had stepped into Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s shoes.</p>'
