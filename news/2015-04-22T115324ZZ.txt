b'Zinedine Zidane launches Real Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s charm offensive on Eden Hazard'


b'<p>Zinedine Zidane, the Real Madrid legend, appeared to launch the club\xe2\x80\x99s bid to sign Eden Hazard from Chelsea this summer when the former France midfielder claimed he \xe2\x80\x9clikes\xe2\x80\x9d the Belgium forward more than either Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.</p> <p>Hazard scored the only goal in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s victory over Manchester United to move Chelsea within striking distance of a first Premier League title since 2010. Zidane, who is currently in charge of Real\xe2\x80\x99s Castilla B team, admitted that the player signed from Lille in 2012 for around \xc2\xa332m has caught his eye.</p> <p>Speaking to Fifa.com after Monday night\xe2\x80\x99s Match Against Poverty in Saint-Etienne, Zidane was asked if there was a player in the game today with the ability to make him dream.</p>  <p> Related: Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Eden Hazard not the standout Player of the Year of recent seasons </p>   <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNo. That\xe2\x80\x99s not the right word. There are players I keep an eye on and who I like a lot, like Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, of course. They\xe2\x80\x99re fantastic players, but I like Eden Hazard a lot too,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI enjoy everything he does on the pitch. I like the way he carries himself, that decisive streak in him and the fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s improving every year. He can still get better too, and I think he\xe2\x80\x99s a big reason why Chelsea are on top of the table.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Blues have already secured the 24-year-old on a new five-and-a-half year contract, which was signed in February, but will still be concerned about Zidane\xe2\x80\x99s comments given that Real adopted similar tactics in 2013 during their pursuit of Gareth Bale. Hazard is expected to be named both PFA player of the year and young player of the year on Sunday, having scored 13 Premier League goals this season.</p>'
