b'Manuel Pellegrini admits Manchester City must tighten up defensively'


b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini smiled at Robin van Persie\xe2\x80\x99s late equaliser for Manchester United against Chelsea.</p> <p>Chelsea appeared set to stretch their advantage over the champions to eight points before the Dutchman\xe2\x80\x99s late intervention at Old Trafford on Sunday.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t remember,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pellegrini initially when asked if he laughed at the strike. \xe2\x80\x9cAt that moment, I thought the game was finished and I went to drink a glass of water.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet pushed, he admitted: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen they told me after how the game finished I smiled.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Last Tuesday City allowed a two-goal lead at CSKA Moscow to slip as they drew 2-2 in a vital Champions League game, before going down 2-1 at West Ham United on Saturday.</p> <p>In each match City\xe2\x80\x99s defence was vulnerable, as it has been on other occasions this term. Pellegrini has been doing extra work on the rearguard. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to have clean sheets,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a team you play easily or you play with more trust when you don\xe2\x80\x99t concede any easy goal at the beginning. Then you start playing against the result, against the time, against the other team. A lot of things.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut I think we must improve in general, not just the talking about the defending. We must create more chances, we must score more goals. We are working on that and I am absolutely sure we will return to be the same team we were in the most important part of last season. But the only way is to compare last season with this season. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we are any worse this season.\xe2\x80\x9d Vincent Kompany has had to adjust at times to Eliaquim Mangala being his partner in central defence instead of Mart\xc3\xadn Demichelis. Yet Pellegrini denied this was a factor in the unsure defence.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe same happened with Demichelis last year \xe2\x80\x93 remember all the criticism for him after he just arrived in the Premier League,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cVincent was playing sometime with Mart\xc3\xadn, sometimes with Joleon Lescott, sometimes with Matija Nastasic.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think Eliaquim Mangala is a young player, he has a lot of experience. And I am sure we bought the centre-back that we need in him. This year with him, with Vincent, Martin, Nastasic and Dedryck Boyata we have a centre-backs that I can assure you will play very well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Wayne Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s fitness is in the balance for Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 168th Mancunian derby at the Etihad Stadium, though Pellegrini denied City would make any particular plans for United\xe2\x80\x99s captain should he play.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNo. We really don\xe2\x80\x99t change our way to play for some player, or other player. If it\xe2\x80\x99s not Wayne Rooney it will be \xc3\x81ngel di Mar\xc3\xada, Juan Mata or Robin van Persie,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have so many creative players that they have a lot of different chances [to score]. We cannot prepare for a game talking about one player. Because after it can happen that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t play and we have to change all of what we do. We really try to have a style of play every game. I am sure Wayne Rooney is one of the important players of Manchester United but I repeat, also other players are very difficult for us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>After Newcastle United\xe2\x80\x99s visit on Wednesday evening in the Capital One Cup, and United at the weekend, CSKA arrive for the return Champions League match. Pellegrini admits these are three vital matches in a week.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think we must win the three games,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are three competitions. If we win tomorrow we will continue in the Capital One Cup. If we win the derby on Sunday we are trying to go for first place in the table. And if we win next Wednesday we are going to take a huge step to qualifying in the Champions League. So they are three games that are very important and I am sure the squad is prepared to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Samir Nasri returns to City\xe2\x80\x99s squad after recovering ahead of schedule from a groin injury.</p> <p>Newcastle are likely to be without Papiss Ciss\xc3\xa9 but Ryan Taylor could make his first appearance since August 2012 after two cruciate injuries. Sami Hyypia comes up against familiar foes on Wednesday when he takes his Brighton side to Tottenham.</p> <p>Hyypia regularly faced Spurs during his successful 10 years as a centre-half with Liverpool. The Finn is finding management in England rather tougher, with Brighton one place above the relegation zone after 10 Championship matches without a win.</p> <p>However, Hyypia has urged his struggling side to play with no fear at White Hart Lane.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very important that we concentrate on how we play there and how we present ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the Argus. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to have the courage; we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to fear them. They have good individuals and they can really hurt you if they are on top of their game but we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to fear them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The winger Kazenga LuaLua is back in the squad after a one-match ban but Sam Baldock is cup-tied. Another striker, Craig Mackail-Smith, could miss out with a hamstring injury and the right-back Bruno is struggling with groin trouble.</p> <p>Stoke have changed their tactics for defending set-pieces over concerns that Ryan Shawcross is being singled out by referees. The Stoke captain gave away a penalty in the 2-1 win over Swansea this month for grappling with Wilfried Bony and was deployed at Southampton last weekend as a zonal defender.</p> <p>The assistant manager, Mark Bowen said: \xe2\x80\x9cIn Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game we tried to pull him out of the spotlight. Instead of him actually marking from a corner, we put him in an area where he could just go and attack the ball, which is not his game \xe2\x80\x93 he\xe2\x80\x99s not been brought up on that.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt comes to something when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to try to change your system of marking around because you\xe2\x80\x99re worried that the lad is getting targeted.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Stoke fear they may be without Robert Huth for several weeks because of a calf injury.</p> <p>Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s manager, Ronald Koeman, is expecting another tough game after the 1-0 win over these opponents on Saturday. He may rest some key players but insists he will not make wholesale changes.</p>'
