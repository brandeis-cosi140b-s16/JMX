b'Chelsea doctor asked three times for stretchers after Zouma injury, says Cech'


b'<p>Petr Cech has revealed Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s doctor had to ask more than three times for the stretcher bearers to attend the stricken Kurt Zouma at Derby County on Tuesday night, though the goalkeeper believes his helmet saved the French defender from more serious injury following their \xe2\x80\x9chuge hit\xe2\x80\x9d of heads.</p> <p>The accident occurred near the close of the first half of Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s 3-1 Capital One Cup quarter-final victory at the iPro Stadium. Cech punched away a Derby corner and in doing so collided with Zouma.</p> <p>With Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho imploring the stretcher carriers to hurry up and Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas and C\xc3\xa9sar Azpilicueta following their manager\xe2\x80\x99s lead, Cech said the club\xe2\x80\x99s doctor, Eva Carneiro, had to ask them repeatedly to enter the field.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEva was saying at least three times prior to that through the radio: \xe2\x80\x98Bring the stretcher,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Cech said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe could hear it. I think that was why everyone was upset with the call. We heard: \xe2\x80\x98Bring the stretchers;\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Bring the stretchers;\xe2\x80\x99 and: \xe2\x80\x98Bring the stretchers.\xe2\x80\x99 But nobody was coming. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s why the players got involved. Overall I think the situation was handled well, everybody did the right thing. The main objective was to make sure the player was safe and he is safe.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>After the match Mourinho said he had been concerned and frustrated at the length of time before the stretcher arrived though the manager said he was informed of the bearers\xe2\x80\x99 instruction that they are not allowed to run.</p> <p>Cech suffered a horrific head injury in October 2006 at Reading during Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s first Chelsea tenure. Last year the Portuguese claimed the goalkeeper was \xe2\x80\x9cdying\xe2\x80\x9d following the clash with Reading\xe2\x80\x99s Stephen Hunt that left Cech motionless having fractured his skull. Since then Cech has worn protective headgear and he believes this may have prevented Zouma from being more hurt.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think we clashed with heads. I had a huge hit on my right side and obviously when I got the ball away I was looking where the ball goes and it was a punch so I was happy with that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cech. \xe2\x80\x9cBut then I saw him lying on the floor. I was a bit concerned because we collided with a heavy clash.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think it was lucky he hit my helmet because the impact would have been much bigger. I think the helmet saved him, me as well. Because he hit most of the helmet and took away a little bit of the impact. He\xe2\x80\x99s fine, the medical staff did really well to assess the situation. In this kind of clash you never know. He did not look so good to continue. Obviously it was the right choice. Now he is all clear hopefully. He is sitting there happy we won the game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     C\xc3\xa9sar Azpilicueta and Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas help carry Kurt Zouma off the field on a stretcher.

Cech was asked if the incident brought back memories of his own head injury. \xe2\x80\x9cIn football you have this situation quite often. You have the cross and everybody wants to win the header so there is always a possibility you will collide with someone.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a common thing in football. So not every clash makes me think of that one,\xe2\x80\x9d he said before referring to the similar head injury Hugo Lloris suffered in November last year when he collided with one of Romelu Lukaku\xe2\x80\x99s knees when Tottenham Hotspur played Everton. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you see for example the Lloris one you say: \xe2\x80\x98Oh, he was lucky,\xe2\x80\x99 because it was a similar situation. But on that one [Zouma] no.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor was there quickly, everybody was there making sure he was OK. Our medical team and the referees they did really well. The other guys took a little bit of time but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the player was in danger at that time because the doctor was with him, Eva was with him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea are now in next month\xe2\x80\x99s semi-finals. \xe2\x80\x9cWe knew it was going to be a difficult night, they [Derby] have been flying this season,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cech, who wants the club to target all four trophies they remain in contention for. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot say: \xe2\x80\x98We leave this competition, we chase this competition,\xe2\x80\x99 because in that competition you pick you have one unlucky game and you have nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>n Monday Chelsea found out they will face Paris Saint-Germain, with their former player David Luiz, in the last 16 of the Champions League. Cech said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was my guess prior to the draw. So I was sitting there saying to the guys, we would have him or [Ricardo] Carvalho [of Monaco]. We got PSG. It will be interesting to see. Last season was a big match for us; we lost away then we had to chase the game at home and did really well. This time I expect the game to be as difficult as it was last year but let\xe2\x80\x99s see what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Cech believes this Chelsea team can be compared to those from Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s successful first spell at the club only once a trophy has been won.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI keep saying you can only judge teams at the end of the season when you see how much the team achieve,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause in this moment we have been doing remarkably well but we have no trophy in our hands. So let\xe2\x80\x99s see what\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the case at the end of the season. Obviously this team has the potential and the quality to become one of the best teams in the Chelsea history if it proves by winning the trophies.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
