b'The Fiver | A scene that would have been amusing were it not actually serious'


b'DRONING ON <p>In the high-level meeting The Fiver has with The Man to settle upon a topic for this light-hearted and theoretically amusing daily missive, we usually come to a mutual decision that is satisfactory to both parties and appropri \xe2\x80\xa6 oh, who are we kidding? We can only dream of such utopian working conditions. In reality, we hide under our desk until 4.53pm, when The Man finds us, drags us out by our lughole, barks spittle-flecked orders and threatens to thrash us silly with a riding crop, before thrashing us silly with a riding crop. And today, The Man decreed we should find some escapist funnies from the Serbia v Albania game, which was abandoned following an almighty stramash in response to some bright spark droning a flag on to the pitch, recalling centuries of animosity, socio-political tensions and often violent rivalry. LOLZ! A hilarity picnic! Plenty of side-splitting possibilities there! Bring the funnies, Fiver!</p> <p>The game started with the most likely cause of violence being the presence of former Sunderland hardcase Lorik Cana, a man who laughs at the small-thinking Dennis Wise for merely being able to start a fight in an empty room when he prefers to fill a vacant chamber with a full-scale riot that requires a team of police armed with cattle-prods and tear gas to disperse. However the drone, carrying a flag with the controversial \xe2\x80\x98Greater Albania\xe2\x80\x99 insignia emblazoned upon it, soon buzzed into sight and Serbia\xe2\x80\x99s Stefan Mitrovic very politely elected to tidy up the field of play by grabbing it and searching for the nearest safe place in which to store it, presumably because he was worried about it getting muddy should it land on the Belgrade turf. Mitrovic\xe2\x80\x99s concern was clearly misinterpreted as some sort of disrespectful act, and the cow dung very much hit the fan in a scene that would have been highly amusing were it not actually highly serious.</p> <p>Various fights broke out, which then split into an array of auxiliary scraps, a fan charged on to the pitch and gave Mitrovic a belt round the head with some spare garden furniture that was lying around for some reason, and even a steward got involved, wailing on a prone player like The Man on The Fiver. If you removed the historical context and added some BONK and CLANG sound effects over the top, possibly along with some Batman-style KABLAM! and POW! graphics, then it would have been the laugh-fest that The Man expects the Fiver to make it.</p> <p>The whole business was initially blamed on Olsi Rama, the brother of Albania\xe2\x80\x99s president Edi Rama, with fingers pointing at him for flying the drone into the ground in the first place, and scurrilous rumours claiming he had his collar felt by the local fuzz while he clasped a remote control in his hands. Not so, according to Olsi. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never used a drone in my life, only bought my son a toy helicopter,\xe2\x80\x9d he parped.</p> <p>Of course, Uefa can console themselves with the knowledge that this was all a massive surprise, and nobody could ever have seen it coming. After all, it\xe2\x80\x99s only one of the most combustible regions in the world, and tensions have only existed for centuries, and there\xe2\x80\x99s only been strong animosity between the two countries for the last 100-odd years. Also, Albania haven\xe2\x80\x99t played in Serbia since 1967 and an Albanian prime minister hasn\xe2\x80\x99t visited since 1948, but we\xe2\x80\x99re sure that\xe2\x80\x99s just because the travel links are a bit iffy. Still, let those two countries play each other but keep Spain and Gibraltar apart, for fear that they might get a bit scrappy. Cool! Job done! Congrats Uefa, another one in the eye for those that think you\xe2\x80\x99re just a bunch of incompetent goons with no concept of the wider world! Take the rest of the day o \xe2\x80\xa6 oh, we see \xe2\x80\x93 you already have.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI am saving it for life. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to trade it for anything. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to frame it, put it on the wall and then treasure it\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Hong Kong striker Christian Kwesi Annan perhaps has his priorities wrong after being more concerned about getting hold of Lionel Messi\xe2\x80\x99s shirt than the fact his side were shellacked 7-0 by Argentina.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel.

Also, on the subject of Hart, while the idea of a manager screaming into a megaphone during the game would get annoying in a hurry, if England were to adopt this then Mr Roy would at least drown out the sound of the England Supporters\xe2\x80\x99 Band for those closest to the dugout.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ed Quoth the Raven.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFollowing Big Paper\xe2\x80\xb2s premonition of a lacklustre tie between Serbia and Albania, and the subsequent aerial arrival, resulting in some newsworthy interplay between the protagonists, am I to now pay attention when our terrestrial football providers big up a match between Crystal Palace and Stoke City in the hope of a drone more interesting than Martin Tyler\xe2\x80\xb2s?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ifor Jones.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFinally a genuinely practical use for The Fiver: providing synonyms for \xe2\x80\x98he said\xe2\x80\x99 for my upcoming Great USA!

Pravda, of course, was the leading newspaper in the Soviet Union. So, unless Lord Ferg was for some reason using the in-house Manchester United TV program to dictate an opinion piece to Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s in-house fanzine, your sentence should have read \xe2\x80\x98... he Vremya-ed\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Asim Thakore (and no other comrades).</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
