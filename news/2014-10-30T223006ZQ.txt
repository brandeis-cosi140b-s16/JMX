b'QPR\xe2\x80\x99s Harry Redknapp hits out at FA over Rio Ferdinand ban for tweet'


b'<p>Harry Redknapp said he was dismayed at the Football Association\xe2\x80\x99s decision to hand Rio Ferdinand a three-game ban and \xc2\xa325,000 fine for his controversial \xe2\x80\x9csket\xe2\x80\x9d tweet, claiming the severity of the suspension did not \xe2\x80\x9cequate\xe2\x80\x9d to offences such as violent conduct.</p> <p>The 35-year-old former England captain directed a jibe at a follower who criticised him last month containing the word \xe2\x80\x9csket\xe2\x80\x9d, which means \xe2\x80\x9ca promiscuous girl or woman\xe2\x80\x9d, leading to the FA charge. It is the second time Ferdinand has been reprimanded by the governing body for his use of Twitter following his endorsement of a \xe2\x80\x9cchoc ice\xe2\x80\x9d description of Ashley Cole in 2012.</p> <p>The QPR manager praised Ferdinand as a \xe2\x80\x9ctop-class person\xe2\x80\x9d and could not grasp how an exchange on social media could provoke the same penalty as a dangerous, two-foot challenge. \xe2\x80\x9cIf someone slags him off and he goes back and slags them off, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t equate. I can\xe2\x80\x99t see it,\xe2\x80\x9d Redknapp said.</p> <p>QPR were expecting the full report from the FA late on Thursday and planned to deliberate the reasoning behind the ban with the player\xe2\x80\x99s advisers before deciding whether or not to appeal. The Ferdinand camp is aware that the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive, Richard Scudamore, escaped FA sanction recently when sexist emails were made public.</p> <p>If Ferdinand does appeal, which will delay any ban, he will be available for selection for QPR\xe2\x80\x99s match at Chelsea on Saturday which would see him come face to face with John Terry, who was charged by the FA in 2012 for racially abusing Ferdinand\xe2\x80\x99s brother, Anton.</p> <p>While Redknapp said the club are still weighing up whether to appeal, he believes there is no need to talk to Ferdinand about his conduct. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen the FA report so we really can\xe2\x80\x99t comment. We\xe2\x80\x99re not sure exactly what he\xe2\x80\x99s done and what the charge is and what the reasons are behind it. So until we see that, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen it, we\xe2\x80\x99re not in a position to comment on it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not spoken to Phil [QPR\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive Philip Beard], the chairman or Rio about it. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to sit down and see what the circumstances are. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about it.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRio does know how to behave off the pitch, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not had many footballers behave better off the pitch than Rio, on the pitch and off the pitch. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any problems with the way Rio conducts himself. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t met many classier footballers in my time than Rio Ferdinand, he\xe2\x80\x99s a top-class person. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need to talk to him about it, not really.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>By his own admission, Redknapp has \xe2\x80\x9cno interest\xe2\x80\x9d in Twitter and would be quite relieved to see it banned in football. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never read it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where you get it from. Every day someone has got something to say on Twitter. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand. It would be easier \xe2\x80\x93 it would save all the hassle \xe2\x80\x93 if no one was on Twitter.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Another player Redknapp is unsure about including in the squad is Adel Taraabt. Following their recent public verbal spat about the player\xe2\x80\x99s weight, they had a meeting earlier in the week and Redknapp has been impressed by Taraabt\xe2\x80\x99s improved attitude since.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOn Monday he apologised,\xe2\x80\x9d Redknapp said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe knows what he said wasn\xe2\x80\x99t right but people put him up to it. It happens in life. If he was to make the most of what he\xe2\x80\x99s got he could be a world-class player. Adel\xe2\x80\x99s got the ability to be one of the best players in the Premier League. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to put him in the squad. He\xe2\x80\x99s trained very well this week. If he trains well and wants to do well he can turn a game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Contemplating the complex balance between Taraabt\xe2\x80\x99s ability and the attitude to make the most of it made Redknapp ponder the curious case of Ravel Morrison, who has consistently struggled to give his talent the solid platform to flourish. The former Manchester United prospect who has been drifting between clubs over the past two years has started one match since joining Cardiff on loan.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d love to see great players produce what they\xe2\x80\x99re capable of,\xe2\x80\x9d Redknapp said. \xe2\x80\x9cRavel Morrison should be playing for England with that ability \xe2\x80\x93 one of the most talented players I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in the game. When I worked with him I thought he was one of the most talented footballers I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in my life. He should be playing for Barcelona or Real Madrid. That\xe2\x80\x99s how good I thought Ravel Morrison was. It\xe2\x80\x99s sad. It\xe2\x80\x99s a shame, a waste.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
