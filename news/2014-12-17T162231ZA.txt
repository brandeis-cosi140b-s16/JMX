b'Andr\xc3\xa9 Villas-Boas: Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s Daniel Levy broke promises over new players'


b'<p>Andr\xc3\xa9 Villas-Boas has accused the Tottenham chairman, Daniel Levy, of not keeping his promises over signing new players during the Portuguese\xe2\x80\x99s tenure at the club.</p> <p>A year to the day since he left Spurs, the former Chelsea manager spoke in detail about the circumstances surrounding his departure but admitted \xe2\x80\x9cit was an experience I needed to have\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Villas-Boas, manager of the Russian side Zenit St Petersburg, spent 18 months at Spurs before being replaced by Tim Sherwood. He claimed that the club failed to sign any of the players he had earmarked to help replace Gareth Bale after the Welshman joined Real Madrid for a world record \xc2\xa385.3m and hinted that the director of football, Franco Baldini, is set to leave in the near future.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe chairman proposed a challenge to increase Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s competitive level, but immediately [Luka] Modric left and we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get any of the targets I had identified such as Jo\xc3\xa3o Moutinho, Willian, Oscar or Leandro Dami\xc3\xa3o,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Portuguese television. \xe2\x80\x9cThese were promises that were not kept. I had a group of players I had not chosen. In two years I lost [Rafael] van der Vaart, Modric, Bale, and all the promises made were unfulfilled.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Villas-Boas added: \xe2\x80\x9cTottenham set a points and victories record in my first season, missed out on the Champions League by one point and had a great run in the Europa League. In the second season, at the time I left we had more points than in the previous campaign. I ended up leaving by mutual agreement \xe2\x80\x93 I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sacked \xe2\x80\x93 because I gave full support to the football director Franco Baldini despite him having other ambitions, meaning that I ended up with players that did not fit the profile I wanted.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI speak of Franco Baldini, who came from AS Roma and is now in a down position, exiting the club. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t look at my time at Tottenham as a negative experience. It was an experience I needed to have.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Villas-Boas has guided Zenit to a seven-point lead in the Russian Premier League, although they failed to qualify for the last 16 of the Champions League. He insisted he has no intention of returning to English football despite claiming to have held talks with Liverpool.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI chose Zenit also to get away from the media glare. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had my fill of media sensationalism and false promises,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI had talks with Liverpool. Returning to England is definitely not in my plans, although life takes many turns.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cCoaching in England was a positive experience but also many negative things happened. I was surprised and I still am by the Chelsea chairman changing his intentions. When I went there in 2011 the idea was to reformulate the team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>On Wednesday night a Tottenham spokesman accused Villas-Boas of rewriting history. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate that Andr\xc3\xa9 has felt the need to pass comments like these,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNot only has he attempted to rewrite history, he has clearly forgotten the facts.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
