b'Burnley look like relegation certainties but fortunes could change with a win'


b'<p>The good news for Burnley, bottom of the table, still looking for their first win of the season and seemingly nailed on for a quick return to the Championship, is that Saturday brings what might be termed a winnable fixture at home to Hull City. The Tigers are no mugs under Steve Bruce and there is no reason why Burnley should approach the game with any particular confidence, but if a first win has to come from somewhere, then a home game against a team in the bottom half of the table, who lost their most recent game, is about as much as can be hoped for by a side in the Lancashire club\xe2\x80\x99s position.</p> <p>The bad news for Burnley is that Hull will see it as a winnable fixture too. That is what happens when you make a start as poor as Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s. Go to Manchester United or Arsenal and lose by the odd goal and your chairman and manager are practically buying drinks for each other on the way home. Go to the bottom club and somehow manage to allow the division\xe2\x80\x99s strugglers to record their first win of the season and the manager does not even want to catch the chairman\xe2\x80\x99s eye on the way home. There are some games that you are expected to win because you dare not lose, and Burnley are now probably beginning to appreciate that in all their remaining matches this season \xe2\x80\x93 28 of them \xe2\x80\x93 the teams are going to turn up feeling the same way.</p> <p>That is the danger of making a really bad start: other teams up their game against you and things can quickly go from bad to worse. This did not happen to Burnley the last time they were promoted to the Premier League, because within their first few games they had toppled Manchester United and Everton, held Manchester City away and had Turf Moor rocking with the sheer impudence of it all. No one seriously imagined they would become a Premier League fixture and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Then, as now, there was an apparent unwillingness to invest significantly in the team that contributed to Owen Coyle\xe2\x80\x99s fateful decision to jump ship to Bolton, but for the first half of the season at least Burnley gave it a good old go and everyone was pleased to see such a proud old club enjoying themselves.</p> <p>The first few fixtures are crucial, however, because if you are still winless after 10 games, as Burnley presently are, with a mere five goals scored and four points earned, you attract the wrong sort of attention.</p> <p>People start to mention Derby County in 2007-08, or Swindon Town in 1993-94, both bywords for Premier League failure on a catastrophic scale.</p> <p>Swindon were promoted under Glenn Hoddle, so long ago in Premier League history that top-flight teams still played 42 games per season, and were handicapped from the outset when their guiding hand left to become Chelsea manager. Never really equipped for Premier League life, even though the newly-invented rebrand was nothing like the cosmopolitan currency exchange we know today, the Robins waited 16 games for their first win and ended up conceding 100 goals as they were relegated with 30 points, below Sheffield United and Oldham Athletic. That said, Swindon did manage five wins over the course of the season, and thanks in part to Jan Age Fjortoft, scored more goals (47) than seven of the teams that finished above them.</p> <p>That record, and even Ipswich Town\xe2\x80\x99s in 1994-95, compares quite favourably to Derby\xe2\x80\x99s harrowing experience in 2007-08, when, first under Billy Davies, and then under Paul Jewell they set all sorts of new Premier League lows.</p> <p>Though their first win came after just six games (1-0 at home to Newcastle), it proved to be their only victory of the season. After setting a Premier League record of 32 subsequent games without a win, the Rams were relegated in March, another undistinguished first, with an all-time lowest points total of 11.</p> <p>Burnley seem to be on course for something in between those two ignominies. Certainly it is hard not to predict relegation for a team still winless by Bonfire night, though before the good folk of east Lancashire become too depressed there might be a couple of reasons for staying positive. One is Sean Dyche, who can be relied upon to keep a good team spirit going and is not going to leave the club in the foreseeable future. Under present managership, Burnley will pick up a win or two before the end of the season. Whether it is enough to save them is another matter, but once you have the first win the second becomes somewhat easier.</p> <p>If this sounds improbably optimistic, one only needs to look at Crystal Palace, who this time last year were in 20th place in the Premier League, an apparent basket case, with one win from their opening 11 games. Everybody knows what happened next, one of the greatest feats of escape and a marvellous advertisement for the coaching and firefighting skills of Tony Pulis, yet it all began with a win against Hull when the new manager had still to formally start work and was only watching from the stand. Either the Palace players were massively relieved to see the back of Ian Holloway or they had the fight in them all along.</p> <p>So much of football is about confidence it is difficult to draw firm conclusions even when the statistics are damning and the league table is doing its usual job of presenting the unpalatable truth. Pulis has been and gone now, but Palace are just about keeping their heads above water.</p> <p>The same Paul Jewell who found it impossible to turn Derby around was the one who defied every expectation at Wigan, when the Latics came up \xe2\x80\x93 in 2005 \xe2\x80\x93 for what everyone assumed would be a brief and painful look around the Premier League and ended up staying for eight seasons. Jewell was only there for the first two of them, and he did enjoy a certain amount of financial backing from his chairman, but it was the confidence he instilled in the players and the fans, right from the first, difficult day against Chelsea, that set the tone for what was to come.</p> <p>Dyche\xe2\x80\x99s problem at Burnley is that the tone has already been set, and short of spending a fortune in January or sending for Pulis it is not easy to see what single action could bring about a change in fortune.</p> <p>But a first win could make a difference, and if you look closely at the league table you can see it might not be telling the whole truth. Burnley might look to be the team most in trouble, as indeed they probably are, but at least they have two points from their last six games. That is two more than Aston Villa, who have lost six in a row, conceding 15 goals and scoring just one in the process. There may be no truth in the rumour, allegedly started by Stan Collymore on Twitter, that Villa are sounding out Pulis. But you can see why they might. Burnley are not the only ones in trouble.</p>'
