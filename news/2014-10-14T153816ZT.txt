b'The Fiver | A 12-storey crisis'


b'THERE MAY BE TROUBLE AHEAD \xe2\x80\xa6 <p>The word \xe2\x80\x9ccrisis\xe2\x80\x9d, like the word \xe2\x80\x9clegend\xe2\x80\x9d, is overused these days. Indeed, the only things more overused than the words legend/crisis is the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cthe words legend/crisis are overused these days\xe2\x80\x9d. And it\xe2\x80\x99s almost always followed with \xe2\x80\x9cBut \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d before the speaker goes on to frame something that is in no way a crisis and based on spurious hyperbole, knee-jerk reactions and a tiny sample size as a bona fide, no-but-seriously-this-really-is-a-crisis-not-like-those-other-ones crisis.</p> <p>With that in mind, the Fiver can say, without doubt, question or fear of contradiction, that three games after winning the World Cup, Germany are in crisis. A large crisis. In fact, if you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a moment, it\xe2\x80\x99s a 12-storey crisis with a magnificent entrance hall, carpeting throughout, 24-hour porterage, and an enormous sign on the roof, saying \xe2\x80\x9cThis Is a Large Crisis\xe2\x80\x9d. We really aren\xe2\x80\x99t sure how they are going to get out of this one. They have, after all, lost two games! Two games from three! A 66% failure record! Chuck that World Cup trophy in the bin Jogi, it\xe2\x80\x99s old news. Stop banging on about it like it means something. It was three months ago, man. Get with the times and stop living in the past.</p> <p>And the bad news just keeps on coming for the embattled Germans, because arriving in town tonight is the rampaging, unstoppable force they call the Republic O\xe2\x80\x99Ireland, fresh from giving Gibraltar a firm walloping last time out. Such is the state Germany find themselves in, The Bloke That Stands Next To Roy Keane (or \xe2\x80\x9cO\xe2\x80\x99Ireland manager Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Neill\xe2\x80\x9d as he\xe2\x80\x99s sometimes also known) is set to go easy on them, generously giving the visitors a sporting chance of possibly eking out a result by playing Shane Long up top, which is sort of like promising that every player will only use their weaker foot. And good on him. We don\xe2\x80\x99t want another of those embarrassing, one-sided qualifiers where there is no competition and nobody really gets anything from the whole experience. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll be formidable opponents,\xe2\x80\x9d The Bloke That Stands Next To Roy Keane charitably parped, showing that he\xe2\x80\x99s not taking this for granted, and won\xe2\x80\x99t allow any complacency to creep in ahead of their inevitable victory.</p> <p>At the very least, one would imagine all the Ireland players know who they\xe2\x80\x99re facing tonight, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t say the same for Germany\xe2\x80\x99s, with Real Madrid string-puller Toni Kroos tweeting (in English, for reasons unclear) this afternoon: \xe2\x80\x9cMatchday!!! #GERSCO.\xe2\x80\x9d Of course it\xe2\x80\x99s actually #GERIRE, whereas just down the road (it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty long road) is #POLSCO, with Wee Gordon Strachan\xe2\x80\x99s men taking on Robert Lewandowski, Wojciech Szczesny and chums, the chaps who helped spark #GERCRISIS by giving them what for at the weekend. \xe2\x80\x9cI think this is the hardest group, I have always thought that, and Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s results show that,\xe2\x80\x9d squeaked Strachan, peering over the edge of the table from atop his booster seat. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are going to be ups and downs.\xe2\x80\x9d Of course if this season\xe2\x80\x99s previous meetings between a team from Scotland and one from Poland are anything to go by, the Poles will comprehensively outplay and beat their opponents, before it emerges they have committed a minor admin error that had no impact on the result whatsoever, in response to which Uefa suits will lick their collective pencils and give the points to the losers anyway.</p> <p>We tell you who ain\xe2\x80\x99t losers though, and that\xe2\x80\x99s Norn Iron. If Germany are in crisis (and, let us not forget, they most definitely, absolutely are) then the Norn Ironish are in \xe2\x80\xa6 whatever the opposite of crisis is, chasing an unprecedented third qualifying victory on the spin when they face Greece. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe in the team,\xe2\x80\x9d hollered manager man Michael O\xe2\x80\x99Neill before ripping off his shirt, Hulk Hogan-style, cupping one hand behind his ear, firing up I Am a Real American and elbow-dropping the nearest Greek bystander. \xe2\x80\x9cI think there is a sense that some people can get carried away and we are looked at as all conquering,\xe2\x80\x9d he well-let-me-tell-you-something-brothered, revealing himself to have very much got carried away by suggesting that anyone, anywhere might reckon his team are anything close to \xe2\x80\x98all conquering\xe2\x80\x99. Perhaps O\xe2\x80\x99Neill has just caught European Championship qualifying campaign fever. The Fiver sure has \xe2\x80\x93 we got the fever and we don\xe2\x80\x99t want no cure. Who\xe2\x80\x99s with us?</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Scott Murray from 7.45pm BST for MBM coverage of Poland 2-0 Scotland, while Simon Burnton is on hand for Germany 3-1 Republic O\xe2\x80\x99Ireland.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I say I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry it\xe2\x80\x99s because I regret something. Being sorry implies regret. But they have also sometimes judged me on things that aren\xe2\x80\x99t true, such as the racism thing. I was accused without evidence and that\xe2\x80\x99s what grieved me the most. The others were actions when it was me who did wrong. I accepted that and begged forgiveness, but the racism thing, when I was accused without evidence, that did upset me\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 three years on and Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez won\xe2\x80\x99t let it lie.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel.

Lenny\xe2\x80\x99s followed on from Ronny Deila\xe2\x80\x99s ban on chips, ketchup and fizzy drinks by banning bobble hats from the training ground. \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want players training in hats because they don\xe2\x80\x99t play football in hats,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that\xe2\x80\x99ll have the Trotters back in the Premier League in no time. Probably best to ban dungarees, Cuban-heeled shoes, tabards, and novelty cuff-links too, just in case\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Johnny Connelly.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI hope Marc Sinfield\xe2\x80\x99s prediction about Sol Campbell doing one to Ukip doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come true (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters), if only because it implies that Ukip will go on to win the following election without losing a seat. At least we would be able to look forward to an increasingly erratic Nigel Farage going on to lead them into an extended, possibly permanent period of underachievement\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Tom Goodfellow.</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

WIN! <p>Want a football table signed by the Chelsea first-team squad and a day\xe2\x80\x99s training at Cobham? Then enter this here competition.</p> BITS AND BOBS <p>More bad news for Arsenal fans. After the revelation that Olivier Giroud will soon be back to full fitness, Tomas Rosicky has gone and picked up some leg-knack on international duty. \xe2\x80\x9cThe doctor said I have something swollen between the muscles,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, possibly with a wink.</p> <p>Neymar has fully cemented his reputation as the greatest footballer ever to take to a football field by scoring all four goals in an utterly meaningless friendly win over Japan.</p> <p>Wales boss Chris Coleman is a relieved man after his 10 men held on to beat Cyprus 2-1 in Euro 2016 qualifying last night. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he sends one of ours off, surely he can send one or two of theirs off,\xe2\x80\x9d he wibbled. \xe2\x80\x9cThey weren\xe2\x80\x99t shy either.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Lord Ferg, the man who thought that appointing David Moyes would be a good idea, reckons Louis van Gaal is doing a bang-up job. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce I got settled into the club, everything was fine. Louis is going through that same process and there\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt in my mind that he will sort it out,\xe2\x80\x9d he Pravdaed to the in-house TV team.</p> <p>Robbie Fowler has jumped in front of all the haters criticising a 19-year-old for admitting that he is a bit tired. \xe2\x80\x9cI take my hat off to Raheem,\xe2\x80\x9d chapeaued Fowler. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m chuffed that he had the guts to speak up and say what we did as it showed maturity. It was a selfless act and people are wrong to have a go at him. What he did was for the benefit of the team. Not everyone puts the team first like that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>And, saving the best for last, the Red Insure Cup showdown between Hitchin Town and Arlesey Town had to be stopped so that a hedgehog could be removed from the pitch. \xe2\x80\x9cThe linesman tried to take it off himself but I think he must have had his hand pr1cked,\xe2\x80\x9d honked Hitchin club secretary Roy Izzard. \xe2\x80\x9cThe referee investigated and he more bravely put it over a fence.\xe2\x80\x9d Arlesey won 6-5 on penalties.</p> RECOMMENDED VIEWING            <p>Will the return of Zlatan spark a winning run for PSG? Julien Laurens looks ahead to the forthcoming Ligue 1 action. And Andy Brassell ponders the question we pore over more than the meaning of life: who is the greatest goalscorer \xe2\x80\x93 Leo Messi or Telmo Zarra?</p> STILL WANT MORE? <p>If you thought you knew about 40 of the best young footballers in the world who were born in 1997, then you were probably telling porkies. Check out this interactive and load up on KNOWLEDGE.</p> <p>If you thought Walsall versus Shrewsbury Town was as big as football rivalry gets, then you were wrong. Very wrong. It\xe2\x80\x99s Albania against Serbia tonight and Sasa Ibrulj has the lowdown.</p> <p>If you thought Guus Hiddink taking charge of Holland would be as successful as an underwater hair dryer, then you were right. Bart Vlietstra explains where it has all gone wrong for the Dutch.</p> <p>If you thought that Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Neill was the only person foolish enough to think that O\xe2\x80\x99Ireland will get anything other than an whooping from their match in Germany, then you were wrong. Ian McCourt does too.</p> <p>If you thought Roy Keane\xe2\x80\x99s Hong Kong hoe-down with Peter Schmeichel would be replicated as Rocky IV, then you may have sent in an entry to this week\xe2\x80\x99s Gallery.</p>     The Gallery.
