b'<p>The co-president of St Etienne Bernard Caiazzo has called on Uefa to take action to stop the Premier League becoming \xe2\x80\x9cthe NBA of football\xe2\x80\x9d after it receives a record \xc2\xa35.14bn from its latest TV deal.</p> <p>Caiazzo believes France\xe2\x80\x99s Ligue 1 and other leagues in Europe will be left behind by the English top flight at the start of the 2016-17 season, when the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s TV revenue will stand at around \xc2\xa38.5bn for three years, taking into account the value of international rights.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe Premier League will become the NBA of football. It will be greater than the Champions League. Clubs such as Manchester United or Chelsea will have budgets of \xe2\x82\xac700 or \xe2\x82\xac800m,\xe2\x80\x9d he was quoted as saying in the French media. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is happening in England will impact on Germany, Italy, Spain. And I do not imagine that Uefa will not react. But there will be a greater attention if the request comes from Bayern [Munich], Real [Madrid] , Barcelona or Milan instead of St Etienne.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Caiazzo\xe2\x80\x99s comments are of particular interest given that he recently confirmed that St Etienne are in talks with Manchester City over the possibility of creating a partnership that will allow the Premier League club to benefit from the French club\xe2\x80\x99s young talent.</p> <p>Caiazzo told the Independent: \xe2\x80\x9cIt all looks very serious. City have been impressed by our talent for producing players of Champions League standard. These people are willing to work in depth.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
