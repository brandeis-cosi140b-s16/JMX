b'The Fiver: Undeserved rapturous applause and unconditional love'


b'EMMANUEL PETTY <p>Emmanuel Adebayor tells the apparently true story of how, as a child, he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t yet walked at the age of four years old. At a loss to know what to do with her son, his mother carried him all over Africa in search of a \xe2\x80\x9ccure\xe2\x80\x9d. The pair eventually ended up in a church where priests had promised to pray for him for a week, telling his mother that if he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t walking by then he never would. Seven days later, with his deadline fast approaching, Adebayor was reclining on a bench in the church when \xe2\x80\xa6 well, let\xe2\x80\x99s it hear it straight from the horse\xe2\x80\x99s mouth.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAnyway, I was in the church laying down and, around nine or 10 o\xe2\x80\x99clock on the Sunday morning, I could hear children playing outside,\xe2\x80\x9d he has previously revealed. \xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly somebody kicked a ball into the church and the first person to stand up and run was me because I wanted to get that ball.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>While a cynic might argue that Adebayor hasn\xe2\x80\x99t shown that kind of determination to chase a ball in 26 years since, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be entirely correct. As with his infant years, his football career seems to have consisted of long periods of being carried by others, punctuated by the occasional sprint towards a ball when his contract is up for renewal. An undeniably talented but frustrating player who has had to deal with well documented personal traumas, Adebayor\xe2\x80\x99s work ethic has long been a source of frustration with the fans of various teams he has played for throughout a career in which he has always conveyed the impression he would rather be somewhere else.</p> <p>And today it was confirmed he would rather be somewhere else; anywhere but White Hart Lane, where he claims the sound of jeers are making it difficult for him and his team-mates to go about the business of not losing against teams such as Stoke, West Brom, Liverpool In Crisis and Resurgent Newcastle. \xe2\x80\x9cInstead of booing people, which will make it even worse, I think it is sometimes better to support them and give them what they need to perform on the pitch,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adebayor who, despite earning \xc2\xa3170,000 per week, apparently needs the added incentive of undeserved rapturous applause and unconditional love to rouse him out of his current torpor.</p> <p>In a lengthy soliloquy in which he praised his manager Mauricio Pochettino while tacitly trying to make out everything that\xe2\x80\x99s going wrong at Spurs is the Argentinian\xe2\x80\x99s fault, Adebayor suggested it might be a relief for Spurs to play away from home at Hull City after the international break because apparently the beer-fuelled derision of angry fans wearing over-priced amber and black polyester is less hurtful than that of those in white.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAt least you know I am going to be having the majority of opposition fans booing me rather than our own fans booing me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I am not just talking about me, I am speaking on behalf of all the players.\xe2\x80\x9d As in the other players actually playing, while Emmanuel once again revisits his childhood by reclining on a bench.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI remember one match as a youth player where we won 42-0, with me scoring 11 goals\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Fernando Llorente on Spanish youth football, the best in the world.</p> MOTIVATIONAL SPEECH OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf [Edin] Dzeko can\xe2\x80\x99t play we will be resigned to playing for a draw against Israel because we have no hope of winning without him\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina coach Safet Susic takes a Hoover and sucks the last remaining confidence out of his squad before the Euro 2016 qualifier this weekend.</p> THE SECRET FOOTBALLER\xe2\x80\x99S GUIDE TO THE MODERN GAME \xe2\x80\x93 EXCLUSIVE OFFER FOR FIVER READERS <p>Fiver readers can get The Secret Footballer\xe2\x80\x99s Guide to the Modern Game for just \xc2\xa37.49 (RRP \xc2\xa312.99).

Does this make Wenger a late addition to STOP FOOTBALL, preferably right now without having to bother interrupting Christmas and Easter? Or is he to start a rival campaign: STOP FOOTBALL AT HALF-TIME?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Darren Leathley.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPlease could I win the letter of the day award today and a prize from Football Manager towers? I\xe2\x80\x99m currently playing the 2012 edition, I\xe2\x80\x99m in 2033, have won the Premier League and Big Cup with Leicester City, the World Cup back to back with Argentina in 2026 and Czech Republic in 2030 as well as rewriting club history at Kaiser Chiefs and Juventus. I only managed to win the Championship play-offs with Sheffield Wednesday. I feel now the Owls have Gary Taylor-Fletcher on loan that anything is possible for them in FM2015 (Good try Nev but no \xe2\x80\x93 Fiver Ed)\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Nev Briars.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhile reading my fellow pedants\xe2\x80\x99 responses to the rectangular tissue debate (Friday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters), I grabbed a roll of toilet paper to perform a visual check. Not being satisfied with such an obtuse and imprecise methodology, I proceeded to detach several individual pieces and then using a ruler I always keep nearby for just such emergencies proceeded to measure all four sides of the pieces. Based on my measurements I determined that of the seven pieces of Purex brand measured, five were square (10cm by 10cm) and two were indeed rectangular (10cm by 10.5cm). Thus it would be more technically correct to call toilet paper rectangular and not square, as only the majority of pieces are actually square, but all squares are rectangles\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Alex Murfin (1,056 other toilet paper pedants).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
