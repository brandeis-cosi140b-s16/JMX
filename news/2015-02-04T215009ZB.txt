b'<p>Liverpool scrape through, just, and will travel to Crystal Palace in the fifth round. What a second half, and what a finale. Bolton can consider themselves very unfortunate, but the dismissal of Danns was their undoing. And the brilliance of Phillipe Coutinho, Emre Can and Raheem Sterling has kept Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s 35th-birthday FA Cup final dream alive. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure I read something recently about Coutinho\xe2\x80\x99s inability to shoot,\xe2\x80\x9d concludes Matt Dony.
