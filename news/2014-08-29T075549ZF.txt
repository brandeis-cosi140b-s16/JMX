b'Football transfer rumours: Aston Villa to sign Tom Cleverley?'


b'<p>Poor old jiggered Aston Villa plan to make an \xc2\xa38m bid for Manchester United midfielder Tom Cleverley. If Paul Lambert had run around in panicked circles like this during the 1997 Champions League final, Juventus would have beaten Borussia Dortmund 908-0.</p> <p>Manchester United are also getting rid of Danny Welbeck, who is off to Tottenham Hotspur, and Shinji Kagawa, who is planning a return journey to Borussia Dortmund. Will this pave the way for a new big-name signing at Old Trafford? You\xe2\x80\x99d like to think so, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you.</p> <p>Milan really are serious about raiding the English league for Fernando Torres. It\xe2\x80\x99s like Luther Blissett and Mark Hateley never happened. Chelsea will throw whatever they get at Roma in order to fill the not particularly substantial gap Torres leaves with Mattia Destro, the Fabio Borini de nos jours.</p> <p>Luke Shaw might order out a pizza.</p> <p>Arsenal want Borussia Dortmund defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos, to the general dismay of MBM reporters who already struggle with Wojciech Szczesny, Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker. To be fair, they struggle with Kieran Gibbs and Mesut \xc3\x96zil as well, they\xe2\x80\x99re just not very good at typing.</p> <p>And yes, Manchester United are indeed going to purchase some more players. Arturo Vidal of Juventus and Daley Blind of Ajax are the much-mooted choices of Louis van Gaal, with Stromsgodset teen midfielder Martin Odegaard also expected to join. That\xe2\x80\x99ll be eight new signings this summer. Concerned comparisons to post-Bale Spurs will be coming along in a few minutes, some people are never happy.</p>'
