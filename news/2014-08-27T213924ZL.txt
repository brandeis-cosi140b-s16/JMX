b'<p>Liverpool will be hoping to avoid Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s recent trials in the Champions League and a swift reunion with Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez when the draw for the group stage takes place in Monaco on Thursday.</p> <p>City, Chelsea, Liverpool and Arsenal will discover their fate at the Grimaldi Forum from 4.45pm (BST), with Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 team facing potentially the toughest draw of the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s representatives among the European elite.</p> <p>Rodgers guided Liverpool back into the Champions League after a four-year absence last season but their Uefa coefficient based on the past five years has placed the Anfield club in pot three in the draw, and at risk of a daunting reintroduction to the competition.</p> <p>The European champions, Real Madrid, the Spanish champions, Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid, the German champions, Bayern Munich, and Su\xc3\xa1rez\xe2\x80\x99s Barcelona are all possible opponents for Liverpool in pot one. Su\xc3\xa1rez, who joined Barcelona from Liverpool for \xc2\xa375m this summer, is suspended for the first three group matches of this season\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League due to the four-month ban he received for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup, but would be available for the teams\xe2\x80\x99 second encounter.</p> <p>The big-spending Paris Saint-Germain, the Italian champions Juventus, Borussia Dortmund and Shakhtar Donetsk, with all the logistical problems a game against Ukrainian opposition would entail, lurk in pot two, with Roma and Radamel Falcao\xe2\x80\x99s Monaco the stand-out teams in pot four. Having witnessed the problems a lower Uefa coefficient has caused City for the past three seasons, Liverpool would have few complaints with a group comprising Porto, Basel and Celtic\xe2\x80\x99s second Champions League conquerors of the season, Maribor.</p> <p>City are in pot two for the draw and should land an easier group than in recent campaigns, when their lower coefficient resulted in a group containing Bayern Munich, Napoli and Villarreal in 2011-12, and Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Ajax in 2012-13. Last season brought qualification from a group made up of Bayern, CSKA Moscow and Viktoria Plzen, only for their second-placed finish to result in a last-16 meeting and exit against Barcelona.</p> <p>Pablo Zabaleta hopes the higher seeding will finally help Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s side make a greater impact on the Champions League. The City defender said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe know we are Manchester City and have a strong squad to play against the best teams in Europe, so we will see the draw and this time if we have a little bit more luck than the last few years.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe were in the group of death and it has always been tough for us in the Champions League \xe2\x80\x93 but it is a competition we are looking forward to and hopefully we can do better. The rest of the teams see Manchester City as a tough team to have in the group and I think that is the most important thing for us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea and Arsenal, who confirmed their place in the draw with Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s 1-0 home win over Besiktas in the second leg of their play-off, are in pot one and will avoid the aforementioned European heavyweights plus Benfica and Porto, who qualified with a 2-0 play-off defeat (3-0 on aggregate) of Lille on Tuesday.</p> <p>At the draw in Monaco 32 teams will be placed into eight groups of four. The English clubs cannot be drawn into the same group as each other and as in previous seasons, the top two in each group will qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League and the third-placed side go into the knockout stages of the Europa League. The draw for the group stage of the Europa League takes place at noon (BST) on Friday.</p> Champions League qualifiers: <p>Pot 1</p> <p>Real Madrid Spain</p> <p>Barcelona Spain</p> <p>Bayern Munich Germany</p> <p>Chelsea England</p> <p>Benfica Portugal</p> <p>Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid Spain</p> <p>Arsenal England</p> <p>Porto Portugal</p> <p>Pot 2</p> <p>Schalke Germany</p> <p>Borussia Dortmund Germany</p> <p>Juventus Italy</p> <p>Paris Saint-Germain France</p> <p>Shakhtar Donetsk Ukraine</p> <p>Basel Switzerland</p> <p>Zenit St Petersburg Russia</p> <p>Manchester City England</p> <p>Pot 3</p> <p>Bayer Leverkusen Germany</p> <p>Olympiakos Greece</p> <p>CSKA Moscow Russia</p> <p>Ajax Netherlands</p> <p>Liverpool England</p> <p>Sporting Lisbon Portugal</p> <p>Galatasaray Turkey</p> <p>Athletic Bilbao Spain</p> <p>Pot 4</p> <p>Anderlecht Belgium</p> <p>Roma Italy</p> <p>L Razgrad Bul</p> <p>Apoel Cyprus</p> <p>Bate Borisov Belarus</p> <p>Maribor Slovenia</p> <p>Monaco France</p> <p>Malmo Sweden</p>'
