b'Louis van Gaal: a win at WBA can spark Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s title challenge'


b'<p>Louis van Gaal believes defeating West Bromwich Albion at The Hawthorns could inspire Manchester United to a title challenge, just as the Champions League victory over Juventus when he was in charge of Bayern Munich inspired the German club to win the Bundesliga. The manager said that a win on Monday evening could do for Manchester United what that 4-1 victory in Turin in December 2009 did for Bayern, which was to put them into the quarter-finals of the Champions League. From there, Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s side reached the final, losing to Internazionale, and won the German Cup as well.</p> <p>Van Gaal had a sticky start at Bayern, much as he has endured at Old Trafford this season, so he was happy to look back. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you remember when we had our revival?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe won 4-1 at Juventus, a fantastic game, and that gave us that psychological benefit.\xe2\x80\x9d He also cited United\xe2\x80\x99s inconsistency in the latter part of matches after they faded in the 2-1 win over Everton. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that was a very good game [Juventus] and against Everton we could not say it was very good. The first 60 minutes maybe, but a game lasts 90 minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>With United out of the Capital One Cup, Van Gaal insisted the catalyst could come against West Bromwich or from any league encounter. \xe2\x80\x9cThat can be any match but it cannot be every training session because a training session is different to a match, believe me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot simulate the match rhythm. We try to, but it\xe2\x80\x99s different.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea, Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal are all in the Champions League, and Van Gaal is not sure there is any benefit in having clear weeks to work with his squad. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you can play the Champions League, especially the Champions League but also the Europa League, you can compare yourselves as a team with the better players, with a higher level,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI have also a philosophy when I was a technical director of the [Holland] Federation I gave structure to the youth education that the better players have to play against the better players. Then you get development of your players because they are playing better opponents.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you are in the Champions League and it\xe2\x80\x99s going well and you beat opponents, you are coming in a flow and then it\xe2\x80\x99s not so bad to play all the matches.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe in my first year I have more chances to train with my players,\xe2\x80\x9d he acknowledged. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is probably better than all the matches maybe. But at the end of this it\xe2\x80\x99s always better to play in the Champions League and all the cups and play all the matches because you can compare yourself with higher-level opponents.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Gaal now has only Jesse Lingard, Paddy McNair, Jonny Evans and Antonio Valencia injured, though some of his returning players need to regain match fitness. Asked if United can win the Premier League when they are all back, Van Gaal said: \xe2\x80\x9cEvery team can win. You have your hopes but I do think there are stronger teams in the world now. We have to make a team and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I have a period of three years. I hope we can fulfil that dream that we have together.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s attention to detail and discontent at the lack of focus meant he showed the squad a video after the international break. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had an evaluation about Everton and the last 30 minutes because I think we have to be professional, re-evaluate and improve. And we have to learn from our faults.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
