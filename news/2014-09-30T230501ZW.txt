b'Which player has made the most distant debut? | The Knowledge'


b'<p>\xe2\x80\x9cFederico Fazio made his debut for Spurs the other night at the Partizan Stadium in Belgrade, a cool 1,700km or so from White Hart Lane (or a 20-hour drive according to Google Maps),\xe2\x80\x9d pondered Dave Miller last week. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this the furthest from his home ground a player has made his debut?\xe2\x80\x9d </p> <p>Fazio was practically on home soil compared to some of other globetrotting debutants. \xe2\x80\x9cI would like to nominate Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Conor Coady, who made his first team debut away at Anzhi Makhachkala in 2012,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Andrew Beasley. \xe2\x80\x9cGoogle Maps suggests it is a 4,589km drive from Anfield, which would take just 53 hours apparently.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>But that\xe2\x80\x99s still small fry. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure Russia provides a a bigger journey, but the A-league here in Australia has one of the longest journeys in domestic football: Perth-Wellington,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Tel Gunning. \xe2\x80\x9cA number of players have made their debuts in this fixture, the most recent being the young Perth goalie Jack Duncan back in March. The new season kicks off in a couple of weeks and Perth will start in Wellington, so Andy Keogh from Dublin should make his competitive debut for the Glory 5,255km from his home ground in Perth.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>A decent trek, but not the furthest. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Italian SuperCoppa has at times been played abroad in China and the US,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Mats Svendsen. \xe2\x80\x9cThe longest distance I can find is between Beijing and Turin, and in 2012 Kwadwo Asamoah and Lucio both made their Juventus debuts in Beijing 8,197km from home. Asamoah even scored a goal.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>When you want distant debutants, however, the Club World Cup is your go-to tournament. \xe2\x80\x9cPaul Rachubka made his United debut in the 2000 Club World Cup, held in Brazil in the Maracana Stadium - a cool 9,309.8km from Manchester,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Christopher Chan.</p> <p>Trumping that effort, though, is Alo\xc3\xadsio Jos\xc3\xa9 da Silva who, considering the furthest away any two points can be on earth is around 20,000km, made a debut that will be pretty hard to beat. \xe2\x80\x9cAlo\xc3\xadsio Jos\xc3\xa9 da Silva made a club debut approximately 18,500km away from his new home ground,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Tim Dockery. \xe2\x80\x9cIn July 2005, S\xc3\xa3o Paulo FC and Clube Atl\xc3\xa9tico Paranaense faced off in a home-and-away final of the 2005 Copa Libertadores. S\xc3\xa3o Paulo won 5-1 on aggregate (with Paranaense\xe2\x80\x99s sole goal coming from Alo\xc3\xadsio). As a result of winning the Libertadores, S\xc3\xa3o Paulo qualified for the 2005 Club World Cup. Between the Copa Libertadores and the Club World Cup, however, S\xc3\xa3o Paulo fared miserably domestically and sought out several reinforcements to improve its likelihood of winning the tournament. Among those reinforcements was S\xc3\xa3o Paulo\xe2\x80\x99s old foe Alo\xc3\xadsio, who made his debut for S\xc3\xa3o Paulo in the semi-finals of the 2005 Club World Cup in Tokyo against Al-Ittihad Football Club of Saudi Arabia. S\xc3\xa3o Paulo went on the beat Liverpool F.C. in the final of that competition, and Alo\xc3\xadsio appeared in another 60 games for S\xc3\xa3o Paulo.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> LONGEST UNBEATEN DUOS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cGoing into this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s matches after five (or more) matches played, there are two Premier League teams still undefeated, three Bundesliga teams undefeated, a whopping five La Liga teams undefeated, and two Serie A teams undefeated,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Bob Zoellner. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the furthest/most matches played into a season in a league with more than one team still undefeated?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The best we can do, Bob, is the 1998-99 Yugoslavian season. The campaign was abandoned after 24 games due to the war in the country and at that stage both Partizan Belgrade (P24 W21 D3 L0) and Obilic Belgrade (P24 W20 D4 L0) were unbeaten.</p> ONE-SIDED DERBIES <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhile watching a pre-match report on Portuguese TV recently, I learned that Lisbon\xe2\x80\x99s third club Belenenses had not won away to local rivals Sporting in over 60 years (a 1-1 draw at the Est\xc3\xa1dio Jos\xc3\xa9 Alvalade ensured this record continued),\xe2\x80\x9d Oliver Farry reported last week. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch unsuccessful streaks are not uncommon (I recall Spurs went more than 70 years without winning at Anfield before a 1-0 win in 1985 broke that duck) but are there worse instances in derby fixtures?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d suggest the Brugge derby has be one of the most one sided city derby in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Jamie McGrady. \xe2\x80\x9cClub Brugge have won 95 fixtures compared to Cercle Brugge\xe2\x80\x99s 31 wins with 34 games ending as draws. Going from your supremacy rating that\xe2\x80\x99s a humiliating 64. Since becoming a major force in Belgium and in Europe in the early 70\xe2\x80\x99s, Club have won 54 league fixtures and lost only eight to their rivals. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose a single game from 1972-81 (17 wins, 2 draws). Worst still for Cercle it includes a couple of 5-0\xe2\x80\x99s, a 6-1, an 8-1 and a 10-0 loss. Club Brugge also won both cup finals in which they appeared together.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Last week we also looked at the closest derby records. \xe2\x80\x9cYou missed the Wool City derby off the list of finely-balanced derbies - Bradford City against Bradford Park Avenue,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Paul Cook. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir league record reads 21-20 to Avenue, but add in the FA Cup and it\xe2\x80\x99s 22 wins apiece with 11 draws and a goal record of 81-77 to Avenue, on par with the closest derbies in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> FOODIES COMBOS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy team in the League of Ireland, Longford Town, played last week and Stephen Rice and Mark Salmon both scored,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Padraig Stapleton. \xe2\x80\x9cJust wondering if any similar food combos have ever scored in the same game? Or even played in the same team?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHow about Norway v Morocco in World Cup \xe2\x80\x9898?\xe2\x80\x9d writes Joe Rivers. \xe2\x80\x9cNorway scored twice courtesy of a Youssef Chippo own goal and a Dan Eggen strike. Therefore, their goals were scores by Eggen Chippo. I\xe2\x80\x99ve held this in my head for 16 years. It feels good to finally tell someone else about it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> PIZZA, GOLD DISCS AND SEXY CAR WASHES (2) <p>Last week we looked at the unusual bonuses awarded to players and teams for their on-field performances \xe2\x80\x93 featuring a lifetime supply of pizza, green Volkswagens and \xe2\x80\x9ca sexy car wash\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Colin McNicholas has been in touch with a doozy. \xe2\x80\x9cIt brought me back to the story of when 1994 World Cup winner Marcio Santos signed for Fiorentina. Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it true that they were owned at the time by a movie magnate of some description? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t he promise his Brazilian signing a date with Sharon Stone if he managed to notch a certain amount of goals? Or maybe it was all just a magical dream I had?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Well, we turned to our Italian football guru Paolo Bandini for the truth:</p>  The Santos story is an intriguing one. I have heard this tale many times before but never really known if it\xe2\x80\x99s just one of those things that got made up and repeated. Haven\xe2\x80\x99t got time at the moment for a really thorough dig, but I had a quick ping on the search engines of the major papers and came up with this article from La Repubblica on 4 August 1994.  It\xe2\x80\x99s written in an off-hand kind of way, using reported speech rather than an actual quote, but basically suggests that when Santos touched down in Florence, and was met by Italian reporters, he was talking about passions outside football and mentioned that he had a weakness for Sharon Stone. Vittorio Cecchi Gori, then in charge of Fiorentina, was standing nearby and said something along the lines of \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the problem? If you score me seven goals, I\xe2\x80\x99ll introduce you to her.\xe2\x80\x99 To which, Santos apparently replied that he reckoned he could get to seven (despite being a defender). Then, per this report, everyone laughs, slaps each other on the back, and the conversation moves on.  This report, for what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, is actually from a week after his arrival, and is carrying the news that Stone has apparently told someone at Eurosport that she\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to meet Santos. I find it a bit odd that this was the earliest reference of the story I could find (if she\xe2\x80\x99s responding then surely it was a story beforehand?), but there you go.  Anyway, it seems that a few days later, the Sunday Mirror ran a report stating that the Stone meeting/seven goals had been a contractual stipulation. La Repubblica made a note of this version in their news-in-briefs, saying that \xe2\x80\x9caccording to the English\xe2\x80\x9d, this had all been written down in black and white. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t actually refute the Mirror\xe2\x80\x99s story (presumably because they had no way of knowing what the paper\xe2\x80\x99s sources were) but the writer seems to me as though he\xe2\x80\x99s writing with one eyebrow raised, opening by suggesting that Santos\xe2\x80\x99s decision to snub Tottenham for Fiorentina had put English noses out of joint. Or at least that\xe2\x80\x99s my reading of it ...\xe2\x80\x9d    TRABZON VILLA? <p>Somebody recently told me that Turkish premier league team Trabzonspor often play in a natty claret and blue combination virtually indistiguishable from the equally natty outfit displayed by Aston Villa,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Dave Baxter. \xe2\x80\x9cSupposedly the former adopted these colours in tribute to the latter. Is this true and, if so, why?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Kind of, is the short answer. The president of Trabzonspor, Abraham Haciosmanoglu, has a slightly different take. His theory is that when the club were formed in 1967 they were so strapped for cash that they contacted a variety of other European clubs to ask if anyone would be able to donate a kit. Villa were thje only team to respond.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen theories on why Trabzonspor wear claret and blue but I\xe2\x80\x99d near heard this, even when we played them in the Uefa Cup in 1994\xe2\x80\x9d said Steve Stride, the former Villa secretary who heard Haciosmanoglu\xe2\x80\x99s story in his role as a Uefa delegate at a Trabzonspor v Apollon Limassol Europa League match last year. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the president assured me it\xe2\x80\x99s a fact.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNottingham Forest\xe2\x80\x99s woeful 4-0 home defeat to Scunthorpe made me think: what\xe2\x80\x99s the worst defeat suffered by a team leading its league?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Jonathan Wood in 2006. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the biggest win by a team at the bottom of the table?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>We had lots of great responses to both parts of this question, but they were all blown emphatically out of the water by Simon Lindberg, who recalled his team Eker\xc3\xb6 IK thumping IFK Vaxholm 24-0 on the last day of the season, despite having already finished last in Sweden\xe2\x80\x99s fourth division. \xe2\x80\x9cVaxholm were also near the bottom, but could no longer get relegated,\xe2\x80\x9d recalls Simon. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir B team needed a win to secure promotion in the reserves league, so they sent their A team to that game and their B team and youth players to play Eker\xc3\xb6. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t even realise until we were 3-0 up after five minutes. For the first time that I know of, both the big Stockholm newspapers had articles about Eker\xc3\xb6.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>But there have been a few impressive showings by rock-bottom teams domestically too, with Iain McCluskey pointing out that Newcastle brought up the rear of the Premiership when Bobby Robson took over in September 1999. Having previously failed to register a win in an admittedly young season, the Toon promptly thrashed Sheffield Wednesday 8-0 at St James\xe2\x80\x99s Park.</p> <p>Possibly more impressive was Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s run of wins in early 1977, as Darren Beach points out. After finding themselves adrift at the foot of the first-division table with just two league wins by late February, they suddenly exploded with three successive big home wins - beating Middlesbrough 4-0, West Brom 6-1 and West Ham 6-0. They eventually finished the season with 11 wins, but still fell one point short of survival.</p> <p>As for top-placed sides taking a tonking, Norwich\xe2\x80\x99s 7-1 defeat at Blackburn in October 1992 was pretty bad, but not the worst. Back in 1939, league leaders Everton capitulated 7-0 to Wolves. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was the only game legendary keeper Ted Sagar missed that season,\xe2\x80\x9d beams Gavin Buckland. \xe2\x80\x9cHis replacement Harry Morton later reflected: \xe2\x80\x98Ted must have known something getting out of that one.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive.</p> Can you help? <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn last week\xe2\x80\x99s Knowledge we learned that in 1987 Chelsea had an \xe2\x80\x98official vegetable\xe2\x80\x99 - celery,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Terry Collins. This gives rise to a question: have any other clubs anywhere had an official vegetable?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFrank Lampard played v Chelsea in Aug 2000, his next appearance against them being his goals scoring appearance for Man City, around 450 club matches later,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Andy Wainwright. \xe2\x80\x9cHas anyone had a greater gap between appearances against a particular team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOn 20 September 2014 Mikkel Andersen finally made his Reading debut against Sheffield Wednesday having joined the club on 26th January 2007,\xe2\x80\x9d begins Will Jones. \xe2\x80\x9cHas another player had to wait so long to make their debut for their new club?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com.</p>'
