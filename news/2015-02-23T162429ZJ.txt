b"James Beattie's special shunting"


b'<p>A CAVERNOUS TANK OF OXYGEN</p> <p>Television, we have been told before, is a dying medium. Fizzling out. Kneeling in tribute to the good lords YouTube, Vine and whatever else the youngsters avoid eye contact in favour of today, only to get Joey Bartoned in a sensitive area when it makes to get up again. Who really needs the telly? Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho decided that he did on Saturday night, dialling up the begetters of football as we know it and requesting a place on the following day\xe2\x80\x99s Goals On Sunday sofa. </p> <p>The tears of joy wept by whoever answered the phone were presumably matched in grief by those who had been looking forward to a few sepia-tinted reminiscences from James Beattie. Out went the ex-Accrington Stanley manager, in came the current Chelsea supremo and with him came a cavernous tank of oxygen to feed a debate that tends to leave you colder than a February night in Stoke. Mourinho cut a brooding figure for the show\xe2\x80\x99s duration but the headline event was a 27-minute tranche in which, virtually uninterrupted, he catalogued the litany of perceived injustices to have gone against Chelsea this season and questioned the standard of refereeing in the Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 prompted by the \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal\xe2\x80\x9d tackle by Ashley Barnes, who may just have thought he was passing the football, which led to Nemanja Matic\xe2\x80\x99s red card on Saturday. </p> <p>The excitement in witnessing this apparent persecution complex unravel was probably dwarfed by that of Sky executives watching the clock to see whether this portion of box-office candy might just overlap with the Spurs v West Ham game on BT Sport. It did not, although if anyone else in the studio had displayed the temerity to challenge one or more of Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s opinions we might have been detained for far longer. Anyway, the damage was done in those 27 minutes on Speakers\xe2\x80\x99 Corner. Any fair points that Mourinho made \xe2\x80\x93 and he has a point about video technology, of course \xe2\x80\x93 tended to be offset by paranoid statements of the \xe2\x80\x9cI would say that another club maybe would have the power to appeal [against Matic\xe2\x80\x99s card]\xe2\x80\x9d variety. </p> <p>He has never been afraid to suggest that others like to cry and it all felt rather thickly laid on here \xe2\x80\x93 almost as if he was installing insulation against the stuttering form shown by his side, who will probably still win the league but are looking particularly leggy in central midfield and up front. What we are faced with now is a question about the whole nature of discussion where referees\xe2\x80\x99 decisions are concerned. They are not permitted to speak in public and nor, usually, are managers allowed to launch into lengthy tirades about their competence. </p> <p>But this 27-minute saturation has done the job of making sure that every angle of every Chelsea game is analysed to the tiniest of degrees, based entirely on a manager\xe2\x80\x99s appetite for giving opinions clothed as fact. How will that impact upon future decisions, for or against? When every Premier League manager agrees to air his views this way, and gets half an hour of his own airtime, perhaps this is OK \xe2\x80\x93 but what we are left with is a feeling that perhaps it would not hurt for referees to be granted five minutes post-match to say what they will, to nobody bar a lone camera and a few awkward silences if necessary. If nothing else, it might be the kind of pre-emptive strike that evens out the playing field a little.</p> <p>In this particular event, Barnes has not been charged by the FA and, whatever you think of that, their slightly tardy five-part Twitter-hosted clarification fell on the wrong side of the fence between \xe2\x80\x9cwell intentioned\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric guff\xe2\x80\x9d. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem at all sufficient in the light of Sky and Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate willingness to let the genie out of the bottle.</p> <p>At least there was one nugget of amusement in a rather depressing episode, when Mourinho offered Sky the chance to go all meta \xe2\x80\x93 offering a commentary on their treatment of Diego Costa. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t do this with every club. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t do this with every player,\xe2\x80\x9d he barbed to his supine interlocutors \xe2\x80\x93 too kind a word in fact. James Beattie would probably have said that they don\xe2\x80\x99t do this to every pundit, either.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY 1 <p>November 2014: \xe2\x80\x9cSteven Pressley is here for the long-term, it is about the Academy, the infrastructure and Steven is part of our long-term plans \xe2\x80\xa6 There is one other point I would like to mention: change. The club is historically short-terminist, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had more managers than you\xe2\x80\x99ve had hot dinners ... but we have to keep a long-term vision\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Coventry City chairman Tim Fisher makes it clear that the club\xe2\x80\x99s manager Steven Pressley will be at the helm for a long time to come.</p> <p>February 2015: \xe2\x80\x9cThanks to Steven for his efforts over the last two years ... Neil MacFarlane and Dave Hockaday have been placed in temporary charge\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 that long-term vision: three months.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY 2 <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99ll be sleeping tonight!! Hazard a guess most of them w*nk players with hearts the size of a pea will be soundo #nopride\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Sacked Peterborough goalkeeping coach James Walker leaves the club with his head held high.</p> FIVER LETTERS     Oh Ian!    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cGot to take issue with Ben Graham (Fiver letters 20 February 2015) and his assertion that George Reilly was the \xe2\x80\x98Peter Crouch of the small shorts era\xe2\x80\x99. No way. The original prototype Peter Crouch, as everyone knows, was Ian Ormondroyd\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Paul Snowdon.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDoes Brendan Rodgers list his religion as Jedi on the national census? I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how else he could claim much influence over Coutinho\xe2\x80\x99s 30+ yard blinder that most would attribute to the player\xe2\x80\x99s skill alone but Rodgers called a \xe2\x80\x98wonderful goal in terms of the system of how we play\xe2\x80\x99. He needs to work on the Jedi mind-trick though, not even the interviewer was fooled by his claim that referee \xe2\x80\x98Kevin Friend was excellent and I think all his decisions were right\xe2\x80\x99, and \xe2\x80\x98these aren\xe2\x80\x99t the droids you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 David Wall.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI remember very little of the Daily Fiver and I am sure that is your intention. I do, however, distinctly remember you saying that Phil Coutinho can\xe2\x80\x99t shoot, or words to that effect. I was in whole hearted agreement with you at the time but have since reviewed my opinion given he has since been able to shoot (emphatically) on at least two occasions. Please can you say that Stewart Downing/Carlton Cole/Mark Noble can\xe2\x80\x99t shoot either\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Colin Cole-Johnson.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
