b'Manuel Pellegrini: only three points will do for Manchester City at Stoke City'


b'<p>Manchester City know failure to win at Stoke City on Wednesday will leave their quest to join Manchester United and Chelsea as the only clubs to have retained the Premier League title in near tatters.</p> <p>This was the frank admittance from Manuel Pellegrini following a dull display which required a late intervention from James Milner to snatch a point against Hull City. The manager\xe2\x80\x99s verdict was echoed by his players: the defending champions are in no man\xe2\x80\x99s land already with Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s lead now seven points and cannot afford more days like this.</p> <p>As Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side finally put away what had been a bogey fixture at Aston Villa, Milner waited until the 92nd minute to fire a 20-yard free-kick past Allan McGregor and cancel out David Meyler\xe2\x80\x99s first-half opener. A sombre Pellegrini admitted anything less than three points at Stoke could be fatal.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWith as many points as we have dropped it will be more difficult, but this time we hope we are going to win against Stoke,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis season I think we have played better away than we have done at home, because we have dropped too many points here at home. So I hope that at Stoke we can score and start winning again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Samir Nasri was as clear. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to wake up and do the job now before it\xe2\x80\x99s too late,\xe2\x80\x9d the Frenchman said. \xe2\x80\x9cChelsea, with no disrespect, are not Liverpool \xe2\x80\x93 who can drop points. They are really solid. We have to catch them as soon as possible if we want to be champions. It will be tough at Stoke, it\xe2\x80\x99s not ideal at 7.45pm on a Wednesday during the winter but we have to win it \xe2\x80\x93 catch up the points we have lost.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Fourteen league matches remain and Milner believes City have to win virtually all. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have got to be pretty faultless between now and the end of the season to get close,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know, more than anyone, you have to keep going to the death and anything can happen.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of City\xe2\x80\x99s home form is correct though the contrast with their away form is not all that stark. At the Etihad there have been seven wins, three draws and two defeats. On the road, seven victories, four draws and a single loss.</p> <p>Before kick-off, the Chilean had talked up last week\xe2\x80\x99s postive display in a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge as a turning point. Yet it now seems February is continuing a dire January in which only one league victory was claimed, the 3-2 win over Sunderland on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, and the club was knocked out of the FA Cup by Middlesbrough.</p> <p>Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe were a very good team against Chelsea and played well, but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t create enough chances. We are not creating space against teams who defend with eight or nine players.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not criticising them [the opposition]. We have to try to find a solution in changing our style or trying to do different things.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>At the same juncture last season City had 53 points, four better than today, and 68 goals, 21 more than now. Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 and the new \xc2\xa326m signing, Wilfried Bony, should help but they will not be available for Stoke because of Ivory Coast\xe2\x80\x99s Africa Cup of Nations final against Ghana .</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey play on Sunday, they must return here on Monday, it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy for them to just come, arrive and play so many games in just a few days,\xe2\x80\x9d Pelegrini said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think this problem is a problem of one name. This is a team with great players and at the moment we must try to find which ones of them can help resolve the problem.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>For Steve Bruce\xe2\x80\x99s Hull this fine draw ended a run of four straight defeats. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes people respond to a bollocking and sometimes people respond to an arm around the shoulder and being reassured that they\xe2\x80\x99re good players,\xe2\x80\x9d the manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t keep hitting people with sticks all the time because eventually they get tired of it and down tools. However, I think they all realise that last week they were nowhere near where they should be and they\xe2\x80\x99re honest enough to accept that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of the 3-0 capitulation at Newcastle United. \xe2\x80\x9cWe brought a few players back today \xe2\x80\x93 [Paul] McShane and Alex [Bruce] in particular alongside [Michael] Dawson were all terrific.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Man of the match David Meyler (Hull City)</p>'
