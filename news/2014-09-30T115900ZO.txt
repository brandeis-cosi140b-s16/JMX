b'Olivier Giroud signs two-year contract extension at Arsenal despite injury'


b'<p>Olivier Giroud has signed a two-year extension to his current Arsenal contract. The French striker, currently recovering from surgery on a broken left tibia, is expected to be out of action until at least the end of December but has committed his future to the north London club until 2018.</p> <p>Giroud\xe2\x80\x99s absence is one of several being keenly felt by Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger, although the signing of Danny Welbeck from Manchester United late in the summer transfer window could provide stern competition for the Frenchman when he returns.</p> <p>Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s side will be without Aaron Ramsey for at least a month with a hamstring injury sustained in last Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s 1-1 draw against Spurs. Mikel Arteta, meanwhile, is expected to be out for three weeks with a calf strain.</p> <p>The manager has had brighter news regarding Jack Wilshere\xe2\x80\x99s prospects after he turned his ankle in a challenge with Danny Rose during the north London derby, and hopes the England midfielder will be able to feature next weekend against Premier League leaders Chelsea. Despite initial fears he is thought to have an outside chance of figuring in Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League group game against Galatasaray.</p>'
