b'<p>By the end they had sustained a couple of worrying casualties but a tense night on Teesside left Aitor Karanka\xe2\x80\x99s Middlesbrough celebrating three potentially invaluable points as Wolves\xe2\x80\x99 play-off hopes hit a wall. Karanka could have done without the second-half injuries which deprived his side of a pair of key individuals in Jonathan Woodgate and Albert Adomah, but Boro remain in touching distance of the Premier League.</p> <p>Early goals from Jelle Vossen and the excellent Patrick Bamford left them third, one point behind second-placed Norwich, two short of Bournemouth and two ahead of Watford, who visit Nottingham Forest on Wednesday evening.</p> <p>Although four will not go into two, Boro\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Norwich on Friday night could go a long way towards determining the automatic promotion places. Three points outside the top six Wolves, meanwhile, were left with nothing to show for a second-half renaissance during which it was sometimes difficult to comprehend they were in League One this time last year.</p> <p>The Chelsea loanee Bamford \xe2\x80\x93 described by Karanka as \xe2\x80\x9camazing\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 not only scored himself but created Vossen\xe2\x80\x99s goal. \xe2\x80\x9cFor me he\xe2\x80\x99s the best young player in this league,\xe2\x80\x9d added Boro\xe2\x80\x99s manager who will assess the damage to the hamstrung Woodgate and Adomah on Wednesday.</p> <p>As dusk descended on the Riverside Boro enjoyed the brightest of beginnings. Only three minutes had passed when Vossen\xe2\x80\x99s right-footed shot furnished them with a psychologically helpful lead.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you worry, we\xe2\x80\x99re going up,\xe2\x80\x9d chorused the home fans after a long ball confounded the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 defence, permitting Bamford to square for Vossen before getting in on the scoring act himself.</p> <p>The second goal featured a superb left-footed shot directed into the bottom corner after Bamford was cleverly cued up by Tomas Kalas. It was his 19th goal of a wonderful season and seemed to stun a Wolves side still struggling to escape their own half.</p> <p>With Woodgate heading wide and Adomah curling a shot against the bar Kenny Jackett\xe2\x80\x99s team looked increasingly bewildered. Indeed Richard Stearman\xe2\x80\x99s booking for a nasty, rather desperate foul on Bamford appeared emblematic of the visiting frustration as Karanka\xe2\x80\x99s players showed off some stellar passing to go with their subtle movement.</p> <p>With Benik Afobe thoroughly subdued, first-half visiting chances were few and far between although Rajiv van La Parra and Bakary Sako both had their moments. Yet assured as Ben Gibson and the impressively elegant Woodgate were proving in the home defence, Karanka\xe2\x80\x99s nervous, slightly hyperactive, pacing of his technical area betrayed a certain anxiety.</p> <p>As half-time approached Wolves were finally stringing a few passes together as they belatedly began getting to grips with a game that had initially not so much threatened to run away from them as to career out of their control.</p> <p>Everything changed when Sako connected with Dave Edwards\xe2\x80\x99s second-half cross and Dimi Konstantopoulos proved powerless to repel his left-footed shot. With the news that Norwich had scored at Leeds filtering through, the evening assumed a slightly edgy air. The sight of the ever fragile Woodgate hobbling off \xe2\x80\x93 to a deserved ovation \xe2\x80\x93 hardly served as a relaxant.</p> <p>Indeed despite still being very much on top at this stage, Boro very nearly came undone as Wolves countered, La Parra lashing the ball against the bar following Golbourne\xe2\x80\x99s cross. The sense that fortune was suddenly frowning on the home side mounted when Adomah was forced off. Almost imperceptibly, the game had turned. Although Bamford\xe2\x80\x99s shot hit the bar at the death, Karanka\xe2\x80\x99s players were forced into some last ditch defending.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMiddlesbrough are ruthless,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jackett. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re very, very good and probably the best side in this division. It was their night and Bamford \xe2\x80\x93 who is very good \xe2\x80\x93 was a handful but we fought back and showed a lot of spirit, a lot of character. The opportunity to reach the play-offs is still there.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
