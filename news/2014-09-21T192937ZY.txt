b'Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s meaty display for City does not disguise loss of appetite | Barney Ronay'


b'<p>Frank Lampard\xe2\x80\x99s late equaliser at the Etihad Stadium may have added a dash of operetta at the end of this gruelling full-body collision of a draw. But beneath the headline drama, and indeed City\xe2\x80\x99s show of resolve in coming from behind having been reduced to 10 men, this was a pachydermic Premier League title-grapple, a match that resembled at times a super-heavyweight judo bout; and at its more low pressure moments the sporting equivalent of a half-speed wrestle in a pub carvery car park.</p> <p>City will take heart from their point here, having lost Pablo Zabaleta after 65 minutes to a second yellow card, the last for a heavy tackle on Diego Costa that sparked an unedifying round of soft-touch jostling and led straight into Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle\xe2\x80\x99s goal from Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s first shot of the match. And yet, for all their undoubted spirit City have now gone four weeks without a win after another game in which one of the main issues in City\xe2\x80\x99s recent run of middling results, Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s strangely flat, strangely absent run of form, was only partially answered.</p> <p>Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s thick blue line was hardly outplayed here, but at times the champions simply looked short of devil, a high-pressure unit without the change of pace, that sudden spike of incision; which was once, of course, Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s own speciality.</p> <p>Ah, Yaya. City\xe2\x80\x99s midfield colossus did not have a bad game. In many ways this was even a return to form. His passing was crisp in the first half and he had as many touches as any other central player. If there was a slight lack of spark then there was undoubtedly a little more presence from Tour\xc3\xa9, for whom an absent performance in Munich added to a general sense of low-throttle coasting \xe2\x80\x93 Tour\xc3\xa9 hasn\xe2\x80\x99t scored a goal for City since April \xe2\x80\x93 and some slightly gleeful revisionism too. There is undoubtedly a part of English football that seems always ready to debunk the Tour\xc3\xa9 supremacy, uneasy with the garlands handed out to this strolling, angular, occasionally soft-touch giant of the recent Premier league years.</p>           Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho and Manuel Pellegrini are both happy to settle for a point following Man City\xe2\x80\x99s 1-1 draw with Chelsea    <p>The idea of Tour\xc3\xa9 as a flat-track bully runs out of steam pretty quickly confronted with a showreel of his role in City\xe2\x80\x99s defining moments of the last three years (and just such a showreel was playing on the big screen at the Etihad before the kick-off). And yet he is 31 years old, a central cog in what is an undeniably a venerable team. Although lining up at a sunlit Etihad, what was most noticeable was the sheer scale of City\xe2\x80\x99s team who seemed briefly to blot out the sun as they bunched together for the pre-match handshakes. Eliaquim Mangala and Vincent Kompany may or may not end up going down in the annals of great centre-back pairings. But if all else fails, they undoubtedly have a future as a world-class firm of piano removers.</p> <p>Tour\xc3\xa9 and Fernandinho formed a dual midfield fulcrum behind James Milner and David Silva on the flanks, providing a well-shielded pocket from which Tour\xc3\xa9 played several fine long diagonal passes in the opening 15 minutes, performing his often underrated kingsized-metronome role. After which the match settled down into a concussive affair. One of the biggest cheers of the first half came after 27 minutes when Tour\xc3\xa9 and Nemanja Matic found themselves face to face near the touchline and City\xe2\x80\x99s midfield totem embarked not so much on a dribble down the wing as a 15-metre driving maul, a crash-tackling, chest-bumping, two-man tug of war that had half the Colin Bell stand on its feet.</p> <p>It is easy enough to enjoy the meaty pleasures of this kind of high-stakes Premier League muscle-football. Albeit it was perhaps also easy to see why the two best teams in England had both struggled a little against classy European opposition in midweek week (albeit City against one of world football\xe2\x80\x99s current superpowers). In between the unbowed muscularity there were misplaced passes, periods of slow possession, and in City\xe2\x80\x99s case a lack of speed and mobility generally. As half-time approached Tour\xc3\xa9 was booked for simply falling over on top of Willian as he ferreted off over the halfway line, the kind of full-body bellyflop with which a middle-aged community support officer might bring down some whippet-like teenage graffiti suspect.</p> <p>As a muscular first half elided into an equally muscular second half, the game finally opened up into its decisive last quarter: the first goal a victory for Costa\xe2\x80\x99s abrasive presence, his turn, spin and jink sparking a fine six-man move; the second for City\xe2\x80\x99s class and enduring warrior spirit. Chelsea were undeniably, even at times gloriously compact, a genuinely grudging Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho away performance that might have taken all three points.</p> <p>There will still be plenty for Pellegrini to consider behind his understandable \xe2\x80\x93 if largely unjustified \xe2\x80\x93 complaints about the referee. City are a high-class team with a tangible sense of spirit but it has been several years since they signed a front player who has actually had any concerted impact on the first team; which remains in essence Vincent Kompany, Tour\xc3\xa9, David Silva, Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero and seven high-class place-men. Oh, to be burdened with such grand, pachydermic talents: but City, and Tour\xc3\xa9, still look in need of an extra spring to go with their undoubted muscle.</p>'
