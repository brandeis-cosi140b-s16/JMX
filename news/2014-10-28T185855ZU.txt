b"USMNT's DeAndre Yedlin goes global: 'I know that I can perform'"


b'<p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Originally published in Eight By Eight magazine</p> <p>The quotation \xe2\x80\x9cAlways Remember the Beginning\xe2\x80\x9d graces DeAndre Yedlin\xe2\x80\x99s Twitter profile. For the breakout American star of the 2014 World Cup, it\xe2\x80\x99s a daily reminder \xe2\x80\x9cto stay humble\xe2\x80\x9d as expectations for his career steadily rise. Though one might expect the attention to inflate Yedlin\xe2\x80\x99s ego, the 21-year-old fullback believes humility to be a requisite component of success. \xe2\x80\x9cOne thing I always remind myself of is that there are always younger players in better leagues doing better things than I\xe2\x80\x99m doing right now,\xe2\x80\x9d Yedlin told Eight by Eight. \xe2\x80\x9cSo if I\xe2\x80\x99m not there, I need to get there. </p> <p>For a footballer trying to get there, there\xe2\x80\x99s no greater showcase than the World Cup, and in Brazil, Yedlin impressed on world football\xe2\x80\x99s biggest stage. Making three substitute appearances for J\xc3\xbcrgen Klinsmann\xe2\x80\x99s Yanks, the Seattle-born speedster injected confidence and pace into an often bunkered American team. In his final match against Belgium, Yedlin faced a chilling assignment: enter the match cold and mark Chelsea star Eden Hazard. \xe2\x80\x9cI just heard J\xc3\xbcrgen say, \xe2\x80\x98Get up, start moving a little bit\xe2\x80\x94you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go in right now,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Yedlin recalled. Despite the pressure, Yedlin seemed to have freon pulsing through his veins, stifling Hazard and sparking a listless American attack to life. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of time to think about what was going on,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cI just had to go in, be confident, and shut down Hazard.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Yedlin\xe2\x80\x99s quiet, humble confidence isn\xe2\x80\x99t masking a budding ego. Unlike other self-aggrandizing athletes, Yedlin doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to tell others that he\xe2\x80\x99s good; he knows that he is. For his college coach Caleb Porter, it was Yedlin\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfearlessness, mixed with a positive attitude, and a refreshing level of na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x9d that allowed him to leap from college to Major League Soccer to the World Cup before he could legally buy a drink. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think he thinks too much about the magnitude of the things that he\xe2\x80\x99s doing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porter. That might be the young player\xe2\x80\x99s most useful quality. </p> <p>But for football fans in the US yearning for future World Cup glory, Yedlin has come to represent the first fruit of a reform program set in motion a decade ago to remake player development in the US. Seeking to redress a backwards youth system that prioritized winning trophies over creating professional players, MLS and US Soccer both invested heavily to professionalize elite player development in the past decade. Yedlin\xe2\x80\x99s youth career touched every component of those reforms, and if expectations are met, there will be more players like Yedlin flooding MLS sides and US Soccer rosters ahead of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. With a move to Tottenham Hotspur FC scheduled in 2015, Yedlin has become the ideal poster boy for the Klinsmann regime, and if Klinsmann has his way, more young American talent will soon join Yedlin, parachuting into European stadiums and trying to take their game to \xe2\x80\x9canother level,\xe2\x80\x9d as Klinsmann demands.</p> \xe2\x80\x98He needed to be challenged a little bit more\xe2\x80\x99 <p>Before DeAndre Yedlin\xe2\x80\x99s 12th birthday, the budding footballer had already featured for a dizzying array of Seattle youth clubs, including the West Seattle Magic, Emerald City Football Club, and the Northwest Nationals Soccer Club. Some parents criticized Yedlin\xe2\x80\x99s constant jersey swapping, but Dylan Walton-Yedlin, his uncle, contends that the family \xe2\x80\x9cjust wanted to do what was best\xe2\x80\x9d for Yedlin\xe2\x80\x99s development, and in Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s competitive marketplace for youth football talent, they were able to seek out the best coaching and training environment. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople might have gotten the impression he was some kind of a mercenary,\xe2\x80\x9d recalled Walton-Yedlin. \xe2\x80\x9cI think he just needed to be challenged a little bit more.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The youth football marketplace that Yedlin competed in emerged in the late 20th century as the sport exploded across the US. With more and more American parents shuttling their kids from pitch to pitch every weekend, top youth clubs grew like weeds to meet the growing demand for a sport that lacked infrastructure. In this competitive environment, clubs were forced to compete for top players, and local youth clubs grew into multimillion-dollar nonprofit organizations capable of paying technical directors six-figure salaries. As professional coaches replaced parent volunteers, the days of halftime orange slices were over for elite American players.</p> <p>In Europe, clubs like Ajax Amsterdam and FC Barcelona finance their extensive academies with first-team revenues, and players participate for free, but in North America those costs often fall to parents who dole out wads of cash to pay for coaches, travel, field space, uniforms, and equipment. \xe2\x80\x9cI 100% agree we should make soccer free,\xe2\x80\x9d argued TSN commentator Jason de Vos, a former Canadian international and youth-club technical director in Toronto. \xe2\x80\x9cBut getting there is a really, really difficult process.\xe2\x80\x9d De Vos\xe2\x80\x99s view is shared by many: No one likes pay-to-play programs, but without them, football in the US would be worse off.</p> <p>In Seattle, Yedlin continued to hop from club to club, landing at Crossfire Premier Soccer Club, one of the Pacific Northwest\xe2\x80\x99s top programs. \xe2\x80\x9cCrossfire was kind of that premier team that everybody in the state knew,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yedlin. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody wanted to play for them.\xe2\x80\x9d As an attacking winger, Yedlin had pace and skill that propelled him onto state teams and into national team camps.</p> <p>Yedlin\xe2\x80\x99s ability to see a career in professional football would not have been possible if he had been born in the US a decade earlier. \xe2\x80\x9cGrowing up, I honestly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even thinking about playing college soccer,\xe2\x80\x9d recalled Ali Curtis, a former MLS player and senior director of player relations and competition for MLS, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so different now.\xe2\x80\x9d The landscape began to shift with the 1994 World Cup and the birth of MLS in 1996, and elite player development got a jump start two years later when US Soccer and Nike devised Project 2010, a plan to develop a generation of American talent capable of winning the 2010 World Cup. Nike\xe2\x80\x99s initial investment financed the US Soccer under-17 residential academy in Bradenton, Florida. in 1998, nurturing a cohort of players that included future national team stars Landon Donovan, DaMarcus Beasley, and Kyle Beckerman. For US Soccer director of scouting Tony Lepore, Project 2010 provided a \xe2\x80\x9cthorough investigation of where we were at that time,\xe2\x80\x9d but the reform process had only just begun.</p> <p>Just one residential academy could not produce a big enough player pool to challenge for a World Cup title, so US Soccer launched the Development Academy in 2007, expanding the Bradenton model to the premier MLS youth teams and amateur youth clubs around the United States\xe2\x80\x94like Yedlin\xe2\x80\x99s Crossfire. According to Lepore, US Soccer recognized that elite players and families \xe2\x80\x9cwere stretched too thin,\xe2\x80\x9d playing too many games against poor competition. Studying the best developmental practices around the world, US Soccer set in motion a philosophy that placed \xe2\x80\x9cdevelopment before results\xe2\x80\x9d and identified 63 youth clubs in major markets to join the Development Academy. \xe2\x80\x9cThe idea was that one club develops a player,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lepore. \xe2\x80\x9cWe wanted to empower the clubs.\xe2\x80\x9d While Project 2010 nurtured the growth of one team, the Development Academy targeted approximately 4,000 players. For de Vos, the thinking was simple: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s better to teach a man to fish than to give him a fish.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As a high school player, Yedlin earned a spot on Crossfire\xe2\x80\x99s Development Academy team, which competed against other Development Academy clubs from Northern California to the rainy climes of the Pacific Northwest. As a Development Academy club, Crossfire now had to train at least four times a week, and players competed only in meaningful games against strong competition. \xe2\x80\x9cYou really felt you were professional,\xe2\x80\x9d recalled Yedlin. With matches in California and tournaments around the country, Yedlin\xe2\x80\x99s team traveled often, and his grandparents, Ira Yedlin and Vickie Walton, happily paid for the privilege. </p> <p>Born on July 9, 1993, in Seattle, DeAndre Yedlin arrived at a troubling time for his parents. With his biological father absent and soon to be incarcerated, his mother, Rebecca Yedlin, moved in with her parents for support. Around her son\xe2\x80\x99s first birthday, Rebecca recognized that she was not prepared to raise DeAndre on her own and relinquished formal custody of her son to her parents. Until he went to college, Yedlin lived with them and his uncle, who is nine years older.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI grew up with very strong family support,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yedlin. \xe2\x80\x9cMy grandparents raised me, and my uncle sort of played that father-figure role in my life.\xe2\x80\x9d For Walton-Yedlin, much of the support came from his mother, Yedlin\xe2\x80\x99s grandmother. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has a really good relationship with his biological mother,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Walton-Yedlin, \xe2\x80\x9cBut still, he knows, we all know\xe2\x80\x9d that his grandmother raised him. </p> <p>Though all remember Yedlin as a happy child, he quietly grappled with his family situation. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a kid, that can be a little bit tough to understand,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained, recalling how he struggled to comprehend \xe2\x80\x9cwhy my mom wasn\xe2\x80\x99t raising me, why my dad was in jail.\xe2\x80\x9d Even as the post\xe2\x80\x93World Cup spotlight shines on him, Yedlin remains reflective and even-keeled. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, there\xe2\x80\x99s still parts of it that I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to figure out,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>Yedlin\xe2\x80\x99s grandparents provided the financial and emotional support that has enabled him to reach his peak potential. \xe2\x80\x9cIt could be practice, games, traveling to Lancaster, Calif., or anywhere, and they would be there, and that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yedlin\xe2\x80\x99s Crossfire coach Sean Henderson. Walton-Yedlin said, \xe2\x80\x9cI could count on one hand how many athletic events they missed, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be in the thousands now.\xe2\x80\x9d As an expression of gratitude to his grandparents, Yedlin plans to send them to India this summer to visit the Taj Mahal, a lifelong dream of his grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s.</p> <p>As a senior in high school, Yedlin made one final leap, leaving Crossfire for the Seattle Sounders FC Academy, which also competed in the Development Academy. \xe2\x80\x9cIt took a lot of the financial stress off my grandparents,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yedlin. (The Sounders Academy was free for players. Crossfire has recently made its Development Academy teams free too.) The move also allowed Yedlin to sign directly with the Seattle Sounders as a \xe2\x80\x9chomegrown\xe2\x80\x9d player when he was ready for the rigors of professional soccer. </p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI look at youth development the way I look at the tech industry,\xe2\x80\x9d said Curtis of MLS. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see the advances that have been made in the last five years, and those advances have arguably had a greater impact than the advances made in last the last 50 years. And I expect the advances and changes made in the next five years will have a similar effect.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> \xe2\x80\x98A potential standout\xe2\x80\x99 <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s strange to think of DeAndre Yedlin as a late bloomer, since he featured in a World Cup as a 20-year-old, but Yedlin \xe2\x80\x9cwas very much under the radar\xe2\x80\x9d entering college, said Caleb Porter, Yedlin\xe2\x80\x99s coach at the University of Akron. Although Yedlin attended several US youth national team camps, he never featured regularly, and many college coaches were unsure how his skill set would translate to the collegiate level. He was projected to be a winger, and they wondered if he had the technical skill, tenacity, and size to succeed as an attacker, but Porter had a different idea.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI immediately saw a potential standout right back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porter, the current coach of the Portland Timbers. \xe2\x80\x9cI get kids all the time that are forwards who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be forwards, so it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty normal to take a kid out of position.\xe2\x80\x9d In Yedlin, Porter envisioned a modern attacking fullback in the mold of Dani Alves.</p> <p>For players who have not been a part of US youth national teams and are not yet ready to leap into the professional game, college football can be an important (and often the only) developmental path. At the 2014 World Cup, 11 of the 23 players on Klinsmann\xe2\x80\x99s squad spent time playing in college, including captain Clint Dempsey who, like Yedlin, was also an unheralded player when he entered Furman University in South Carolina. \xe2\x80\x9cYou play real games in front of real crowds,\xe2\x80\x9d said University of Maryland head coach Sasho Cirovski. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t get that at the academy level or in reserve-team soccer.\xe2\x80\x9d Though some have advocated phasing college soccer out of elite development, Cirovski sees the college game as the \xe2\x80\x9cglue\xe2\x80\x9d within the American development system.</p> <p>Yedlin credits Porter for his development into a player who was ready for the professional leagues. \xe2\x80\x9cThere were times when I absolutely hated him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yedlin. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seemed like during my freshman year, he\xe2\x80\x99d always be getting on me.\xe2\x80\x9d But Porter\xe2\x80\x99s exacting standards forced Yedlin to change the way he evaluated his own play. Porter \xe2\x80\x9cmade me mentally stronger and judge myself a little bit harder, which is something that I needed,\xe2\x80\x9d Yedlin explained.</p> <p>After two years with Porter at Akron, Yedlin faced another choice: return to Ohio and finish out his collegiate career or accept a contract offer from his hometown club to become the Seattle Sounders\xe2\x80\x99 first \xe2\x80\x9chomegrown\xe2\x80\x9d player in 2013. Porter advised Yedlin, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to do this, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a step up. You\xe2\x80\x99re thrown into this environment where it\xe2\x80\x99s money and it\xe2\x80\x99s business, and mentally you have to be ready for it.\xe2\x80\x9d At 19, DeAndre Yedlin was ready for both the glamour and glare of being a professional.</p> \xe2\x80\x98Who the hell does this kid think he is?\xe2\x80\x99 <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWho the hell does this kid think he is with this big blond mohawk,\xe2\x80\x9d remembered Eddie Johnson, a teammate of Yedlin\xe2\x80\x99s on the Sounders. Yedlin\xe2\x80\x99s hair \xe2\x80\x93 a bleached mohawk bold enough to make David Beckham blush \xe2\x80\x93 colored many first impressions of the young right back. On a less humble, less well liked player, the attention-grabbing hairstyle might not have been tolerated. But for Johnson, Yedlin\xe2\x80\x99s quiet humility silenced any initial misgivings. Yedlin came to Seattle to play, not to be a distraction. \xe2\x80\x9cTo have that hairstyle you have to have a certain amount of confidence,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yedlin. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I have kind of have the same mind-set that Kanye West has. He just likes to do his thing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In his first season with the Sounders, Yedlin was not slated to start, but when the first-choice right back went down injured, Yedlin slotted into the starting 11 and never relinquished the position, becoming an MLS All-Star in the process. His play (and hair) attracted the attention of Klinsmann, who inquired about the young right back\xe2\x80\x99s skill and character with the Sounders\xe2\x80\x99 head coach Sigi Schmid, who told Klinsmann to ignore the loud hairstyles: DeAndre Yedlin was a player. Klinsmann invited Yedlin to the annual US Soccer January camp, where the premier MLS talent gathers every off-season to work with the national team. In January 2014, the camp had an added incentive: impress here and earn a spot in Brazil. For Johnson, who moved to DC United as a striker and was a fellow January camp participant, Yedlin was \xe2\x80\x9cone of the best players in the camp.\xe2\x80\x9d In May, Klinsmann surprisingly named Yedlin to the 23-man roster for Brazil, a decision that would have generated more buzz if not for the high-profile omission of Landon Donovan. In Brazil, Yedlin\xe2\x80\x99s pace and attacking prowess were on display for the best clubs in Europe, and teams from all over the continent were interested in his services after the World Cup.</p> <p>After weeks of rumors, Yedlin chose Tottenham and will transfer in 2015. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a big fan of the style of play that Pochettino has installed in that team,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yedlin. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it fits my style very well.\xe2\x80\x9d To start at right back for Spurs, Yedlin will have to supplant both Kyle Walker and rising English star Eric Dier. While a loan to another club in England or Europe is possible, much of that depends on Yedlin\xe2\x80\x99s passport situation, as he tries to secure a Latvian passport through his mother\xe2\x80\x99s family. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly what [Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s] plans are right now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Yedlin, but \xe2\x80\x9cthey want me to come in and battle for a spot.\xe2\x80\x9d Which is precisely what Yedlin wants to do. </p> <p>Some players might be dismayed by the competition at Spurs, but the test entices Yedlin. \xe2\x80\x9cI almost got too comfortable in Seattle,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to challenge myself and see what I have and prove to other people and prove to myself.\xe2\x80\x9d Yedlin speaks of his talent as if he possesses a potential that only increased competition can unlock.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe mind is very powerful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porter. \xe2\x80\x9cIt can either hurt you or help you. Yedlin doesn\xe2\x80\x99t worry about what could go wrong. He just goes and plays.\xe2\x80\x9d Somewhere, Klinsmann is smiling.</p> <p>To make it in Europe, Yedlin will need to improve the underdeveloped areas of his game. Yedlin \xe2\x80\x9cstill needs work defensively,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porter, a sentiment echoed by many who believe he relies too much on natural speed to cover for defensive lapses. If Yedlin can do so, he could become, according to Sounders teammate Brad Evans, \xe2\x80\x9cthe best right back the United States has seen since Steve Cherundolo.\xe2\x80\x9d But it won\xe2\x80\x99t be easy in the unforgiving environment that Europe provides. Former Sounder Eddie Johnson advised, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s different in Europe. You\xe2\x80\x99re not just one of the five or six best players within the entire team. Everyone is as good as you. They can always buy new players, so you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be consistent.\xe2\x80\x9d </p> <p>The cutthroat nature of football abroad has caused many US national team stars to opt against a European odyssey. \xe2\x80\x9cYou glorify things a little bit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sounders midfielder Brad Evans, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know you want to play for Liverpool, but at the end of the day, most Americans are not playing at the biggest clubs in Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d As MLS shells out major-league money to lure the best American talent, like Michael Bradley, Clint Dempsey, and Jermaine Jones, to North America, choosing to play in Europe is more of a competitive decision than a financial one. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe that\xe2\x80\x99s not what the national team coach wants to hear,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded Evans, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I think it\xe2\x80\x99s quality of life that matters.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Klinsmann is certainly hoping to see Yedlin succeed. Since taking over as national team manager in 2011, he has constantly urged the best American players to compete in Europe \xe2\x80\x93 only to see many return to MLS. Klinsmann hopes that Yedlin will buck the trend, and if the past is any indication for what Yedlin\xe2\x80\x99s future will hold, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear how he will perform: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got the innate ability to make jumps from level to level,\xe2\x80\x9d said Porter. Whether moving from Crossfire to the Sounders Academy or from the Seattle Sounders to the US national team, Yedlin credits his constant success to his confidence. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I just have the mentality that I\xe2\x80\x99m always hungry,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cEven if it is a high level, once I get comfortable and I get comfortable with myself, I know that I can perform.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Rooney.
