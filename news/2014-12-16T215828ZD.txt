b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho is closing in on a sixth major trophy that would end the drought of his second Chelsea tenure. This was a regulation win though the manager was concerned at the time it took the stretcher-bearers to reach a stricken Kurt Zouma near the end of the first half.</p> <p>After colliding with Petr Cech from a Derby County corner the French defender was left on the turf. As the stretcher was called for, the bearers dawdled so first Mourinho implored them to hurry, then Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas and C\xc3\xa9sar Azpilicueta followed their manager\xe2\x80\x99s lead, and after a long delay Zouma was finally taken away for treatment and Branislav Ivanovic came on to replace him.</p> <p>Asked if this had frustrated him, Mourinho said: \xe2\x80\x9cYeah. The players\xe2\x80\x99 body language [indicated] there was some trouble but I had no idea what was going on because of the distance and they [the stretcher-bearers] were coming \xe2\x80\x93 walking. Then I was informed that this was the direction they have. They can\xe2\x80\x99t run, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if the information was right but I think they can\xe2\x80\x99t run.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf he is injured and the body language of the players is that he had to go off you don\xe2\x80\x99t know the dimension. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if it was a knee, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I had no idea at the time \xe2\x80\x93 I think the people with the stretcher want to help but if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t run I have to believe that is the instruction they have.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho is confident the 20-year-old should recover quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is fine. We don\xe2\x80\x99t think he needs hospital treatment. He was a bit dizzy and he had some blood in his mouth because of a cut,\xe2\x80\x9d said the manager. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has gone for some exams with the docs. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be available for Monday [away to Stoke City]. I thought the collision was a punch, but it was Petr\xe2\x80\x99s head.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s passage to the semi-finals next month was not completely smooth after Derby briefly threatened a comeback with Craig Bryson\xe2\x80\x99s 71st-minute goal that made it 2-1. But the home support\xe2\x80\x99s joy soon faded when the Chelsea substitute Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my raced on to a pass and Jake Buxton fouled the forward. After consulting the assistant, Jonathan Moss showed the red card, the referee judging Buxton to be the last man.</p> <p>While Mourinho claimed \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t see\xe2\x80\x9d, Steve McClaren was in no doubt there had been an injustice. \xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely [it was wrong]. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it quite a few times and I doubt that would have been given in the middle of the park. We believe it\xe2\x80\x99s wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d said Derby\xe2\x80\x99s manager.</p> <p>While McClaren said he was considering an appeal \xe2\x80\x93 Buxton faces a two-game ban as he has been sent off once before this season \xe2\x80\x93 within minutes of the defender\xe2\x80\x99s departure Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle made it 3-1 to keep Mourinho on course to claim the same cup that began a supremely successful first spell in charge at Chelsea.</p> <p>Mourinho had indicated how seriously he was taking the tie in his selection. The Portuguese made five changes from the team that beat Hull City 2-0 at Stamford Bridge on Saturday but still fielded a powerful starting XI. Didier Drogba, Azpilicueta, Zouma, Sch\xc3\xbcrrle and F\xc3\xa0bregas came into a team that also included the captain John Terry, Cech, Mikel John Obi, Eden Hazard, Filipe Lu\xc3\xads and Nemanja Matic. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we were not professional we would lose, I knew that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho.</p> <p>The match began slowly: there was a corner for the visitors, a couple of speculative forays downfield for Derby, and a foul on Matic by Bryson near the centre circle.</p> <p>The quicker brains and feet of F\xc3\xa0bregas and Sch\xc3\xbcrrle appeared the greatest threat to Derby\xe2\x80\x99s defence, the attacking-midfield duo attacking primarily through central areas and along the left.</p> <p>It was from this flank that Chelsea opened the scoring. F\xc3\xa0bregas pinged the ball to Hazard, who cut in from the left across Derby\xe2\x80\x99s area then reversed a smart shot that wrong-footed Lee Grant and beat the goalkeeper to his right.</p> <p>Eleven minutes into the second half Lu\xc3\xads doubled the lead with his first goal for Chelsea, a sweetly curving 25-yard free-kick.</p> <p>Derby\xe2\x80\x99s brief rally failed to disturb Chelsea, who deservedly eased through. Apart from the injury to Zouma, Drogba took a knock to an ankle, but Mourinho said: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a strong guy with a strong mentality. I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be OK.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea will be strong contenders in all four main competitions \xe2\x80\x93 they face Watford at home in the FA third-round in January \xe2\x80\x93 but Mourinho scoffed at talk of a quadruple.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNo \xe2\x80\x93 we don\xe2\x80\x99t speak about that. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to win on Monday. We go match by match. We don\xe2\x80\x99t choose competitions or matches. The next match is the most important thing. We go like this. The players tonight showed that attitude by playing a very professional game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Kurt Zouma clashes heads with Petr Cech whilst under pressure from Derby\xe2\x80\x99s Richard Keogh.
