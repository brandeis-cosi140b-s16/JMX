b'Arsenal v Manchester City: match preview'


b'<p>Arsenal coasted to victory in the Community Shield against City but this promises to be an altogether more intense occasion. For both clubs it is the precursor to big midweek Champions League ties in Germany while for City, the kicker at the end of the week is provided by the visit of Chelsea. Victory in the early kick-off would represent a tonic, particularly, one feels, for Arsenal, whose record against top-four finishers in the last few seasons has been poor.
