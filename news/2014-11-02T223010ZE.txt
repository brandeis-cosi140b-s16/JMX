b'Everton\xe2\x80\x99s Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez vexed after Garry Monk changes Swansea habit'


b'<p>Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez could not disguise his irritation at being short-changed at Goodison Park. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was like going into the cinema expecting to see an outstanding film and you don\xe2\x80\x99t get it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of Everton\xe2\x80\x99s tepid goalless draw with Swansea City. A fair analysis, although the frequency of flops at home this season highlights a deeper problem for the Spaniard.</p> <p>Saturday was an exception to most Goodison productions in fairness; a game devoid of entertainment and imagination even after the visitors were reduced to 10 men following Jonjo Shelvey\xe2\x80\x99s daft dismissal. Along with Arsenal, Chelsea and Crystal Palace, however, Swansea departed undefeated.</p> <p>A team of Everton\xe2\x80\x99s pre-season intent and options, with Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o, Romelu Lukaku, Ross Barkley, Aiden McGeady and Steven Naismith deployed to minimal effect against a resilient Swansea defence, has little excuse for a return of one win from five Premier League home games.</p> <p>Mart\xc3\xadnez claimed surprise at Garry Monk\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to sacrifice the flowing, creative football for which Swansea are renowned for a disciplined rearguard action, an approach that may have yielded three points had Wilfried Bony converted a clear early chance or Antol\xc3\xadn Alcaraz been penalised for a blatant handball inside the Everton area. Monk should take the slight as a compliment.</p> <p>Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s two banks of four comfortably nullified Everton and their afternoon developed into one of mounting frustration far too easily. Lukaku\xe2\x80\x99s late cameo, that included inadvertently diverting shots from Leighton Baines and Steven Pienaar wide and just failing to connect with Eto\xe2\x80\x99o\xe2\x80\x99s inviting cross in the final seconds, encapsulated the home side\xe2\x80\x99s display. \xe2\x80\x9cI expected to see two teams fighting to get the ball,\xe2\x80\x9d said the former Swansea manager pointedly. \xe2\x80\x9cIn football you need to find a way to compete but I was surprised Swansea did that. But we could have moved the ball a lot quicker and we are normally a lot more penetrating in the final third than we were.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Everton also suffered more defensive problems in a game when they rarely had to defend; it was that kind of day for Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s side. Alcaraz, the Paraguayan defender who appears constructed from papier-mache given his appalling injury record, is facing an extended period out after damaging his shoulder in a collision with Bony. With John Stones sidelined until the new year with an ankle ligament problem, Everton have only Phil Jagielka and Sylvain Distin as established central defenders to see them through until January.</p> <p>Distin was not included on the bench on Saturday, necessitating a defensive move for Gareth Barry after Alcaraz\xe2\x80\x99s exit, and youngsters Tyias Browning and Brendan Galloway, the 18-year-old England under-19 defender signed from MK Dons in the summer, may get an opportunity in the coming months.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSylvain has had a period of not being back to his best,\xe2\x80\x9d the Everton manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is not someone I want to use on the bench at the age of 36. But he is a very important player for us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>There were few negatives for Monk other than the Alcaraz decision and Shelvey\xe2\x80\x99s inability to avoid needless bookings. \xe2\x80\x9cJonjo\xe2\x80\x99s commitment isn\xe2\x80\x99t in question but sometimes his judgment is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Swansea manager. \xe2\x80\x9cThis result meant more to me than the three points against Leicester. You can play all the flowing football you want but there are times when you need to defend and we did that properly against a very good team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Man of the match: James McCarthy (Everton)</p>'
