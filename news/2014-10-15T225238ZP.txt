b'Pep Guardiola keen on one day becoming Manchester United manager'


b'<p>Pep Guardiola has revealed he wants to manage Manchester United at some point in his career, according to reports in a new book that chronicles his title-winning campaign at Bayern Munich last season.</p> <p>In Pep Confidential: The Inside Story of Pep Guardiola\xe2\x80\x99s First Season at Bayern Munich, written by his close friend and journalist Marti Perarnau, the former Barcelona manager admits to being seduced when watching Sir Alex Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s Manchester United in 2011, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI like this atmosphere. I could see myself coaching here one day.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Guardiola took charge of Bayern Munich for the 2013-14 season \xe2\x80\x93 that which Perarnau chronicles \xe2\x80\x93 but had already agreed a move to the Allianz Arena in December 2012, before Ferguson had announced he would be leaving Old Trafford.</p> <p>United did make overtures towards the Spaniard following the sacking of David Moyes in April only to find Guardiola, who is contracted to Bayern until 2016, committed to his job in Munich.</p> <p>However, the revelations made by Perarnau, who had full behind-the-scenes access to Guardiola last season, will not go unnoticed at Old Trafford, even if Louis van Gaal, who made Guardiola his captain at Barcelona, is only three months into his contract.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPep liked the setup at S\xc3\xa4bener Strasse (Bayern\xe2\x80\x99s training facility) despite the fact it was smaller than Bar\xc3\xa7a\xe2\x80\x99s training ground and had fewer technical facilities.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe Catalan was impressed and told [his personal assistant] Manuel Estiarte privately: \xe2\x80\x98I like this place. I could see myself coaching here one day. Pep had said something very similar a few months before, at Manchester United. The day after beating Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-final, Guardiola and Estiarte travelled to Manchester to watch their next opponents in action.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was 4 May 2011, and the pair sat together in the stands of Old Trafford watching Sir Alex Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s team beat Schalke 4-1. Once again Pep had turned to his friend and said: \xe2\x80\x98I like this atmosphere. I could see myself coaching here one day.\xe2\x80\x99 Guardiola has always felt a deep admiration, almost veneration, for the legendary teams and players of Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In his book, Perarnau goes on to claim that both Chelsea and Manchester City were keen to appoint the former Barcelona manager, before he eventually agreed to replace Jupp Heynckes, bringing an end to his year-long sabbatical that began upon leaving the Catalan club at the end of the 2012 season.</p> <p>Perarnau continues: \xe2\x80\x9cDuring his sabbatical year in New York, the job offers poured in. His ex-colleague, Txiki Begiristain, the director of football at Manchester City, was very insistent. He also met up in Paris with Roman Abramovich, who was prepared to do anything to lure Pep to Chelsea \xe2\x80\xa6 Within a few months Pep, had chosen Bayern.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
