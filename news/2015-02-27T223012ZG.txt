b'<p>Gus Poyet believes Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s Manchester United are \xe2\x80\x9cbetter than people think\xe2\x80\x9d. Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s manager, preparing to take his struggling side to Old Trafford on Saturday, said: \xe2\x80\x9cI know it\xe2\x80\x99s easier to see the negative side and I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying they\xe2\x80\x99re hitting the performances the manager is expecting or playing exactly the way Van Gaal wants but look at their results.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Granted United lost at Swansea City last weekend but Poyet points to their run of one defeat in the 19 games before that. In the context of all the turbulence experienced in the wake of Sir Alex Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s departure and David Moyes\xe2\x80\x99 brief tenure, he regards such consistency as impressive.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf Manchester United get into the top four with all the changes that have happened after Ferguson, it would be a big achievement,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Uruguayan, who feels that, for the moment at least, United\xe2\x80\x99s ambitions should probably be on a par with those of Arsenal rather than Chelsea or Manchester City.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLook at Arsenal,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re delighted when they\xe2\x80\x99re in the top four, so why are United not delighted after what\xe2\x80\x99s happened in the last two years. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a decent season for them. There\xe2\x80\x99s been a lot of negativity and it\xe2\x80\x99s true they\xe2\x80\x99ve spent money but they\xe2\x80\x99re doing better than some people thought they would.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>With Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s side currently fourth, one point behind Arsenal, one point ahead of Southampton and two in front of Liverpool, United will be anxious to secure victory at Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s expense.</p> <p>Poyet, though, is anxious to reprise last spring\xe2\x80\x99s Wearside win at Old Trafford. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we won there last season it was the day I felt we were safe [from relegation],\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBeating them again is the aim. We play at Hull on Tuesday and some people may think that\xe2\x80\x99s the game we should target but we\xe2\x80\x99ll try and beat Manchester United and then see about Hull.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He trusts his United old boys John O\xe2\x80\x99Shea and Wes Brown will stand firm at the heart of Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s defence on this latest return to Old Trafford. In the midst of a disappointing campaign at the Stadium of Light O\xe2\x80\x99Shea, who turns 34 in April, has proved outstanding \xe2\x80\x93 and ever present.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s played every minute of every league game and that tells you so much about him. It\xe2\x80\x99s some achievement,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poyet. \xe2\x80\x9cDespite his age I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised. The way he\xe2\x80\x99s going he could keep it up until the end of the season. Why not? He\xe2\x80\x99s a good leader. He\xe2\x80\x99s always willing to play. It was easy to make him captain.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf you know John well, you realise why he played for United for so many years. We\xe2\x80\x99re lucky to have him. He could still be playing regularly in a top-six team. A lot of players leave Manchester United and disappear \xe2\x80\x93 but not John. He\xe2\x80\x99s still a big player.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
