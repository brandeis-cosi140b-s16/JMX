b'Football transfer rumours: Jordan Henderson to Chelsea?'


b'<p>As if that weekend thrashing their team received at the hands of Arsenal and the unsettling hoo-ha regarding Raheem Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s next move weren\xe2\x80\x99t enough to have Liverpool fans weeping into their ale, the Daily Star\xe2\x80\x99s splash that Jordan Henderson could be off to Chelsea may result in plenty more wailing and gnashing of teeth.</p> <p>The small rectangular daily reports that the fragrant, perspiration free Reliant Robin-pushing midfielder, whose contract expires at the end of next season, has joined his fellow Nivea-shilling team-mate Sterling in turning down a new deal. Having become a vital cog in the Liverpool machine following a shaky start to his career at the club, the England international is reported to have declined a new contract worth \xc2\xa380,000 per week and the Star ominously declares that \xe2\x80\x9cmore talks are planned but Chelsea are monitoring the situation closely\xe2\x80\x9d. If true, the prospect of playing Champions League football and possibly winning the Premier League while earning lots more money will surely appeal.</p> <p>In more bad news for Liverpool, the Mirror reports that Brendan Rodgers is facing \xe2\x80\x9ca major dressing room crisis\xe2\x80\x9d amid talk that certain unnamed senior players reacted angrily to his alleged suggestion that they were not performing for him at a clear-the-air meeting convened at their Melwood training ground yesterday.</p> <p>The Manchester Evening News reports that Manchester City could make a rare English signing, having taken a shine to \xc2\xa310m-rated Middlesbrough central defender Ben Gibson, who signed a five-year deal with the club owned by his uncle, Steve, last August. The 22-year-old boyhood Boro fan is also reported to be on Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s radar and both clubs are expected to step up their interest come season\xe2\x80\x99s end. Eager to hog as much space as possible in this Easter Bank Holiday Rumour Mill, Liverpool are also rumoured to be in talks with Monaco about ending Radamel Falcao\xe2\x80\x99s Manchester United misery by taking him on loan from the French club next season.</p> <p>With United, Liverpool and Chelsea all courting Nathaniel Clyne, Southampton will make one last-ditch attempt to persuade the 23-year-old Londoner sign a new and improved deal before making the difficult decision to offload him for a few quid this summer or face losing him for nothing when his contract expires in May 2016. Clyne is already rumoured to have declined an offer of \xc2\xa345,000 per week. With their goalkeeper Fraser Forster ruled out for the season with a serious knee injury, Saints are also being linked with a one-month loan move for Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Petr Cech, while Reading\xe2\x80\x99s Adam Federici is being touted as a longer term replacement if, as feared, Forster faces up to a year on the sidelines.</p> <p>Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood likes the cut of Alessandro Diamanti\xe2\x80\x99s jib and will attempt to bring the former West Ham midfielder back to the Premier League (or Championship) when his contract with Chinese club Gunangzhou expires this summer. The 31-year-old Italian is currently on loan at Fiorentina but will be available on a free transfer in two months time.</p> <p>Having made the grand total of 22 appearances for Chelsea since signing for them from Barcelona in 2011, defensive midfielder Oriel Romeu has spent the past two seasons out on loan at Valencia and Stuttgart. The Catalan has finally decided he wants to sever his ties with Stamford Bridge and sign for a club that will show him a bit more love.</p> <p>Meanwhile in France, Marseille striker Andr\xc3\xa9 Ayew had a depressing Easter Sunday, getting sent off late in his side\xe2\x80\x99s 3-2 Ligue 1 reverse at the hands of Paris Saint-Germain last night. Tottenham Hotspur are just one of several clubs hoping to put the smile back on the Ghanaian\xe2\x80\x99s face with the offer of a big juicy contract when he becomes a free agent this summer, but they\xe2\x80\x99ll face competition from Everton, Newcastle and Bayer Leverkusen, among several other clubs sniffing around the striker. Should the 25-year-old sign for Spurs he\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to pick his pick of the dressing room pegs and lockers vacated by Emmanuel Adebayor, Younes Kaboul, Paulinho and Etienne Capoue, who are all being shown the door.</p>'
