b'<p>All is not well at West Bromwich Albion. After a second successive Premier League defeat was greeted with boos, Albion\xe2\x80\x99s goalkeeper fired a few home truths back at the supporters who had turned on the captain. Ben Foster described the way that Chris Brunt was jeered off the pitch, when the midfielder was withdrawn 20 minutes before the end, as \xe2\x80\x9cpathetic\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>It is not the first time that Brunt \xe2\x80\x93 who has made more than 250 appearances for Albion since joining from Sheffield Wednesday in 2007 \xe2\x80\x93 has been criticised by the fans but Foster took particular exception to the abuse that the Northern Ireland midfielder received. He defended Brunt\xe2\x80\x99s work rate and contribution over the years, and said that the stick that came his way was unjustified and counter-productive.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is absolutely ridiculous that somebody who has been an incredible servant to this club for such a long time gets that,\xe2\x80\x9d Foster said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe always gives his all and he\xe2\x80\x99s somebody I would always have in the team. It\xe2\x80\x99s not needed. It is really silly. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help at all. It\xe2\x80\x99s pathetic, to be honest.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe is everything we\xe2\x80\x99re about. He works his socks off. There\xe2\x80\x99s no need to boo somebody. If he very obviously wasn\xe2\x80\x99t putting it in or couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be bothered, then fair enough, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case. Nobody likes that [being booed], I don\xe2\x80\x99t care who you are, whether you\xe2\x80\x99re the manager, the goalkeeper or centre-forward.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re getting ridiculed and abused like that, it affects you and there\xe2\x80\x99s no need for it. These are our supporters and we need our supporters to support us and not do things like that. It\xe2\x80\x99s not nice. You can understand frustration but it\xe2\x80\x99s not like we\xe2\x80\x99re not trying. If that happens, fans are well within their rights to do whatever they like.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf they can see the club isn\xe2\x80\x99t putting it in and the players aren\xe2\x80\x99t working, they can boo, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>A lack of concentration, rather than a lack of effort, is hindering Alan Irvine\xe2\x80\x99s side. Jonas Olsson\xe2\x80\x99s miskicked clearance led to Everton taking the lead inside two minutes, when Romelu Lukaku dispatched a curling shot into the far corner, and Foster admitted making a \xe2\x80\x9cschoolboy mistake\xe2\x80\x9d in the second half. He allowed Kevin Mirallas\xe2\x80\x99s tame shot to slip under his body at the near post and from that point on the result was never in doubt.</p> <p>For Everton, victory was the shot in the arm that they badly needed before a run of six games in 18 days, starting with Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s visit of Wolfsburg in the Europa League \xe2\x80\x93 a competition that Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez has promised to take seriously. \xe2\x80\x9cLast year we had to work so hard for 38 games to achieve that, so it would be nonsense or stupid to say that we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be giving everything we\xe2\x80\x99ve got,\xe2\x80\x9d the Everton manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe really want to go all the way in the Europa League.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>One of the most gratifying aspects of this first league win of the season for Everton was that they kept a clean sheet after conceding 10 goals in their previous three matches. \xe2\x80\x9cThe gaffer told us in not so many words that we need to improve,\xe2\x80\x9d Tim Howard, the goalkeeper, said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt got hammered into us this week after the internationals, to get the bit between our teeth, and we did that and that is the response we were looking for.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>At the other end of the pitch, Everton have a \xc2\xa328m striker hell-bent on making the most of his talent. \xe2\x80\x9cRomelu wants to be the best footballer in the world, he really does. That\xe2\x80\x99s what he thinks of himself,\xe2\x80\x9d Howard said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe gets his head down and he works, and we push him. He\xe2\x80\x99s electric, he\xe2\x80\x99s alive, he celebrates goals in training, everything counts to him. Everything matters. That\xe2\x80\x99s what you want to see. There are too many young kids that take it for granted. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Man of the match Romelu Lukaku (Everton)</p>'
