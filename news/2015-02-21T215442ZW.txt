b'Worcester City\xe2\x80\x99s Shabir Khan sees red after body-slamming opponent'


b'<p>Anything the Premier League can do, the Conference North can do better, as Worcester City defender Shabir Khan demonstrated in collecting one of the season\xe2\x80\x99s most bizarre red cards so far.</p> <p>While Chelsea were reduced to 10 men in their 1-1 draw with Burnley at Stamford Bridge after Nemanja Matic reacted to a dangerous challenge by Ashley Barnes by shoving him to the ground, Khan saw red for enacting his own brand of revenge against Stockport County\xe2\x80\x99s midfielder Charlie Russell.</p> <p>With the game entering its final five minutes, Russell chased down Khan on the right touchline and caught the full-back with a high challenge. The Worcester player then leapt to his feet, before picking up his assailant and body-slamming him to the ground.</p>       <p>Following a melee involving players from both teams, referee Anthony Coggins showed the former Pakistan international Khan a straight red card, before also booking Russell for the initial challenge. It ended a busy afternoon for the official, who had already shown two yellows to the County striker Jack Ryan \xe2\x80\x93 the second for a late challenge on Khan.</p>'
