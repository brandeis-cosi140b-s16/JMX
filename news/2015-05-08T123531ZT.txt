b'Aston Villa <p> </p> <p>P 35 Pts 35 GD -21</p> <p>Remaining fixtures Saturday West Ham (h), 16 May Southampton (a), 24 May Burnley (h)</p> <p>Past six results (Premier League only; most recent first) WLWDLL</p> <p>What are their chances of staying up?</p> <p>A hell of a lot better than they were when Paul Lambert was in charge. Tim Sherwood has energised the club since taking over. Villa are scoring freely, playing in a much more dynamic way, there is no shortage of self-belief and they have a benign run-in.</p> <p>Why have they ended up struggling?</p> <p>This is the fifth season in succession Villa have flirted with relegation, which suggests the problems are deep-rooted. Lambert must take a large share of the blame for the current position. Just take a look at what Sherwood has achieved with the same group of players.</p> <p>What would be the impact of relegation?</p> <p>Tom Fox, Villa\xe2\x80\x99s CEO, says Villa have contemplated the financial implications of slipping into the Championship \xe2\x80\x93 relegation clauses across the playing staff are in place \xe2\x80\x93 and considered how to get back into the Premier League at the first time of asking. But the best players (Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph) would be nailed on to leave.</p> Newcastle United <p>P 35 Pts 35 GD -24</p> <p>Remaining fixtures Saturday West Brom (h), 16 May QPR (a), 24 May West Ham (h)</p> <p>Past six results LLLLLL</p> <p>What are their chances of staying up?</p> <p>Pretty good in the sense they already have 35 points and face relatively kind remaining fixtures. In terms of momentum, though, the prospects look poor \xe2\x80\x93 they are on a run of eight straight defeats and a fractured dressing room lacks leadership and character.</p> <p>Why have they ended up struggling?</p> <p>The owner Mike Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s failure to restock a slim squad in January when at least one striker and centre-half were required. In the wake of that gamble an unprecedented injury crisis struck and suspensions accumulated. The decision not to replace the Crystal Palace-bound Alan Pardew immediately but muddle through with John Carver until the summer was also pivotal. Accepting an offer for the Italy defender Davide Santon from Internazionale on transfer deadline day proved emblematic of the general short-sightedness.</p> <p>What would be the impact of relegation?</p> <p>Costly. Many players\xe2\x80\x99 contracts lack relegation clauses automatically slashing their wages in the event of a fall into the Championship and they will be hard to offload.</p> Leicester City <p>P 35 Pts 34 GD -15</p> <p>Remaining fixtures Saturday Southampton (h), 16 May Sunderland (a), 24 May QPR (h)</p> <p>Past six results (Premier League only; most recent first) WLWWWW</p> <p>What are their chances of staying up?</p> <p>Very good \xe2\x80\x93 and who would have thought that six games ago? Taking 15 points from a possible 18 has transformed Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s season, confidence is sky high and with two home games to come, including QPR\xe2\x80\x99s visit on the final day, survival is within touching distance.</p> <p>Why have they ended up struggling?</p> <p>After a flying start to the season, including that incredible 5-3 win over Manchester United in September, the goals dried up and Leicester lost their way, with some players, including Jamie Vardy, taking a while to find their feet. Leicester were, however, never quite as bad as the league table suggested.</p> <p>What would be the impact of relegation?</p> <p>Relegation clauses would kick in and, with this Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s first season in the Premier League for a decade and a sensible salary cap in place, parachute payments would help to soften the blow. As for personnel, it is safe to say the Argentinian Esteban Cambiasso, who has been so impressive this season, would not be hanging around in the Championship.  </p> Hull City <p>P 35 Pts 34 GD -15</p> <p>Remaining fixtures Saturday Burnley (h), 16 May Tottenham (a), 24 May Man Utd (h)</p> <p>Past six results LWWLLL</p> <p>What are their chances of staying up?</p> <p>Surprisingly good \xe2\x80\x93 providing they beat Burnley at the KC Stadium on Saturday. Outwardly at least, the experienced Steve Bruce remains relaxed and confident, the players seem upbeat, their 3-5-2 system is flexible, their crossing is decent and, crucially, they are creating chances.</p> <p>Whey have they ended up struggling?</p> <p>Long-term injuries to Nikica Jelavic, Steve Bruce\xe2\x80\x99s best striker, and Mo Diam\xc3\xa9, his most effective midfielder, have been key. So too, the enduring dips in form experienced by Tom Huddlestone and Curtis Davies. With a category three academy still to catch up with the club\xe2\x80\x99s overall progress, promising youngsters are yet to start stepping off the production line.</p> <p>What would be the impact of relegation?</p> <p>With contractual relegation clauses ensuring wages are cut by up to 50% in the event of relegation Hull have a business plan in place for the Championship and are confident back-room staff casualties could be kept to a minimum.</p> Sunderland <p>P 34 Pts 33 GD -22</p> <p>Remaining fixtures Saturday Everton (a), 16 May Leicester (h), 20 May Arsenal (a), 24 May Chelsea (a)</p> <p>Past six results WDLWLL</p> <p>What are their chances of staying up?</p> <p>Not great \xe2\x80\x93 particularly as their cherished game in hand is away at Arsenal and they struggle to create chances, let alone score goals. They do have the excellent Lee Cattermole in central midfield though.</p> <p>Why have they ended up struggling?</p> <p>The team are slow, ageing, lightweight, fairly small and desperately low on flair and invention. Ellis Short, the owner, arguably delayed too long before replacing Gus Poyet with Dick Advocaat and, with last summer\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa310m marquee signing from Manchester City, Jack Rodwell, making minimal impact, the squad is weaker than last season. The academy is not producing any bright youngsters either.</p> <p>What would be the impact of relegation?</p> <p>Although they are insulated by the presence of relegation clauses in most contracts, Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s wage bill is the eighth-highest in the Premier League so would remain a burden. The effect on hotels, restaurants, taxi businesses and shops in a fragile local economy would also be significant \xe2\x80\x93 and highly damaging.</p> Queens Park Rangers <p>P 35 Pts 27 GD -22</p> <p>Remaining fixtures Sunday Man City (a), 16 May Newcastle (h), 24 May Leicester (a)</p> <p>Past six results LDLDWL</p> <p>What are their chances of staying up? Virtually nonexistent. Realistically, they have to win their remaining three games to give themselves any chance; Chris Ramsey has won just two of 12 so far. It is hard to see them clearing the first hurdle at Manchester City on Sunday.</p> <p>Why have they ended up struggling? Harry Redknapp, who began the season as the manager, sometimes gave the impression he did not need it all any more. There were fitness issues early on and, tactically, things did not click. The loss of Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my was a blow. Fundamentally, the players have not been good enough. QPR\xe2\x80\x99s defensive record is the worst in the division.</p> <p>What would be the impact of relegation? </p> <p>There would be a row with the Football League over possible financial fair play breaches during the club\xe2\x80\x99s season in the Championship in 2013-14. QPR have announced losses for the period of only \xc2\xa39.8m but their shareholders wrote off \xc2\xa360m in loans. QPR could be fined very heavily.</p> Burnley <p>P 35 Pts 34 GD -15</p> <p>Remaining fixtures Saturday Hull (a), 16 May Stoke (h), 24 May Aston Villa (a)</p> <p>Past six results LWWLLL</p> <p>What are their chances of staying up?</p> <p>Zero. They cannot win a game, let alone three in a row. Unless they score a goal for the first time since defeating Manchester City in mid-March they will be down by close of play on Saturday.</p> <p>Whey have they ended up struggling?</p> <p>They have not ended up struggling, they have been finding the Premier League hard going all along. Not winning in the first 10 attempts was hardly the best start and, though there have been high points along the way, Burnley have never looked like escaping the bottom three all season. Sean Dyche keeps saying they have never disgraced themselves or been taken apart by opponents, and to the credit of the manager and his players that is true. Yet too often that has looked like the club\xe2\x80\x99s major objective this season, rather than coming to terms with the top flight.</p> <p>What would be the impact of relegation?</p> <p>Nothing alarming. Parachute payments and a good chance of having another go at going up next season. Burnley are well run and sustainable. As long as they keep hold of Dyche and the bulk of their players the future looks quite bright.</p>'
