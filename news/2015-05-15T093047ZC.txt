b'<p>Koke has insisted he will not leave Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid this summer despite Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s interest in signing the Spain midfielder.</p> <p>As reported by the Guardian on Thursday, the reigning Spanish champions have acted to ward off Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s interest in Koke and his team-mate Antoine Griezmann by offering both players new contracts. Those are expected to include buyout clauses set at around \xc2\xa3100m each.</p> <p>But whereas Griezmann is thought to be open to a move to the Premier League, Koke appears happy to remain where he is.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I will play here,\xe2\x80\x9d the 23-year-old told AS when asked about his future.</p> <p>Koke also encouraged Atl\xc3\xa9tico to re-sign the Brazil left-back Filipe Lu\xc3\xads, who joined Chelsea for \xc2\xa315.8m last summer but has found his opportunities limited.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFilipe Lu\xc3\xads is more than a team-mate, he is a friend, so he would be welcome here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Koke. Atl\xc3\xa9tico face Barcelona in Madrid on Sunday knowing defeat would guarantee that Luis Enrique\xe2\x80\x99s side\xc2\xa0succeed them as La Liga champions. But Koke insisted his team will not be doing the visitors any favours. He said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe hope that Barcelona don\xe2\x80\x99t win the league at our ground. We want to finish in third and we\xe2\x80\x99re not a side which does favours; we\xe2\x80\x99ll be going out to win, as we always do.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Petr Cech\xe2\x80\x99s agent has confirmed the Czech international has been given permission to discuss his future with any interested clubs. The 32-year-old has a year remaining on his contract and has been linked with moves to Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPetr has a valid contract with his current club. However, I can confirm that we have been permitted by Chelsea to negotiate with interested parties,\xe2\x80\x9d Viktor Kolar told TalkSport. \xe2\x80\x9cPetr has confirmed his interest to play regularly at a top club.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
