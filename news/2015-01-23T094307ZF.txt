b'FA Cup fourth round: 10 things to look out for this weekend'


b'1) Kramaric\xe2\x80\x99s time to shine? <p>Tottenham had a hard time of it against a Premier League struggler in the third round, so may not be relishing the visit of bottom club Leicester. Nigel Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s side have begun to pick up in 2015 \xe2\x80\x93 one loss from their last five games is not a bad effort \xe2\x80\x93 but goals are still proving hard to come by. Luckily the manager is aware of that, and has brought in a \xc2\xa39m record-signing to rectify the situation. Of course, it does not bode well that Andrej Kramaric\xe2\x80\x99s agent was Bosko Balaban \xe2\x80\x93 a big-money signing for a midlands club who never found the back of the net and was swiftly packed off and forgotten about. Kramaric showed some promise in his first appearance, from the bench in the 1-0 loss to Stoke, and is likely to make his full debut at White Hart Lane. As the Foxes\xe2\x80\x99 goalkeeper Ben Hamer said: \xe2\x80\x9cAndrej doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have time to settle in, he\xe2\x80\x99s got to affect the team straight away.\xe2\x80\x9d There would be no better way to do that than by firing Leicester into the fifth round of the Cup.

So when Neil Lennon\xe2\x80\x99s improving Bolton turn up at Anfield on Saturday evening it will be interesting to see how serious he is about this romantic gesture. With only two days between that match and the second leg of the Capital One Cup semi-final with Chelsea, the Liverpool manager will have to rest some of his team. But how many? Wholesale changes may well suggest he sees a positive result at Stamford Bridge and a visit to Wembley on 1 March as a more realistic chance of winning his first-ever trophy. In fact, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a surprise if Rodgers also has the Europa League higher on his list of priorities than the FA Cup \xe2\x80\x93 given that it offers a Champions League spot to the winner. So perhaps the Liverpool manager could be forgiven for risking embarrassment against Bolton \xe2\x80\x93 for whom former Liverpool players Emile Heskey and Jay Spearing will make Anfield returns \xe2\x80\x93 for a chance to keep his squad fresh for other challenges. Gregg Bakowski</p>           Barry Glendenning talks to Emile Heskey.    3) Middlesbrough should look to Coquelin for inspiration <p>The last time Manchester City had to face Middlesbrough was in the third round in 2010. Benjani scored the only goal in a 1-0 away win at the Riverside. Boro were 11th in the Championship, City were just starting out under Roberto Mancini, fifth in the league and yet to lift a piece of silverware for their new Abu Dhabi owners. While things have changed for the Manchester club, Boro are still toiling to escape the Championship. It\xe2\x80\x99s now five years since their relegation and this season may be their best chance yet. Aitor Karanka has built a sturdy defence that has elevated them into promotion contention. Of course, the Premier League champions boast a forward line slightly higher in calibre than Karanka\xe2\x80\x99s players will be used to facing - their one hope is that Edin Dzeko and Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero are still struggling for fitness. Manchester City looked decidedly off the pace in the loss to Arsenal, and without the drive of Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 and the fresh impetus of Wilfried Bony \xe2\x80\x93 both absent due to the Africa Cup of Nations \xe2\x80\x93 this may be the best time for Boro to face City. David Silva is the diminutive key to City\xe2\x80\x99s creative ambitions, but Francis Coquelin did a job on him in the last game, keeping the Spanish playmaker in his pocket and there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason Boro can\xe2\x80\x99t take a leaf out of his book. It\xe2\x80\x99s only a month ago that the Frenchman was playing in the Championship for Charlton and if he can manage the step up in class, who is to say that Adam Clayton \xe2\x80\x93 who started his career at City \xe2\x80\x93 can\xe2\x80\x99t be similarly inspired at the Etihad? An upset is of course unlikely, but Karanka need only point his players in the direction of Coquelin to show that City are far from unbeatable.

Staff clear snow from the pitch before the match between Rochdale and Crawley on 17 January. The match against Oldham three days later was postponed. Photograph: Matt McNulty/JMP/Rex/Matt McNulty/JMP/REX    <p>It says much about Mark Hughes that the clich\xc3\xa9 about the Britannia Stadium being a difficult place to go now relates more to the windy, inclement conditions that the open-sided and elevated stadium is subject to than the physicality of his Stoke side. That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say his easier-on-the-eye team can\xe2\x80\x99t still mix it up a bit but that\xe2\x80\x99s not their main weapon anymore and the flair of players such as Bojan Krkic and Marko Arnautovic is proving to be just as key to their attacks as the long-throws and punts forwards of the Tony Pulis era. So it will be interesting to see how they deal with a trip to Rochdale\xe2\x80\x99s Spotland, the sixth-highest ground of the 92 league clubs, which is perched up on the foothills of the South Pennines and whose pitch has recently been buried beneath a blanket of snow. It may be that Stoke are the best equipped Premier League side for such a challenge, but it could also be the case that even the team who are still considered the byword for physicality in the top-flight, don\xe2\x80\x99t fancy an evening tussle in the hillside slush. Keith Hill\xe2\x80\x99s side are in some ways a Stoke-lite, a team that has found success by playing a more pleasing style of football than in recent years \xe2\x80\x93 they currently sit fifth in League One and come into this match with three wins on the spin and well rested after their derby with Oldham was postponed. But if there\xe2\x80\x99s one game they may choose to be a bit more direct in, it is this one. And if the cold wind blows, it could be Dale \xe2\x80\x93 and their tall strikers Peter Vincenti and Calvin Andrew \xe2\x80\x93 who stand to benefit. GB</p>  <li>Stephen Dawson: the police told me I could go to prison for match-fixing</li> <li>Krkic could become a Stoke City great, says Hughes</li>  5) Villa in search of an FA Cup tonic <p>Plenty has been written about Villa\xe2\x80\x99s goal drought \xe2\x80\x93 but while they may have gone five league games without hitting the back of the net, it\xe2\x80\x99s only two games ago that Christian Benteke stuck an 88th-minute winner past Blackpool goalkeeper Joe Lewis. So can Championship opposition in the FA Cup come to the aid of their suffering strikers again? Sadly, Bournemouth are rather better set up than bottom-of-the-table Blackpool, sitting astride the Championship, having conceded 25 fewer goals than the Tangerines. It must be tempting for Paul Lambert to take it easy in the Cup, with his side in serious danger of dropping into the relegation places the focus must be on Premier League survival, but a few goals and some Cup progress could be the fillip his demoralised squad need, and also give the Villa Park fans some much-needed 2015 cheer in what has become another dour season for the club. TM</p>  <li>Aston Villa fined \xc2\xa360,000 after failing to control their players </li>  6) Pardew to rekindle Palace\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup fire     Alan Pardew has a 100% record since taking over as Crystal Palace manager. Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA    <p>St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s does not hold the happiest of memories for Alan Pardew \xe2\x80\x93 one season on the South Coast ended with the club stuck in League One amid rumours of fall outs with players and the club chairman. The fans never warmed to him either \xe2\x80\x93 a pattern that looked set to be repeated through the manager\xe2\x80\x99s career until his Crystal Palace homecoming and the joyful welcome from the Selhurst Park faithful. Pardew seems to be relishing that affection, and the club\xe2\x80\x99s derring-do attitude seems perfectly suited for a Cup run, especially since the relegation fears have begun to ease. Southampton are showing that they are no flash in the pan, but recent wins have been by the narrowest of margins, with Ipswich pushing them hard in the last round. Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s time as a player is of course best remembered for that winning goal in extra time of the FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool in 1990. Palace fans will be hoping he can recapture that Cup spirit on Saturday. TM</p>  <li>Palace close in on signing Bolton winger Lee Chung-yong</li>  7) Walcott in need of some shooting practice <p>Arsenal are all a flutter after a rare disciplined display at the Etihad. Of course, in the grand scheme of things it\xe2\x80\x99s all pretty meaningless, they are so far off the league pace that the FA Cup still represents the most likely route to silverware this season. However, that relatively comfortable victory allowed Mesut \xc3\x96zil and Theo Walcott, both recently recovered from injury, to stay sat on the bench. Both are likely to be handed starts at Brighton and a chance to regain some match fitness. Much has been written about \xc3\x96zil, and how the record signing fits into Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s side (although it should not be forgotten it was an Arsenal side inspired by the German that led the Premier League for much of last season), however it is Walcott that may cause Arsenal fans more worry. While Walcott\xe2\x80\x99s darting runs and electric pace should slot right in it\xe2\x80\x99s his finishing which is off. In Walcott\xe2\x80\x99s last two appearances from the bench he has been sent scampering clean through on goal, with both time and space to pick his spot. Each time he has skewed horribly wide. While Walcott has never been the most natural of finishers, it was an attribute that was certainly improving prior to the injury. With \xc3\x96zil pulling the strings, a trip to Championship strugglers Brighton should provide plenty of opportunity for the Englishman to rediscover his shooting boots. TM</p>  <li>Arsenal have \xe2\x80\x9850-50 chance\xe2\x80\x99 of signing \xc2\xa315m Gabriel</li>  8) Youth or experience to come out on top at St Andrew\xe2\x80\x99s? <p>Gary Rowett has done a fantastic job since taking over as Birmingham City manager in October. The Blues were second-bottom of the table, without a win in a month and had just lost 8-0 at home to Bournemouth. Since then they\xe2\x80\x99ve conceded 10 goals in 12 league games, and have only lost twice - giving themselves a chance of reaching the play-offs. And despite a real scare against Blyth in the third round, a Rowett rocket inspired a second-half comeback to earn this tie against top-flight opposition. West Brom have of course brought in their own new manager, Tony Pulis, who is in the midst of stiffening up his team\xe2\x80\x99s backline \xe2\x80\x93 they have only conceded once since he took over. So who will come out on top \xe2\x80\x93 the bright, young thing in the home dugout, or the gnarled, old veteran with an FA Cup final under his belt? TM</p>  <li>Samaras set to leave West Brom on loan to Al-Hilal</li> <li>Berahino \xe2\x80\x98back on track\xe2\x80\x99 at West Bromwich</li>  9) Will Swansea be shot down by the man they want to replace Bony?   <div data-embed-type="table" class="player-card player-card--football" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <div class="player-card__image-container">  </div> <div class="player-card__player"> <div class="player-card__position" itemprop="jobTitle">Striker</div> <div class="player-card__name" itemprop="name">Jordan Rhodes</div> </div> <dl class="player-card__stats"> <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Appearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">26</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Goals</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">9</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">68</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots on target</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">29%</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Offsides</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">15</dd> </dl> </div>   <p>Garry Monk will watch Blackburn\xe2\x80\x99s attacking threat with interest on Saturday. And not just because his Swansea defence have offered about as much resistance as balsa wood does to a blow from a hammer in recent weeks, but because Jordan Rhodes will be leading the line \xe2\x80\x93 the player the club would like to bring in to replace Wilfried Bony. The Swans\xe2\x80\x99 chairman, Huw Jenkins, made an inquiry over Rhodes in 2013 and the striker has been on the club\xe2\x80\x99s radar ever since. Rhodes hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been quite as prolific for Rovers this season as he was last term, when he scored 25 goals in 50 matches, but after four years of consistently finding the back of the net, he is no flash-in-the-pan forward either. With the future of Baf\xc3\xa9timbi Gomis uncertain and Bony out of the door, the 24-year-old penalty-box player could be the man to give Swansea a lift. But first he\xe2\x80\x99ll want to turf them out of the Cup. GB</p>  <li>Blackburn\xe2\x80\x99s Gestede still hopeful of making Crystal Palace move</li>  10) Will Chesterfield enjoy being in the limelight again? <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s almost 19 years since Chesterfield went on that dizzying run to the FA Cup semi-final against Middlesbrough, a match in which their fans saw a perfectly good goal not given while leading Bryan Robson\xe2\x80\x99s Boro 2-1 with just 20 minutes remaining. A fraught game ended up 3-3 after extra-time and went to a replay that Boro won 3-0. If Spireites fans expected similar giddy runs in the Cup after that excursion they were to be deeply disappointed. Since 1996 they have made it to the third round only twice. So the fourth-round tie against Derby at the iPro Stadium, just 20 miles up the road, is comfortably the biggest FA Cup match they have had since they were cruelly denied a Wembley appearance by Fabrizio Ravanelli and co. And what of their chances? Well, with Eoin Doyle topping the League One goalscoring charts and fuelling their playoff push they have no lack of firepower \xe2\x80\x93 Doyle has in fact been linked with a move to Derby. But if they hope to give their fans another FA Cup run to cherish, a defence that has conceded more goals than any other top-10 team in League One will have to be thoroughly switched on to contain Chris Martin. The noise made by the 5,700 fans who make the short journey to Derby won\xe2\x80\x99t do the underdogs\xe2\x80\x99 chances any harm either. GB</p>'
