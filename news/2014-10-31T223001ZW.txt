b'Wayne Rooney hands Manchester United boost but City miss Silva'


b'<p>Wayne Rooney has given Manchester United a big boost by being passed fit to lead the attack in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s derby while the champions will be without their key man David Silva for the next three weeks. Manchester City have lost their past two matches and Silva\xe2\x80\x99s absence means Manuel Pellegrini will be without the player he identifies as his most vital, while United arrive at the Etihad Stadium with the record scorer in the fixture able to start. Radamel Falcao, though, will again be absent due to his calf problem.</p> <p>Rooney was reportedly seen limping at a sponsor\xe2\x80\x99s event on Monday, causing doubt about his participation. However, the striker is available to return following a three-match suspension. Louis van Gaal confirmed that Rooney, his captain, will go straight back into the team while denying that the striker was ever a doubt.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRooney was not injured, the media was writing that,\xe2\x80\x9d the United manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was never injured. Maybe his\xc2\xa0shoes were too tight, that is possible, but he was never injured. He shall play,\xc2\xa0he is my captain. That is all I can say to you because he is my captain and he shall\xc2\xa0play.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>With 11 goals Rooney is the record scorer in the Manchester derby, with eight of these coming in Premier League games \xe2\x80\x93 twice as many as Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero or Edin Dzeko. Van Gaal is aware of Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s success in the fixture. \xe2\x80\x9cI have heard that also he has scored a lot of goals against Manchester City, the most of any player. I said that to him to stimulate him buthe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need that. I am very happy that he can play again and he shall play,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>Rooney can require a run of games to attain optimum physical condition. Yet despite having played only twice in October \xe2\x80\x93 for England \xe2\x80\x93 Van Gaal believes the 28-year-old will be match fit to face City.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think he is very fit because he is training very good,\xe2\x80\x9d said the manager. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was also my surprise that he always\xc2\xa0is very sharp in training sessions. I\xc2\xa0said that already in the USA [on tour]. And he has continued that attitude so I am very happy. And I think he is very fit to play. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any doubts about playing him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Falcao, though, will not face City. \xe2\x80\x9cFalcao is still injured,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Dutchman, for whom Antonio Valencia is available again following a hamstring problem.</p> <p>When assessing the two squads Van Gaal is clear he is not envious of City\xe2\x80\x99s despite it including Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9, Silva, Ag\xc3\xbcero and Vincent Kompany. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not\xc2\xa0jealous\xc2\xa0of Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s squad. I am proud of\xc2\xa0my players and that is the most important thing and, when we play\xc2\xa0like a team, then we have a big chance\xc2\xa0to win.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Victory over City would take United to within a point of their neighbours and provide a psychological fillip. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are waiting on that boost because that can give you more than only the result,\xe2\x80\x9d said Van Gaal. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have played very well against West Brom [drawing 2-2] and we had a draw against Chelsea [1-1], nobody expected that result but for me it was not enough and maybe the result against Manchester City shall give us that boost.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Gaal has emphasised to his players the need to play the match, not the occasion. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is the key because it will be an emotional game,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want a red card because when it is 11 against 10 it will be very difficult.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat is a part of our preparation. In the dressing room I have to analyse what the atmosphere will be like and then I shall say things that are appropriate but the tactical way is the most important way.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Silva will be out for three weeks with a knee ligament injury though Pellegrini is hopeful Tour\xc3\xa9, who has a groin problem, will be available. The manager started both Silva and Tour\xc3\xa9 in Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s 2-0 Capital One Cup defeat by Newcastle United, when each suffered his respective problem.</p> <p>Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cDavid has a problem in his ligament. Maybe he will be out around three weeks so he will not be available for the derby.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYaya has a small problem, we will see him tomorrow but I think he will not have any problems [being fit for the game].\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of Silva he said: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a very important player but I think we have a squad and we have to replace him with another player,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, before discussing Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s indifferent form. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we are a team and in that team we need top players in their performance always.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Despite their indifferent form Pellegrini believes City could finally click against United. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure our team will be again as a strong team and play maybe not as strong [as] the whole of last year but maybe as in the second half of last year,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe continue with our target for this season \xe2\x80\x93 to try to defend our title and to continue in the Champions League. Maybe last year we did better in the Capital One Cup but maybe this year we can win the FA Cup. It\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult to know what will happen in the future.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
