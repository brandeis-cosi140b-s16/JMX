b'Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend\xe2\x80\x99s action'


b'1) De Gea brilliance masks United\xe2\x80\x99s defensive frailties <p>The record books will say a win for Manchester United that was just as convincing as Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s by the same scoreline in the same fixture last season. What is harder to work out is how David de Gea ended up man of the match for most people when United were so demonstrably on top. De Gea is certainly on form at the moment, he was presented with a second successive player of the month award before kick-off at Old Trafford, bringing Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s present goalkeeping problems into sharp focus, but when a goalkeeper is regularly outstanding it usually says something about the protection he is getting from the rest of the team. United did make defensive mistakes against Liverpool \xe2\x80\x93 Jonny Evans\xe2\x80\x99s sloppy backpass should have been punished for a start \xe2\x80\x93but Evans was one of only two regular defenders in the home lineup. Once Luke Shaw, Chris Smalling and Marcos Rojo return United should be more solid at the back, or at least that is the theory. Louis van Gaal still seems to have more attacking-minded players than reliable defenders, though maybe that is the way he likes it.</p>   <div data-embed-type="table" class="player-card player-card--football" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <div class="player-card__image-container">  </div> <div class="player-card__player"> <div class="player-card__position" itemprop="jobTitle">Goalkeeper</div> <div class="player-card__name" itemprop="name">David De Gea</div> </div> <dl class="player-card__stats"> <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Appearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">15</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Saves</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">47</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Clearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">4</dd> </dl> </div>   <p>Going all out in attack paid dividends against an insipid Liverpool, Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata had a field day and Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young were adventurous wing-backs but, whisper it, with more composure from Raheem Sterling and Mario Balotelli the visitors might have rescued a point. Paul Wilson</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Manchester United 3-0 Liverpool\xe2\x80\xa2 Van Gaal says United are fighting their way into the title race\xe2\x80\xa2 Michael Cox: Sterling lacks finishing touch\xe2\x80\xa2 Jamie Jackson: five talking points from Old Trafford</p>               2) Ben Arfa will not be seen in a Hull City shirt again  <p>Back in August the arrival of Hatem Ben Arfa from Newcastle United had appeared a potential coup for Hull City. Here was a player capable of extravagant skill, a creative force who, when on form, could illuminate a team and add fizz to Steve Bruce\xe2\x80\x99s attacking options.</p> <p>Yet his impact was dependent upon the 27-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to buy into the collective\xe2\x80\x99s work ethic given Hull always anticipated a tricky second season in the top flight, and therein lies the reason why his spell at the KC stadium will amount to no more than eight appearances, no assists and no goals. The winger is apparently in Paris working on his fitness in the hope that he can rip up his agreement with Hull next month and move elsewhere, maybe back to France or even South America, as a free agent. English football appears to have had enough of Ben Arfa.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes transfers work out and sometimes they don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruce. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that, with Ben Arfa, I can\xe2\x80\x99t see there being a future. It\xe2\x80\x99s a team game. You have to reform and come into the team and, unfortunately, he wants to do his things his way, which is fair enough. So unless he changes, then I treat him like every other player. But there has been no fall out, he\xe2\x80\x99s been omitted from the squad because when you are up against it, then I believe you need to show a bit of resilience. Unfortunately, Hatem sees it differently.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe has not gone awol, even if I have no idea where he is. He could be in Hull for all I know, or in Paris. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t really want to comment more. This happens. It is a shame. Listen, we were excited to get him on deadline day and, over three or four months, it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite happened for him. These things happen.\xe2\x80\x9d From now on in, they will happen somewhere else for Ben Arfa. Dominic Fifield</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Bruce angry after Gary Cahill escapes card\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Chelsea 2-0 Hull City</p>               3) Life without a target man will test depleted City <p>Leaving aside the issue of how they\xe2\x80\x99ve let themselves get into the position in the first place \xe2\x80\x93 notably why the season-long loan of \xc3\x81lvaro Negredo to Valencia didn\xe2\x80\x99t have some sort of emergency recall clause, even if it was set up purely as a precursor to a permanent deal \xe2\x80\x93 it is going to be very interesting to see whether Manchester City can fiddle their way through the next few games without a recognised target man, and whether, as manager Manuel Pellegrini says they must, the champions can play \xe2\x80\x9ca different way\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Their performance on Saturday, when the teenager Jos\xc3\xa9 \xc3\x81ngel Pozo found himself leading the line alone \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cnot his position\xe2\x80\x9d, Pellegrini subsequently admitted \xe2\x80\x93 suggests they can, but only up to a point. Pozo\xe2\x80\x99s limited success in holding on to the ball and bringing others into play forced the likes of Fernando and Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 to be more positive in support of Frank Lampard, David Silva and Samir Nasri, especially towards the end of the first half. Once ahead, City reverted to type, probably rightly, but their next few opponents will surely be wondering how the game might develop if they can keep City out into the second half. Richard Rae</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Fernandinho: \xe2\x80\x98We will have to answer questions about that 7-1 game for the rest of our lives\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\xa2 Leicester City 0-1 Manchester City</p>  4) Southampton need Rodriguez back as soon as possible <p>When Jay Rodriguez suffered his cruciate ligament injury at Manchester City in April, only Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez, Daniel Sturridge and Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 had scored more Premier League goals. It is a measure of Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s superb start that they have not missed a player who struck 15 times from a starting position on the left flank. Now they are beginning to and a trip to Burnley, Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s former club, was a reminder of the qualities of a man Ronald Koeman has still not been able to select. With the goals drying up for Graziano Pell\xc3\xa8, Dusan Tadic and Sadio Man\xc3\xa9, a player of his potency would have provided a small squad with welcome reinforcements. Instead, Southampton are still to set a date for Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s comeback. Richard Jolly</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Burnley 1-0 Southampton</p>  5) Oxlade-Chamberlain\xe2\x80\x99s new-found freedom must be not be curtailed <p>Olivier Giroud and Santi Cazorla grabbed the headlines after Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s victory over Newcastle, with Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez once again praised for his creativity and dynamism, but the match was also notable for the way Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain moved seamlessly back into the Gunners\xe2\x80\x99 midfield three. Since signing for the Gunners three years ago, the 21-year-old has played all across the midfield but this season he has benefited from being given a consistent run on the right of Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s front three in the absence of Theo Walcott. S\xc3\xa1nchez aside, Oxlade-Chamberlain has been Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s most impressive player, driving at full-backs at lightning pace and displaying impressive close control to boot. Injuries to Jack Wilshere, Aaron Ramsey and Mikel Arteta dictated that he switch to the centre against Alan Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s side and he performed admirably, but there is no doubt his ability to isolate defenders and take them on one-on-one is curtailed in that role. The England international\xe2\x80\x99s ability to turn off either foot, spray crossfield passes and use his strength as well as skill to shrug off defenders make him well-equipped to thrive in a deeper role, and Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger has gone on record in the past to suggest his future may lie in the centre. But for now it would be a shame if the new-found freedom in his game were to be restricted by him being asked to track runners back towards his own goal. Rob Bleaney</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Wenger praises Giroud after Arsenal ease past Newcastle \xe2\x80\xa2 Wenger praying for luck in Champions League draw </p>               6) Albion should persevere with Irvine until at least the summer <p>Thankfully for Alan Irvine and, it can cogently be argued, West Bromwich Albion, The Hawthorns hosted a home victory on Saturday and the prospect of a further managerial change receded. But if West Brom had lost for a fourth successive home game, would that have made Irvine a bad coach?</p> <p>Sure you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to win enough games to stay up, basically. But stick Romelu Lukaku or Christian Benteke on top of this team and West Brom could compete for a top-half finish. On the back of Roy Hodgson\xe2\x80\x99s consolidation at the club, Steve Clarke gave Lukaku his head in his only full season in charge and a 17-goal haul from the marauding on-loan striker enabled West Brom to finish eighth, their best top-flight placing in three decades.</p> <p>Yet such is the double-edged sword of the Albion hierarchy, a coach at The Hawthorns is judged on the players he is granted to work with on the training ground. Although Saido Berahino may develop into a top-class forward, he is not the focal point of an attack, and, anyway, he is struggling at the moment with form and off-field issues.</p> <p>Clarke was given only four months at the start of last season and, with identical results to those achieved by Irvine this term, was jettisoned at this stage. But, after the ill-fated reign of Pepe Mel, Irvine came into a club where Terry Burton was also new to his position of technical director as an entire team of players departed. The recruitment process was subsequently a mess and now Irvine is working with a group of players he basically inherited.</p>   <div data-embed-type="table" class="player-card player-card--football" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <div class="player-card__image-container">  </div> <div class="player-card__player"> <div class="player-card__position" itemprop="jobTitle">Defender</div> <div class="player-card__name" itemprop="name">Joleon Lescott</div> </div> <dl class="player-card__stats"> <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Appearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">12</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots blocked</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">7</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Clearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">87</dd> </dl> </div>   <p>Brown Ideye, at \xc2\xa310m, has yet to adapt to the needs of the English game, on the training ground as well as the pitch, but has the requisite pace to help Berahino and co stretch defences. Of the successful newcomers, Joleon Lescott has been in international form, S\xc3\xa9bastien Pocognoli is a talented left-back and Craig Gardner is coming good. Seeking a sixth head coach in four years now would just bring another round of player turnover.</p> <p>January is not traditionally a good transfer window for a troubled club anyway. But let Irvine, whose reputation as a coach is renowned, work with Burton through a summer\xe2\x80\x99s transfer market and then judge how suited he is to a top-flight dugout. Peter Lansley </p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 West Brom 1-0 Aston Villa</p>  7) G\xc3\xb3mez\xe2\x80\x99s stock rises in Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s Sunderland meritocracy <p>Most Sunderland fans are agreed Lee Cattermole is Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s best defensive midfielder and, on current form, Sebastian Larsson deserves one of the two central slots in front of Cattermole. The other berth has turned into a straight fight between Jordi G\xc3\xb3mez, a free transfer from Wigan Athletic, and Jack Rodwell, a \xc2\xa310m buy from Manchester City. Both arrived in the summer and, right now, G\xc3\xb3mez is winning hands down. With Rodwell struggling to live up to his expensive price tag the Spaniard \xe2\x80\x93 a product of Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s youth system \xe2\x80\x93 has started seven of Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s last 10 Premier League games and featured in all their three victories (two in the League, one in the Capital One Cup) this season. Which just goes to prove you don\xe2\x80\x99t always get what you pay for \xe2\x80\x93 and that Gus Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s team is a meritocracy. The hope with Rodwell is that he will prove a slow burner who eventually blossoms into a special midfielder but, with Adam Johnson also having endured a few ups and downs since swapping City for Sunderland, the Wearsiders have been reminded of the dangers inherent in paying top dollar for players who have spent far too long warming the bench at leading clubs. In contrast, snapping up G\xc3\xb3mez \xe2\x80\x93 arguably Wigan\xe2\x80\x99s best player last season \xe2\x80\x93 on a free was an extremely smart piece of business. Louise Taylor</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Sunderland 1-1 West Ham</p>  8) Warnock seems over-reliant on January transfer dealings to lift Palace   <div data-embed-type="table" class="player-card player-card--football" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <div class="player-card__image-container">  </div> <div class="player-card__player"> <div class="player-card__position" itemprop="jobTitle">Midfielder</div> <div class="player-card__name" itemprop="name">Yannick Bolasie</div> </div> <dl class="player-card__stats"> <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Appearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">16</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Goals</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">1</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">36</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots on target</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">25%</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Offsides</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">6</dd> </dl> </div>   <p>Crystal Palace are currently locked together with Burnley just above the relegation zone but Sean Dyche\xe2\x80\x99s men look to have more upward mobility. Burnley seem to have more in common with Tony Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s Palace than Neil Warnock\xe2\x80\x99s side do even though the latter features most of the same players who developed solidity and sharpness under Pulis and became adept at forcing 1-0 wins last season. A sequence of one victory in their last 10 matches shows that Warnock has yet to find the formula for success at Palace. The manager talks as if only the January transfer window can solve the club\xe2\x80\x99s woes, particularly their inability to take enough of the chances that they create. Whatever the club decide to do, Palace can expect the second half of the season to be tougher than the first, as they have failed to profit from a relatively comfortable run of home fixtures and all of the big teams are due to visit Selhurst Park over the coming months. And in January Palace will lose their most creative player as Yannick Bolasie departs for the Africa Cup of Nations, with the first match he is due to miss being the trip to Burnley. Paul Doyle</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Crystal Palace 1-1 Stoke City</p>               9) Spurs strive for consistency <p>Tottenham have put consecutive league victories together just twice so far this season: wins over West Ham and QPR at the beginning of the campaign and the 2-1 victories over Hull and Everton last month. But after Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s smash and grab at Swansea (by that now familiar 2-1 scoreline) and Burnley and Leicester to come next, this must surely be the point where they attain some consistency \xe2\x80\x93 even if Manchester United and Chelsea follow after. The manager, Mauricio Pochettino, praised his younger players \xe2\x80\x93 Harry Kane (21) and Christian Eriksen (22) scored the goals, while five other members of the starting XI were 24 or under \xe2\x80\x93 after the win in Wales but until they can put a run of results and indeed good performances together, the jury will remain out on both the manager and his bright young things. Alan Smith</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Swansea City 1-2 Tottenham Hotspur</p>  10) Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s bold move means they must now act fast <p>Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s defeat to Manchester City on Saturday was predictable enough on the face of it but, with the champions considerably weakened and arriving on the back of their midweek\xe2\x80\x99s exertions in Rome, it was hard to shake off the feeling that Nigel Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s side would have produced something slightly more barnstorming three months ago. Things have gone badly wrong since the heady early-season days that were crystallised in that 5-3 win over Manchester United, and 11 games without a win is usually more than enough to set heads rolling in the Premier League. Sure enough, one has \xe2\x80\x93 but not that of the ever-belligerent Pearson. Terry Robinson, the club\xe2\x80\x99s director of football, has bitten the dust and this presumably sets the stage for a proactive winter of player recruitment. Much of Robinson\xe2\x80\x99s remit appears to have been transfer-related but Leicester, while priding themselves on adding sparingly and carefully to a squad that has succeeded to a large extent by virtue of minimal disruption, were not able to add sufficient depth in the summer and there remains a sense that \xc2\xa38m for Leonardo Ulloa, even if he has scored six goals, was not the canniest of deals. While it is refreshing to see a club stand by its first-team manager in such situations, this is a clear indication of where Leicester see many of their current problems: adding someone with outstanding contacts, knowledge of the market and a willingness not to rip Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s painstaking work to shreds does not seem an easy task at short notice but it is something that will need to be effected before January if any real difference is to be made.
