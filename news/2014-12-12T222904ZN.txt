b'Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s Alan Pardew thankful for Jak Alnwick, his No3 goalkeeper'


b'<p>Jak Alnwick was fed up. Consigned to the obscurity of life as Newcastle United\xe2\x80\x99s third-choice goalkeeper and denied a chance to shine on loan elsewhere, the 21-year-old knew something had to change. He arranged a meeting with Alan Pardew and proceeded to tell him he was \xe2\x80\x9cvery disappointed\xe2\x80\x9d in his management and felt \xe2\x80\x9clet down\xe2\x80\x9d. As a younger coach, Pardew might have responded abrasively but, at 53, his overriding reaction was amusement.</p> <p>Behind the Newcastle manager\xe2\x80\x99s smile lay a certain respect for the youngster\xe2\x80\x99s audacity allied to an appreciation of Alnwick\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety about the future. \xe2\x80\x9cYou had to admire Jak really,\xe2\x80\x9d says Pardew. \xe2\x80\x9cEspecially as he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really in a position to bang the door down on me \xe2\x80\x93 we\xe2\x80\x99d just won four games in a row and it was before Tim Krul\xe2\x80\x99s injury. But Jak\xe2\x80\x99s contract is up in the summer.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>At the time neither man could have envisaged the impending drama waiting to ambush them. Shortly after that exchange in Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s training ground office last month came the news that Krul would be sidelined until late January. Suddenly Alnwick was warming the bench as understudy to Rob Elliot and finally appreciating why another club had not been allowed to borrow him. After spending so long in Krul\xe2\x80\x99s considerable shadow, Elliot suffered a piece of wretched luck when he tore a thigh muscle and realised that he, too, would be in the treatment room until the new year but, for Alnwick, opportunity finally knocked.</p> <p>At half-time last Saturday, with the score 0-0 against Chelsea, he made his senior debut in front of 52,000 spectators at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park. Within 60 seconds he had applied a fist to the ball and a knee to the back of Diego Costa. The Spanish striker immediately crumpled to the floor.</p> <p>Two fabulous saves in a 2-1 home win followed before the novice stepped, blinking, into the limelight. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I\xe2\x80\x99m in shock,\xe2\x80\x9d said the younger brother of Peterborough\xe2\x80\x99s goalkeeper Ben.</p> <p>Now he is preparing to start against Arsenal at the Emirates on Saturday evening. After that comes Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s Capital One Cup quarter-final at Tottenham and then, next Sunday, it\xe2\x80\x99s back to St James\xe2\x80\x99 for the Tyne-Wear derby. On Wearside they still remember that, back in 2008, Newcastle lured Alnwick from Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s academy.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think Jak knows this is a real game changer for him,\xe2\x80\x9d says Pardew. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll have, roughly, seven matches in goal and it\xe2\x80\x99s a great opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d Even so, Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s manager is keeping everything crossed that a keeper whose previous competitive experience amounted to nine appearances for the Conference side Gateshead during his solitary loan adventure in 2011 does not choke under sustained pressure.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough he\xe2\x80\x99s very young to be Newcastle United\xe2\x80\x99s goalkeeper Jak is confident he can do the job,\xe2\x80\x9d says Pardew. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s hope he can. The ball is very much in Jak\xe2\x80\x99s court. Who knows, after five or six games we might be kicking ourselves that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t give him a new contract earlier. It might have been cheaper. Jak\xe2\x80\x99s a humble guy. He\xe2\x80\x99s got no delusions of grandeur but he believes he\xe2\x80\x99s ready.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>His display against Chelsea certainly prompted questions as to how good other Premier League No3s might be if called to arms. If some, such as Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s 24-year-old Ben Amos, still have youth on their side, others are old hands, winding down careers while offering high-profile managers added insurance. Apart from Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s 42-year-old Mark Schwarzer and Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Richard Wright (37), their ranks include Alnwick\xe2\x80\x99s boyhood hero, Hull\xe2\x80\x99s Steve Harper (39).</p> <p>The current poster boy for third choices is Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Emiliano Mart\xc3\xadnez. The 22-year-old Argentinian recently kept three straight clean sheets against Dortmund, West Brom and Southampton after injuries to Wojciech Szczesny and David Ospina. He may well be back on the bench on Saturday but has already vindicated a difficult summer-time decision to fight to become Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s first choice.</p> <p>Having gained vital experience on loan at Sheffield Wednesday last season, Mart\xc3\xadnez remains several steps ahead of Alnwick. It rather begs the question as to why Newcastle have not recruited an experienced replacement keeper under the emergency loan system. After all, their temporary No2 is the 17-year-old Freddie Woodman, son of the club\xe2\x80\x99s goalkeeping coach, Andy Woodman. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve two fit professionals and until you\xe2\x80\x99re down to one you can\xe2\x80\x99t call that emergency loan in,\xe2\x80\x9d says Pardew. \xe2\x80\x9cFreddie\xe2\x80\x99s a professional, even though he\xe2\x80\x99s 17.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Matters are complicated by Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s possession of a third registered keeper \xe2\x80\x93 even though Karl Darlow, signed from Nottingham Forest last summer, is spending this season back at the City Ground. \xe2\x80\x9cKarl can\xe2\x80\x99t be recalled so that rule is wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d says Pardew. \xe2\x80\x9cIf every other club can have an emergency loan and we can\xe2\x80\x99t purely because we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a keeper out on loan for a year, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be looked at.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Andy Woodman trusts there will be no need. \xe2\x80\x9cJak\xe2\x80\x99s an incredibly mature young man,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cTalking to him or watching him play, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s just 21, there\xe2\x80\x99s this calmness and assurance about him. He\xe2\x80\x99s like a lot of young English players, bags of talent and good character but it\xe2\x80\x99s all about getting the chance and, as a goalkeeper, it\xe2\x80\x99s even harder to be given that chance. I\xe2\x80\x99ll have absolutely no worries about Jak at Arsenal, he\xe2\x80\x99ll handle the occasion. In fact, he\xe2\x80\x99ll relish it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Born in the prosperous Northumberland town of Hexham, Alnwick grew up in a Newcastle-supporting household, dreaming of keeping goal at St James\xe2\x80\x99. If, as many predict, Krul moves on next summer, he would revel in the chance to persuade Pardew that he, rather than Darlow or Elliot, is the Holland keeper\xe2\x80\x99s natural heir.</p> <p>Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s manager likes what he sees in training and is desperate to be convinced but requires the proof only first team games can offer. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99m honest, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether Jak\xe2\x80\x99s good enough yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he acknowledges. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what can I do?\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
