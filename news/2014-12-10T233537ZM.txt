b'Manchester City deserve more media credit, says Manuel Pellegrini'


b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini rounded on Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s critics after Roma were beaten and the Champions League knockout stage was reached, with the manager claiming his side are a complete team.</p> <p>City won 2-0 through a spectacular 60th-minute Samir Nasri strike and Pablo Zabaleta\xe2\x80\x99s late goal as CSKA Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s defeat in Munich confirmed Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s side as second in the group. City had won only once previously in the section, the 3-2 win over Bayern a fortnight ago, as they struggled for form in the competition.</p> <p>Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a lot of different critics. Last time we qualified with many points but played Barcelona and had a player sent off [in the last 16]. This year against the Russian team [CSKA Moscow] we drew a game and that was important but we recovered and we are playing the same way in Premier League and Champions League. This team deserve a little more credit than the press always give us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini had named a team without Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero, Vincent Kompany, David Silva and Stevan Jovetic, because of respective injuries and match-fitness concerns, plus the suspended Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9.</p> <p>The greatest loss was that of the 19-goal Ag\xc3\xbcero but the manager said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are more than just Kun. This team is more than just one player. It\xe2\x80\x99s not relief [we feel]. After we beat Bayern I knew we had a good chance. I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy because we beat a good team and played well from the beginning to the end. I trust in the players and the squad deserves more credit.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think the two centre-halves played very well. Mart\xc3\xadn Demichelis is experienced and Mangala we bought because he is a good player. He had some problems but I trust him and they both played very well. We are a compete team defending and attacking.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In Monday\xe2\x80\x99s draw in Nyon, City will be drawn against a group winner other than Bayern or Chelsea. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will see in February what happens,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pellegrini. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not trying to send messages to people. We must forget about the Champions League now. We have important games in the Premier League and that is as important, maybe it is more important.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy message? We are happy because we achieved a target and now we will try to catch Chelsea. I think Roma are a good team and played well but against Roma in Manchester it was the worst we played and we still drew. Here I knew that if we played as we have in the Premier League then we had a good chance to qualify.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>This was City\xe2\x80\x99s sixth consecutive win. \xe2\x80\x9cTrust has been key,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Chilean. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were sure playing the way we have played in recent weeks we must win. We recovered our normal performance, playing good pressing and playing well with the ball. We are a solid team, we are recovering the ball in the correct way. I had a lot of trust in what we could do. I said I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about players not in the team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of Kompany\xe2\x80\x99s potential availability, Pellegrini added: \xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been a risk to play Vincent. I am hoping he is fit for the weekend.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Nasri said: \xe2\x80\x9cI think the performance of the team was amazing. It was important for me to score. After the surgery I took a while to get to my full level; now I am. With Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 and Kun Ag\xc3\xbcero missing, it was important to show we were a team and we did it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
