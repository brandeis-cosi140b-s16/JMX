b'Real Madrid slip in Turin may spell end for tightrope walker Carlo Ancelotti | David Hytner'


b'<p>The first reaction, outside the madhouse that is Real Madrid, is one of incredulity. Carlo Ancelotti, the manager who won the Champions League last season and might retain it next month, has a fair chance of being sacked by the president, Florentino P\xc3\xa9rez. What?! Why? And how?</p> <p>Welcome to the impossible-to-fathom world of P\xc3\xa9rez who has taken expectation levels into a whole new orbit. He appointed Ancelotti at the beginning of last season but, after what had been a fight to get the Italian from Paris Saint-Germain, the impression quickly formed in Madrid that P\xc3\xa9rez preferred the chase to the reality of the working relationship.</p>  <p> Related: Real Madrid stay in hot pursuit of Barcelona in the race to win La Liga | Sid Lowe </p>   <p>He began to chunter behind the scenes and, when that happens, the headlines follow and the manager comes to live a do-or-die existence. Ancelotti\xe2\x80\x99s role in the Copa del Rey final triumph over Barcelona in April of last year barely seemed to register with P\xc3\xa9rez and he went into the Champions League final against Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid knowing defeat would have spelt the end. Sergio Ramos\xe2\x80\x99 injury-time equaliser kept him in the job before Real eased to the trophy in extra time.</p> <p>As Ancelotti prepares for the first leg of this season\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League semi-final \xe2\x80\x93 against Juventus, the club he once managed, in Turin \xe2\x80\x93 the mood music has not changed. If anything the volume has been turned up. Before the quarter-final second leg against Atl\xc3\xa9tico last month there were reports that Ancelotti would be sacked if Real lost. In March there were similar stories 10 days before the league game at Barcelona.</p> <p>P\xc3\xa9rez called a press conference after the pre-cl\xc3\xa1sico controversy to deny the reports, meaning those in attendance were treated to the sight of a president attacking journalists he had surely briefed over a manager he no longer truly believed in. It summed up the contradictions of P\xc3\xa9rez\xe2\x80\x99s tenure which have left even the battle-hardened Ancelotti baffled.</p> <p>It should be said Real did lose the cl\xc3\xa1sico and Ancelotti remained in situ although it is at the end of the season when his fate is expected to be decided. Zinedine Zidane, the coach of Real\xe2\x80\x99s second team, Castilla, is a leading candidate to take over. At that wacky press conference, Perez said that Ancelotti would stay no matter what happened against Barcelona but he did not say for how long.</p> <p>Ancelotti\xe2\x80\x99s team finished three points behind the league champions, Atl\xc3\xa9tico, in third place last season \xe2\x80\x93 which was considered as abject failure \xe2\x80\x93 while they currently sit second, two points off the leaders, Barcelona, with three matches to play.</p> <p>It is far from inconceivable Ancelotti will win the title and even add another Champions League. Yet uncertainly clings to his prospects.</p> <p>Ancelotti is hardly a stranger to the cut-throat world of elite-level club football. His dismissal, for example, by Juventus at the end of the 2000-01 season stands as a monument to brutality. The story goes he was sacked during half-time of the final game of the Serie A season, against Atalanta, while the club retained hopes of overhauling Roma and winning the title. In the end they fell short.</p> <p>Everybody inside the stadium was talking about it but Ancelotti maintains the news was not given to him that day. The bullet was fired 24 hours later when he was informed Marcelo Lippi was on his way back to the club as his successor.</p> <p>Ancelotti would go on to Milan and achieve his revenge when he beat Lippi and Juventus in the 2003 Champions League final. It was the first of his three Champions League titles as a manager \xe2\x80\x93 the second also came with Milan, in 2007 \xe2\x80\x93 while he won two as a Milan player in 1989 and 1990.</p>  <p> Related: Muted celebrations do not diminish Max Allegri\xe2\x80\x99s achievement at Juventus | Paolo Bandini </p>   <p>He was never popular among a section of the Juventus support, who resented him for having been in opposition to them as a player and his two-and-a-bit seasons at the club were testing. \xe2\x80\x9cI did have some problems with some fans but what can I say?\xe2\x80\x9d Ancelotti said here on Monday night. In Italy, he has long been identified with Milan.</p> <p>Ancelotti worked under Silvio Berlusconi at Milan and Roman Abramovich at Chelsea \xe2\x80\x93 the latter notoriously fired him in a corridor at Goodison Park less than an hour after the final game of the 2010-11 season against Everton. He had won the Premier League and FA Cup double the previous season. Ancelotti, though, has been shocked at how things work at Madrid. Perez has routinely complained about his style of football but there is the sense, from Ancelotti\xe2\x80\x99s side, that there is just no pleasing some people. Or, more precisely, one person.</p> <p>Part of Ancelotti has had enough and another part of him wants to stay. This Madrid squad, after all, is supremely gifted. But either way the 55-year-old is phlegmatic and he seldom betrays frustration in public. It was no different here. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the Champions League,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have courage, you win. If you have fear, you lose.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Winning is the only thing he can do.</p>'
