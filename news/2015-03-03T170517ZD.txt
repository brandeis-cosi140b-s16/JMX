b'Dave Whelan speaks! And no, not about that. Or that!'


b'NOT A SINGLE MENTION OF NINETEEN SIXTY WHEN <p>The 1960 FA Cup final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Blackburn Rovers was described in Ye Olde Bigge Paper as \xe2\x80\x9cone of the quietest, most apathetic FA Cup finals Wembley has known\xe2\x80\x9d. In an attempt to counterbalance this, Blackburn left-back Dave Whelan has subsequently droned on, at considerable length and volume, over a 55-year period, at regular five-minute intervals, in the blowhard style, about the broken leg he suffered in that dreadful game, which ended 3-0 to Wolves and would otherwise have been completely forgotten. So thanks to Dave for constantly reminding us of that one.</p> <p>This exceptionally quiet/ear-splittingly loud dynamic would go on to influence bands such as Pixies and Nirvana. But that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be Whelan\xe2\x80\x99s only contribution to world culture! He also earned many millions of pounds by building up the JJB Tat Emporium chain, and subsequently invested some of them in Wigan Athletic, a club which under his ownership rose from the fourth tier to the top flight, a fairytale story ending in an FA Cup win. And relegation. And probably another relegation, with Whelan having just completed a six-week ban for indulging in 1930s-style patter, and his current manager awaiting the outcome of a racism, sexism, antisemitism and homophobia charge. Probably a good time to be getting off, all told.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the game for 61 years since signing professional forms for Blackburn Rovers,\xe2\x80\x9d began Whelan today. But as the world prepared for the usual clunking segue into a six-hour monologue about Norman Deeley, Whelan wrongfooted us all by announcing: \xe2\x80\x9cBut there comes a time when it\xe2\x80\x99s time to retire. You lose your memory, your judgment is not the same, you forget the players\xe2\x80\x99 names. I never used to do things like that. I think the time has come for me to step down.\xe2\x80\x9d </p> <p>And so chairman Whelan will be handing the reins to 23-year-old grandson David Sharpe, who recently lost grandpops \xc2\xa31.3m in doomed water-burning restaurant venture Sharpy\xe2\x80\x99s Fish &amp; Chips. Not a perfect business record by any means, though that financial hit, while severe, is still \xc2\xa3700,000 lighter than the sum Wigan wasted on Jason Scotland during Whelan\xe2\x80\x99s reign. And watching Scotland clank around aimlessly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t half as much fun as witnessing chefs covering themselves head-to-toe in flour, slipping around in pools of batter, and trying to extinguish their flaming hats by slapping each other over the head with wet hake. So let\xe2\x80\x99s give the lad a chance.</p> <p>Whelan then went on to express what was clearly genuine sorrow and contrition over his recent daft utterances, so fair\xe2\x80\x99s fair, he deserves the benefit of the doubt too. And in an exclusive Sky Sports interview lasting three minutes and 38 seconds, there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a single mention of Nineteen Sixty When. Hats off to Dave! Having said all that, he might have slipped a few subliminal stills of his ill-fated afternoon under the twin towers into Sky\xe2\x80\x99s film, Chris Morris-style, so until we\xe2\x80\x99ve checked all the footage frame by frame, we\xe2\x80\x99re not wiping his slate totally clean just yet.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Follow Aston Villa 1-2 West Bromwich Albion with Scott Murray\xe2\x80\x99s MBM at 7.45pm GMT.</p> <p>And join Paul Doyle for a bit of Premier League and Football League clockwatching from 7.30pm.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY 1 <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEngland seem to want to run everything and take over the whole game.
