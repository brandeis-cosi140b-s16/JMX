b'<p>BEWARE OF GODS BEARING GIFTS</p> <p>In Greek mythology \xe2\x80\xa6 stick with us here \xe2\x80\xa6 Epimetheus was employed by the gods to go about distributing positivity to the new animals the chaps upstairs were rattling off the production line. But his brother, Prometheus, was a bit less cheery and he angered the gods by stealing fire from them. (That bit is less important to the juddering link The Fiver is about draw between Epimetheus and a Premier League manager with customary subtlety but, still, go with us, it all pays off in the ... well, it will kill a few minutes). In revenge for Prometheus\xe2\x80\x99s act, the gods sent Epimethus a gift in the form of hot young thing Pandora and Epimethus took one look at her and thought: \xe2\x80\x9cAwlrrriiiight!\xe2\x80\x9d Awkwardly, the gods also gave Pandora a jar which contained all the evils of humanity and when she opened it, quite a lot of bad stuff happened. Epimetheus \xe2\x80\x93 whose name, incidentally, translates as \xe2\x80\x98hindsight\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 got the blame. Beware of gods bearing gifts, ran headlines in the ancient Greek tea-time rags of the time.</p> <p>When Everton manager Bobby Mart\xc3\xadnez signed Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o in the summer, it seems he was unaware of the tale of Epimetheus, whose general policy of bestowing positivity on everything and everyone the cultured Catalonian shares. He more than readily accepted the Cameroonian striker famous for his lighthearted banter and quick quips. \xe2\x80\x9cHe could have chosen any league in the world and any team just to further his career. He chose to come to Everton because he wanted to be successful \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s it. I see him as a gift from the footballing gods!\xe2\x80\x9d cheered Bobby M.</p> <p>And for a while, things went along swimmingly. There was the striker\xe2\x80\x99s 76th-minute goal against his former employers Chelsea on his first appearance for the club, in which the mystero-genarian stuck one in the eye to the \xe2\x80\x9cfool\xe2\x80\x9d Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho, who had idly wondered whether the striker\xe2\x80\x99s birth certificate stood up to close scrutiny. There was that time he helped a toddler in a bin read a book entirely about himself. There was the late Big Vase equaliser against, erm, FK Krasnodar. The double against Burnley. There was \xe2\x80\xa6 erm \xe2\x80\xa6 oh.</p> <p>So now the gift from the gods \xe2\x80\x93 once praised by his manager because of \xe2\x80\x9chis experience and knowhow\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 found himself replaced in last night\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup squad to face West Ham by the experienced know-how of Conor McAleny, 22-year old academy graduate with a total of two substitute appearances for the club. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had a couple of clubs contact us in the last 12 hours so I decided it was better now to leave him out of the squad,\xe2\x80\x9d did-I-really-once-call-him-a-gift-from-the-gods-no-no-must-have-been-someone-else-ed Bobby M, sharing another of Epimitheus\xe2\x80\x99s characterisitics \xe2\x80\x93 hindsight \xe2\x80\x93 before offering to take Eto\xe2\x80\x99o down the travel agents to book him a first-class ticket aboard the luxury cruise liner Do One.</p> <p>By coincidence, there is a clause in the apostrophe-hungry forward\xe2\x80\x99s contract that automatically triggers a year-long contract extension should he start 15 games for Everton this season. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s natural he\xe2\x80\x99ll get another year,\xe2\x80\x9d chirped Mart\xc3\xadnez in October when Eto\xe2\x80\x99o had bagged four in nine. But now that the striker has scored no further goals, yet is three starts shy of actually prompting that extension and trousering a reported \xc2\xa375,000-a-week for another 12 months, the situation has changed somewhat and Sampdoria and Inter are offering come-hither looks. But then again, perhaps there\xe2\x80\x99s another reason Eto\xe2\x80\x99o is heading rapidly towards the emergency exits. \xe2\x80\x9cFor me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bobby M on his decision to sign his gift from the gods from Chelsea in August, \xe2\x80\x9cthe tipping point was when he said the reason for wanting to stay with a team in the Premier League was to win honours.\xe2\x80\x9d Ah.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Tom Bryant from 7.45pm GMT for MBM coverage of the Ipswich Town 1-2 Southampton FA Cup third-round replay.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>6 January: \xe2\x80\x9cJewelly is someone I have known for a long time. We got to know each other on coaching courses as well as in opposition \xe2\x80\x93 he has massive experience and when I thought about what I wanted for this post, he fitted the bill perfectly. I\xe2\x80\x99m delighted we have got him and I am sure the players will enjoy working with him\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Tony Pulis welcomes new coach Paul Jewell to West Brom.</p> <p>14 January: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not by mutual consent and it is in the hands of my lawyer.

The obscene prices that companies have had to pay in the past to cross the canal with a little-used-once-installed resource leads me to believe they may demand similar fees for carrying, say, Radamel Falcao\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Kristian Karamfiles.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI commend The Fiver for finally getting off its tail and doing some proper journalism with its expos\xc3\xa9 of the murky world of Caribbean Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or voting (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver). Though, if The Fiver really wanted to impress The Man, it would ask why Fifa lets us know how the voters voted for the Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or but remains steadfastly unwilling to give any transparency to the World Cup bidding process\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Scott Tran.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
