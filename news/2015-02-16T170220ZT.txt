b'<p>A PUNCHY MILD CHEDDAR</p> <p>The Fiver is generally forbidden from speaking to the people who work on the fashion desk at Big Paper. Ever since it tried to launch its own rival fashion blog, Fashion Fun With The Fiver, it has been given the silent treatment, apart from the times when its COMPLETELY DELIBERATE decision to turn up to work wearing no trousers was greeted with vicious pointing and hoots of laughter. Even worse, it was wearing odd socks. With sandals. It was unacceptable. The Fiver was ostracised, a social pariah, a hapless figure of fun rather than the loaded and loved editor of Fashion Fun With The Fiver.</p> <p>But then The Fiver read that socks and sandals are so in right now. So, actually, despite what all the haters claimed, you\xe2\x80\x99re actually reading the thoughts of a fashion icon. A fashion icon with its ear pressed firmly to the ground, which is why this is the place to find out that the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading gilet manufacturers have all announced plans to move their main offices to Birmingham, in light of the news that Aston Villa have brought in Tactics Tim as Paul Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s replacement. Tactics Tim loves a gilet. Hopefully he\xe2\x80\x99s going to get a tiger-printed one soon.</p> <p>But that\xe2\x80\x99s enough about fashion for now, especially as Sherwood saw the gilet gags coming. \xe2\x80\x9cEffing hell, I thought it would be two seconds before I heard a gilet joke,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at his unveiling today. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was one!\xe2\x80\x9d Who knew that he was so familiar with The Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s work?So we move on to the football. Ambitious Paul is out and the man who lists mild cheddar as his favourite cheese is tasked with leading Villa away from the relegation mire. In an ironic twist of fate, of course, Villa\xe2\x80\x99s football has been about as interesting as mild cheddar in the past three years, but Tactics Tim is convinced that he can make them more punchy, like a mature cheddar, say, or even an extra mature cheddar. He had a watching brief as Villa beat Leicester City in the FA Cup yesterday and he saw room for improvement. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of apprehension about the place obviously, which comes with losing matches, so we need to play with a bit more freedom, get the shackles off,\xe2\x80\x9d Tactics said. They looked a bit tentative. Let\xe2\x80\x99s have a go fighting and start throwing a few punches ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Naturally some people have been wondering out loud if Sherwood knows what he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about. They\xe2\x80\x99re not convinced by the man whose CV boasts the highest win percentage ratio of any Tottenham Hotspur manager, suggesting that he\xe2\x80\x99s busily pulling off a magnificent con trick and that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got the first clue about management. But Tactics isn\xe2\x80\x99t having any of it. \xe2\x80\x9cI think experience is overrated, to be honest,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are a lot of poor, experienced managers and there are a lot of good ones.\xe2\x80\x9d And as The Fiver has proved today with the launch of its award-snaffling fashion blog, you don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily need to know what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing in order to succeed in life. Good old-fashioned honest ignorance of our chosen subject is the way forward.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT! <p>Join Jacob Steinberg for coverage of Preston North End 1-1 Manchester United at 7.45pm.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI sent myself off. It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to be more embarrassed than that. There was nothing more I could do so I went to the dressing room\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 For a man who stuck out Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s 7-1 thumping by Germany until the bitter end, The Fiver can only imagine the horror show Gremio put on for Big Phil to decide he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay to watch his new side lose their third match in four.</p> AND YET STILL MORE OF YOUR MUNDANE ENCOUNTERS WITH FAMOUS PEOPLE <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBack in 2006 I worked in a bar in Wimbledon Village. One night I managed to spill a beer all over Jody Morris. I defended myself with a rather honest \xe2\x80\x98sorry \xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m just really crap at my job.\xe2\x80\x99 He responded with \xe2\x80\x98don\xe2\x80\x99t worry mate \xe2\x80\xa6 So am I.\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ve had nothing but respect for him ever since\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Andrew Penpraze. </p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOne gloriously sunny Dublin day when I was a wee sprite, I was playing football in the grounds of the Eden pub. There were several people drinking at the tables outside when one elderly gentleman called me over to his table and told me that another fella at his table played for Ireland, and that I should let him sign my ball. I looked down at my bright orange \xe2\x80\x98Cup Champions\xe2\x80\x99 ball and back at the lanky fella being pointed at. \xe2\x80\x98No he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x99 I said, instantly spotting their ruse. They tried to convince me but I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t having any of it. I went back to playing ball before retiring into the pub where I asked my dad, \xe2\x80\x98Does Niall Quinn play for Ireland?\xe2\x80\x99. \xe2\x80\x98Yes,\xe2\x80\x99 my dad replied, \xe2\x80\x98why?\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98because he\xe2\x80\x99s outside and wants to sign my ball\xe2\x80\x99. Under the encouragement of my dad and several other drinkers within earshot, I ran back outside to get my ball signed, but alas they were gone. I later learned the elderly gentleman who beckoned me over was Maurice Setters\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Alan Belton.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy encounter with a famous footballer happened several years ago in the Tradeston area of Glasgow. After a Friday night on the sauce, a mate and I ventured out the next morning in search of a fry-up to mitigate the hangover that was already starting to loom large on the horizon. I decided to stop at a wee newsagents en route to the local greasy spoon. In the shop, I noticed that none other than the former Celtic and St Mirren striker, Frank McGarvey was in front of me in the queue buying a newspaper. As he went to pay, he dropped his \xc2\xa31 coin then watched in horror as it slowly rolled under an ancient photocopier in the corner. McGarvey insisted we help retrieve the shiny nugget from under the weighty beast. Cue us, like two burst couches, straining to lift the machine while the ex-Celt tried to retrieve the coin from the gap with the chocolate slide-rule a.k.a a Curly Wurly\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Chris Collins. </p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI once bought a car from Sven Habermann, car salesman and third-choice keeper for Canada at the 1986 World Cup. It was a 2002 Pontiac Sunfire. The basic model in blue. Surely that makes me the king of mundane? Both for the player I met and the choice of vehicle\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Mark Ireland.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf Jon Gerrard (Friday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters) is going to put together a solid team, he could do worse than adding O\xe2\x80\x99Ronald, Hernan O\xe2\x80\x99Cresp, and perhaps even Luis O\xe2\x80\x99Fig. I briefly considered O\xe2\x80\x99Din O\xe2\x80\x99Baggi, but I think he\xe2\x80\x99s already declared for Norway\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Liam McGuigan.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t believe Harry Markham didn\xe2\x80\x99t win letter o\xe2\x80\x99the day (Friday\xe2\x80\x99s mundane encounters).

Get well soon Juan!</p> <p>And the Colombian side Deportivo Cali were forced to cadge a lift to their match against Deportes Tolima with the police after local El Bill pulled over the team coach and discovered the driver had been a bit busy on the Tin. \xe2\x80\x9cOur squad had to get to the stadium in a police bus after a routine stop on the road detected that the bus driver was over the legal limit of alcohol,\xe2\x80\x9d sniffed a sober club suit.</p> RECOMMENDED LISTENING!      <p>Download Football Weekly NOW!
