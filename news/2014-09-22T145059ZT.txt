b'The Fiver | Manuel Pellegrini, 61, and Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho, 51'


b'SPECIAL WATER <p>With their combined age of 112, you could be forgiven for presuming that Manuel Pellegrini and Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho would be mature enough to shake hands and go their separate ways after their teams took one point each from yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s match at the Etihad. It\xe2\x80\x99s already seems a fairly safe bet that one or other of them is going to win the title, so you\xe2\x80\x99d think, on the face of it, both men would be happy with the draw. Well, you\xe2\x80\x99d be wrong.</p> <p>Apparently annoyed that any team should come to the home of the champions and be so bold as to tenaciously defend their goal and refuse to let Manchester City score at will, the normally sensible Pellegrini, 61, used his post-match press conference to label Chelsea \xe2\x80\x9ca small team trying to defend\xe2\x80\x9d in a tone that suggested this whole trying-not-to-let-your-opponents-get-goals malarkey should be in some way beneath a team managed by a man whose name has long conjured up images of Routemaster drivers meticulously inching their way into the six-yard box to make sure no inch of goal is left unshielded.</p> <p>Pellegrini went on to liken Chelsea to a club that has rather unfairly become the epitome for all that is agricultural, negative and unfashionable about English football, comparing Chelsea to \xe2\x80\x9cthe Stoke team\xe2\x80\x9d who had visited the Etihad earlier this season. \xe2\x80\x9cWe continue with the same ambition, teams will find it hard to beat us,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, evidently not comparing teams in general to the Stoke team who had visited the Etihad earlier this season.</p> <p>Upon being informed of the disparaging remarks made by his opposite number, Mourinho, 51, responded maturely by pretending to mix up Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s name with that of a popular brand of over-priced carbonated water. \xe2\x80\x9cPellegrino? Many times he says he never speaks about me and my team but he keeps doing the same thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jos\xc3\xa9, as a huge lump of butter steadfastly refused to melt in his mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cI am the one that does as he says [not talk about the opposition]. I don\xe2\x80\x99t comment on his words,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, having commented on his words.</p> <p>Asked about the contribution of Frank Lampard, who used to play for Chelsea but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t play for Chelsea any more, to the match, Jos\xc3\xa9 was equally reticent. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t speak about players from other teams, I am sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a Man City player and I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak about other teams\xe2\x80\x99 players.\xe2\x80\x9d All of which gives the Fiver cause to ponder how it is that a man with so little to say about anything can let his mouth get him into so much bother?</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI texted Brede to ask if it was true. Brede told me it was, and that the cheese had to be soaked in alcohol, and that he was told to phone his mother because it would help to speak to someone who loves him while the cheese is working\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 former Fulham player Danny Murphy verifies Daniel Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s tale about Felix Magath\xe2\x80\x99s cheesy treatment of Brede Hangeland\xe2\x80\x99s knack. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to sound big-headed but I am still convinced that German qualities could do English football a lot of good,\xe2\x80\x9d mused Magath. \xe2\x80\x9cSadly, people aren\xe2\x80\x99t inclined to be very open.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel.

Seems a bit harsh (second row back, fifth from the left)\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Simon Lea.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to be the first pedant of the mille cinquante-sept to point out to the pseudonymous Mo Townjunk (Friday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters) that, in pluralising \xe2\x80\x98nom de plume\xe2\x80\x99, the name gets the bonus letter, not the plume, so it\xe2\x80\x99s noms de plume, not nom de plumes. We Fiver readers are always happy to expand our pedantry into another language, and I anxiously await a mistake in Esperanto\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Mitch Abidor (and 1,056 others).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI really must take exception to you awarding letter of the day to the clearly made up Mo Townjunk, who claims to share a name with a Manic Street Preachers song. While being a vaguely amusing pun, I find it cheapens those of us who genuinely do share a name with songs from the back catalogue of the Welsh rockers. On behalf of my wife and I, yours angrily\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Des Ignforlife and Su Icide-Ispainless (and 1,056 other letters from \xe2\x80\x98Sue Narmy\xe2\x80\x99s).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAll these jokes about receiving a letter from Manic Street Preachers song subject Kevin Carter (Fiver letters passim) takes me back to the good old early days of my Fiver readership, and the first letter I ever had published: a witty remark about prior-day-letter-writer Kevin Carter. I\xe2\x80\x99ve searched the archive to try and find proof of my printed missive, but to no avail. Did I imagine it? No matter. I do wonder, though, did Mr Carter ever find a job as a result of his plea in the 6 January 2005 edition?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Philip Smith.</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
