b'<p>Harry Redknapp has launched a staunch defence of Rio Ferdinand as a \xe2\x80\x9ctop-class person\xe2\x80\x9d despite his three-match FA ban \xe2\x80\x93 but warned the defender faces a battle to win back his place in the QPR side.</p> <p>Redknapp hailed Ferdinand\xe2\x80\x99s character, in spite of the former England defender being banned and fined \xc2\xa325,000 for comments made on social network Twitter.</p> <p>The 35-year-old former England captain directed a jibe at a follower who criticised him last month, containing the word \xe2\x80\x9csket\xe2\x80\x9d, which the Collins English Dictionary defines as \xe2\x80\x9ca promiscuous girl or woman\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>While Redknapp said the club are still weighing up whether to appeal, he believes there is no need to talk to Ferdinand about his conduct.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen the FA report yet so we really can\xe2\x80\x99t comment. We\xe2\x80\x99re not sure exactly what he\xe2\x80\x99s done and what the charge is and what the reasons are behind it. So until we see that, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not seen it, we\xe2\x80\x99re not in a position to comment on it.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve not spoken to Phil [Rangers CEO Philip Beard], the chairman or Rio about it. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to sit down and see what the circumstances are. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about it.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRio does know how to behave off the pitch, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not had many footballers behave better off the pitch than Rio, on the pitch and off the pitch. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any problems with the way Rio conducts himself. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t met many classier footballers in my time than Rio Ferdinand, he\xe2\x80\x99s a top-class person.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t need to talk to him about it, not really. I don\xe2\x80\x99t read Twitter, I don\xe2\x80\x99t even know what it is, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to read it and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t interest me one little bit.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Redknapp said it would be a blow to lose Ferdinand for three matches \xe2\x80\x93 though warned he will face a battle to win back his place in the side after the defence performed well without him in the win over Aston Villa.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe lads who played at the back played very well. They were outstanding and I thought Richard Dunne was man of the match the other night. Rio understands that. He just has to wait for his chance to get back in and he has to keep working hard until the opportunity comes.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9c[But] we\xe2\x80\x99re not overloaded with fit defenders, so I want Rio available for every game, that\xe2\x80\x99s for sure.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Redknapp also refused to rule Adel Taarabt out of contention for Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League trip to Chelsea, after the Morocco forward pledged to fight for full fitness in a training-ground meeting on Monday.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe came to see me on Monday and we had a great chat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Redknapp. \xe2\x80\x9cHe admitted he needed to get fitter: he wants to get fit, wants to play, wants to get back in the team, and that\xe2\x80\x99s all I needed to hear from him.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI felt having spoken to him I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to stick him into the reserves as the only senior player amongst the kids, because Sean [Wright-Phillips] wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to play. So instead he came out and worked, and worked very, very hard with the first-team group, he put in a real shift.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m delighted with the way he\xe2\x80\x99s trained, his attitude and I was pleased with the chat we had. He held his hand up and said \xe2\x80\x98I do want to play and I can get fitter, and I want to get back in the team\xe2\x80\x99. If it turns him round and he comes back, shows everyone what he can do, then it will be great.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got fantastic ability, and it would be one of the great crimes in football if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t realise that. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to put him in the squad [to play Chelsea], he\xe2\x80\x99s trained well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
