b'Napoli start to flounder with Rafael Ben\xc3\xadtez facing rotation criticism \xe2\x80\x93 again | Paolo Bandini'


b'<p>Rafa Ben\xc3\xadtez has heard worse insults during his three-decade-long coaching career. \xe2\x80\x9cCiccione! Ciccione! Ciccione!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Verona\xe2\x80\x99s supporters as he stalked the touchline at the Bentegodi on Sunday. It is the same nickname by which Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho sometimes refers to him in conversations with the Italian press and might best be translated as tubby.</p> <p>Such jibes seem unlikely to cut all that deep with Ben\xc3\xadtez, who has joked readily enough about his own eating habits down the years. Naples, besides, cannot be an easy place for any manager to stay trim. This is a city where the locals show their affection by creating a pizza \xe2\x80\x93 well, kinda \xe2\x80\x93 with your face on it. Indeed, Ben\xc3\xadtez\xe2\x80\x99s appetite might have helped him to secure the Napoli job in the first place. The club\xe2\x80\x99s owner, Aurelio De Laurentiis, noted approvingly of his first meeting with the Spaniard that, \xe2\x80\x9cit was as if we had known each other for ever, he made me eat a sea of fried potatoes\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>De Laurentiis was present in Verona on Sunday, attending his first game outside of Naples for a little while. He joined Ben\xc3\xadtez for lunch before kick-off, although, given that the players were also present, one imagines that the menu was less unctuous on this occasion. The owner\xe2\x80\x99s presence was intended to sharpen his team\xe2\x80\x99s focus in the wake of consecutive away defeats by Palermo and Torino.</p> <p>It would have been impossible for De Laurentiis to miss the catcalls aimed at Ben\xc3\xadtez once the game began. Along with his manager, however, he will have been far less troubled by what he heard from the stands, than by what he saw on the pitch.</p> <p>A fast start was expected for Napoli against opponents hovering only three places above the relegation zone. Instead, Verona opened the scoring in the seventh minute \xe2\x80\x93 Luca Toni capitalising on a mix-up between Mariano And\xc3\xbajar and Giandomenico Mesto to blast home from close range. The striker would double his team\xe2\x80\x99s advantage shortly after half-time, hooking Emil Hallfredsson\xe2\x80\x99s low cross into the corner of the net.</p>     Verona\xe2\x80\x99s forward Luca Toni scores one of his two goals in the 2-0 win over Napoli. Photograph: Venezia Filippo/EPA    <p>It was another extraordinary performance from Toni, who will turn 38 in May, but who \xe2\x80\x93 after bagging a double against Milan at San Siro on 7 March \xe2\x80\x93 now has 13 goals in 27 league games this season. He has been with Verona for less than two years but on Sunday became their all-time leading scorer in Serie A, his 33 strikes surpassing the 32 achieved between 1984 and 1988 by Preben Elkjaer.</p> <p>Such a performance would not have been possible, however, without the compliance of a Napoli team who held 70% of possession and yet somehow still played without conviction \xe2\x80\x93 failing to create chances or even properly dictate the tempo of the game. One can only imagine what De Laurentiis was thinking as he surveyed this limp performance, while noting that Gonzalo Higua\xc3\xadn, Jos\xc3\xa9 Callej\xc3\xb3n and Manolo Gabbiadini had all been left out of the starting XI.</p> <p>Ben\xc3\xadtez was presumably aiming to keep those players fresh before his team\xe2\x80\x99s Europa League visit to Dinamo Moscow on Thursday but the decision to rest all of them at once was highly questionable. Higua\xc3\xadn was most in need of a rest, having played a full 90 minutes in four games already this month, but Gabbiadini has only started once over the same span. The former Sampdoria forward would hit the post from 30 yards after finally being introduced as a substitute with less than 10 minutes remaining. It was as close as Napoli came to reducing their arrears.</p> <p>A win on Sunday would have allowed them to close to within a point of second-placed Roma, who face Samp at the Stadio Olimpico on Monday evening. Instead, this 2-0 defeat means they will fall to fourth \xe2\x80\x93 outside the Champions League places \xe2\x80\x93 should Lazio earn a point or more at Torino.</p> <p>If Ben\xc3\xadtez\xe2\x80\x99s project at Napoli has not yet hit trouble, it is navigating perilously close to it. He was not truly hired on the strength of a good meal but because of the \xe2\x80\x9cinternational dimension\xe2\x80\x9d De Laurentiis believed he could bring to the club. Napoli had money to spend after selling Edinson Cavani in the summer of 2013 but a less high-profile manager might still have struggled to lure the likes of Higua\xc3\xadn and Callej\xc3\xb3n from Real Madrid.</p> <p>Those same players, however, will not easily be convinced to stay around if there is no Champions League football to look forward to. Given how deeply Higua\xc3\xadn in particular seemed to suffer this season\xe2\x80\x99s play-off defeat by Athletic Bilbao, even a place in the qualifying rounds might prove insufficient.</p> <p>A top-three finish is not Napoli\xe2\x80\x99s only path back to that tournament, of course. They are presently listed by bookies as second-favourites to win the Europa League \xe2\x80\x93 with Ben\xc3\xadtez\xe2\x80\x99s reputation as a cup specialist no doubt playing some part in that assessment. But to bank on victory in a competition still containing the likes of Wolfsburg, Sevilla, Zenit, Roma and Fiorentina would be arrogant in the extreme.</p> <p>De Laurentiis must shoulder his share of the blame for the club\xe2\x80\x99s failure to kick on this season but Ben\xc3\xadtez, himself yet to extend a contract that expires in the summer, should still have been able to guide a squad this talented to a comfortable top-three finish, even if he could not orchestrate a title challenge.</p> <p>The picture was bright enough in early February, Napoli sitting seven points clear of Lazio in third and seemingly poised to catch up to a stumbling Roma. But after Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s defeat, Ben\xc3\xadtez\xe2\x80\x99s side have now collected only four points from their last five games.</p> <p>Not for the first time in his career, the Spaniard stands accused of excessive squad rotation, overlooking lesser opponents and not knowing how to keep his players consistently motivated over the course of a long campaign. These are far greater failures than that of carrying a few extra pounds around the waist.</p> Talking points <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Does Luca Toni believe that his goalscoring form could earn him a surprise call-up to Antonio Conte\xe2\x80\x99s next Italy squad? Not ruddy likely. \xe2\x80\x9cHe didn\xe2\x80\x99t call me up when he had me at Juventus,\xe2\x80\x9d said the striker on Sunday. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you can go figure for the national team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s game between Genoa and Chievo was supposed to provide us with another window through which to survey the rise of the 20-year-old Milan-owned forward M\xe2\x80\x99Baye Niang. Instead, it became a showcase for the same club\xe2\x80\x99s former prodigy Alberto Paloschi, who famously scored within 18 seconds of being sent on to the pitch for his Rossoneri debut at 18 years old. His career since has been a little less spectacular but it might have been better if he could only play against Genoa every week. He grabbed a double on Sunday to take his personal tally against them to seven in eight games as a professional.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Wins for both of the Veronese clubs were bad news for Cagliari, who came within seconds of collecting three points of their own in Zdenek Zeman\xe2\x80\x99s first game back in charge, only to give up a soft equaliser in the dying seconds of their match against Empoli. It is hard to know now whether the performance will give them a lift \xe2\x80\x93 as well as taking the lead through Jo\xc3\xa3o Pedro, they also struck the woodwork twice in the first half at a boisterous Sant\xe2\x80\x99Elia \xe2\x80\x93 or whether the result will deflate them ahead of the run-in but one way or another, they need to start picking up points fast. They are four points adrift of 17th-placed Atalanta and now eight behind Chievo, who are 16th.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Cesena are in a near-identical spot and showed even more impressive fight as they earned a 1-1 draw away to Inter. But the focus here was on the Nerazzurri, for whom Roberto Mancini finally seemed to throw in the towel in his team\xe2\x80\x99s bid for a Champions League place, which nobody else was taking very seriously anyway. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we had beaten Cesena, everything would still have been possible,\xe2\x80\x9d he protested at full-time. \xe2\x80\x9cNow it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to reach that third place.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Juventus prepared for their Champions League last-16 second leg against Borussia Dortmund with a 1-0 win over Palermo that moves them 14 points clear at the top of Serie A, pending Roma\xe2\x80\x99s game on Monday. The game was not much home to write home about but the winning goal scored by \xc3\x81lvaro Morata \xe2\x80\x93 on his wrong foot, after coming off the bench \xe2\x80\x93 was a peach.</p> <p>Results Atalanta 0-0 Udinese, Cagliari 1-1 Empoli, Genoa 0-2 Chievo, Inter 1-1 Cesena, Palermo 0-1 Juventus, Sassuolo 4-1 Parma, Verona 2-0 Napoli</p>'
