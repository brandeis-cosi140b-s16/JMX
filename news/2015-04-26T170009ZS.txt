b'Sol Campbell: \xe2\x80\x98Are most footballers Tories? Hahaha! Probably\xe2\x80\x99'


b'<p>At 40 years old, Sol Campbell is reinventing himself. In recent weeks the former England central defender has appeared on the cover of Shooting Magazine in lord of the manor mode, bragging about the 30 birds he has shot over the past year. He has powdered his face to \xe2\x80\x9cwhiten up\xe2\x80\x9d for the Operation Black Vote campaign to warn Britain\xe2\x80\x99s ethnic minority communities that not voting will \xe2\x80\x9ctake the colour out of Britain\xe2\x80\x9d. Now he\xe2\x80\x99s hanging out with Boris Johnson and Grant Shapps, helping the Tories in their hour of need, and hinting that he is in the running to be Conservative candidate for London mayor.</p> <p>Today, he turns up at the Guardian in check shirt, brown tie, beige jacket and maroon trousers, carrying a briefcase and a few extra pounds \xe2\x80\x93 he looks more like a salesman than a former footballer. Does he think he\xe2\x80\x99s changed since he retired? \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you tell me?\xe2\x80\x9d he fires back.</p> <p>Last time we met he had not long given up the game. Nobody in the sport suffered quite like Campbell \xe2\x80\x93 even if some of it was self-inflicted. He committed the cardinal sin for a Tottenham Hotspur player: he signed for their north London rivals, Arsenal. Not only that, he let his contract run down so they didn\xe2\x80\x99t even get a transfer fee. The Spurs fans had adored their young captain and never forgave him; he was racially abused, the victim of homophobia (there were rumours that he was gay, despite girlfriends and denials) and mocked for apparently breaking down on the pitch.</p> <p>Few players have divided football fans like Campbell. He was a granite figure at the centre of defence for all his clubs \xe2\x80\x93 twice named in the team of the tournament at the World Cup, a member of Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cInvincibles\xe2\x80\x9d that went the 2003-04 league season unbeaten. He should have been so loved. And yet he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. On the field he was the perfect team player; off it he was a loner with few friends. Despite the success, he felt cheated: why hadn\xe2\x80\x99t he captained England more often? Why hadn\xe2\x80\x99t he been paid the same as some colleagues or more? Why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t he been given so much as an MBE? Why is the football world so scared of somebody who tells it straight? Racism, as Campbell argued, may well have been the answer, but perhaps there was more to it than that.</p>     Campbell with his face powdered to \xe2\x80\x98whiten up\xe2\x80\x99 for the Operation Black Vote campaign. Photograph: PA    <p>So has he changed? He laughs \xe2\x80\x93 the laugh of the new, relaxed Campbell \xe2\x80\x93 but there\xe2\x80\x99s still something intense in it. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have I changed into?\xe2\x80\x9d he challenges. \xe2\x80\x9cOr was I always like this and people didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it?\xe2\x80\x9d He seems to be picking a fight \xe2\x80\x93 but more with himself than me. A second later, he\xe2\x80\x99s agreeing. \xe2\x80\x9cMost footballers are quite tense, aren\xe2\x80\x99t they? So many footballers have been stitched up over the years. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got to mind what they say, be careful about this, careful about that, because something might be misconstrued, twisted around.\xe2\x80\x9d His voice has risen a notch. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the norm, to think: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve been turned over once, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be again.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He loved the game, but not always the people he was forced to mix with. It was an insular, stunted life, he says. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes the conversations were just a bit too low for me. The same old stuff every time. I just switched off.\xe2\x80\x9d Does he enjoy a better standard of conversation nowadays? \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you\xe2\x80\x99re meeting different people. Intelligence is everywhere. If football covers all your emotions, that\xe2\x80\x99s too shallow for me.\xe2\x80\x9d For decades, he says, he never cried. Now he does often \xe2\x80\x93 at a film, an unexpected success, a comeback. His mother died a month ago, and he admits he\xe2\x80\x99s struggling. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m OK when I\xe2\x80\x99m on the move doing stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d But when he stops, he finds himself weeping or praying.</p> <p>Campbell was the youngest of 12 children born to Sewell and Wilhelmina, immigrants from Jamaica, living in Stratford, east London. His parents were always working. There was no time for coddling or bedtime stories. Many of his eight brothers left school without qualifications to work in security or as drivers. \xe2\x80\x9cOpportunities didn\xe2\x80\x99t knock for them. There was no safety net. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m so used to it. Some people need safety nets. Some people need two safety nets. I\xe2\x80\x99ve grown up with no safety nets around me.\xe2\x80\x9d He is close to some of his siblings, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see others.</p> <p>From early on, football was his salvation. Who did he support? \xe2\x80\x9cNo one. I just preferred international football. England, France, Holland, Brazil.\xe2\x80\x9d You\xe2\x80\x99ve always been contrary, I say. No, he says \xe2\x80\x93 it made sense. \xe2\x80\x9cFootball wasn\xe2\x80\x99t around me. We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford to go to football.\xe2\x80\x9d Even when he showed real ability, his parents were too busy making ends meet to notice. \xe2\x80\x9cListen, I used to play football and I\xe2\x80\x99d come home and nobody knew I\xe2\x80\x99d played. Unless I came home injured, nobody said: \xe2\x80\x98How did you do today?\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98What was the score?\xe2\x80\x99 Sometimes I\xe2\x80\x99d bring out a medal and say: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve won this!\xe2\x80\x99 And they\xe2\x80\x99d be: \xe2\x80\x98Oh great, what\xe2\x80\x99s for dinner?\xe2\x80\x99 They weren\xe2\x80\x99t into football.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s what politicised him, he says \xe2\x80\x93 having to pull himself up by his own bootstraps. I ask how long he\xe2\x80\x99s been a Tory. \xe2\x80\x9cOooh, about 20 years. Look, I\xe2\x80\x99m an entrepreneur, I want to create things, I\xe2\x80\x99m a builder. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want handouts. If I didn\xe2\x80\x99t play football I\xe2\x80\x99d be doing something else. That\xe2\x80\x99s me. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be held back. I want to go forward. I want to better myself. I\xe2\x80\x99ll learn this, I\xe2\x80\x99ll learn that, I\xe2\x80\x99ll start from the bottom and work my way up.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s sense of himself as an entrepreneur perhaps helps explain the move to Arsenal. He was investing in his chief asset: himself. Of course it made sense \xe2\x80\x93 he could win more trophies and earn more money. And perhaps the fact that he had never supported a club meant he never quite understood, or respected, the tribalism of football.</p>     Campbell is abused by Spurs fans at an Arsenal-Spurs match. Photograph: Tom Jenkins    <p>Since retiring, he has been working with his wife Fiona Barratt-Campbell (heiress to the Barratt Homes empire) on her interior design business, helping to bring up their two children (he also has a son from an earlier relationship), shooting their supper and contemplating a life in politics. Was he interested in politics when he was younger? \xe2\x80\x9cNo, because it didn\xe2\x80\x99t affect me. When the policies affect you, you start saying: \xe2\x80\x98Well, hello, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Such as? \xe2\x80\x9cMansion tax. Now that would really affect me. Maybe that is selfish, but it is a real thing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Are most footballers Tories? \xe2\x80\x9cHahaha! Probably.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Campbell has a number of homes, one of which was put on the market last October for \xc2\xa325m. Surely he can afford to pay out a few grand tax for that? \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not going to be two or three grand, let me tell you that. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if it\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa320,000-\xc2\xa330,000.\xe2\x80\x9d Well, he can afford that, can\xe2\x80\x99t he? \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not on the same money I was on a year ago or five years ago or 10 years ago. I\xe2\x80\x99ve paid all my taxes up to here. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been prudent. Why should you retrospectively say: \xe2\x80\x98You guys have done well, I want a piece of that.\xe2\x80\x99 Why? Why?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>His voice rises to a singsong pitch of protest. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will cost \xc2\xa3400m to collate all the prices up and down the country, and who\xe2\x80\x99s going to make money out of that? Lawyers, surveyors, accountants. And what if there\xe2\x80\x99s a property crash? Another \xc2\xa3400m to revaluate everything? It\xe2\x80\x99s nuts, it\xe2\x80\x99s stupid, it\xe2\x80\x99s absurd.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>I try to interrupt. Unsuccessfully.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSo, why do you want to base a tax on something that can move? What if you can\xe2\x80\x99t sell it at that price? What happens then?\xe2\x80\x9d His voice is now at glass-breaking frequency. \xe2\x80\x9cSolid money for a solid problem. I want that in there,\xe2\x80\x9d he dictates. \xe2\x80\x9cLabour is basing this problem on: \xe2\x80\x98I want money for that because I want to put it into the NHS.\xe2\x80\x99 Fine. But you are basing it on something that can go up or down.\xe2\x80\x9d Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s wealth has been estimated at \xc2\xa334m. His arguments might well stack up, but Labour hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet announced its plans for higher value houses.</p> <p>Is he in danger of forgetting his roots? \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t forgotten my roots. I\xe2\x80\x99ve given you a proper alternative. Solid money. Change the council tax. Why are you taxing people who are prudent?\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s waving his finger at me as if I\xe2\x80\x99m the tax collector.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSol, this is upsetting you, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYes, because it\xe2\x80\x99s flawed in every capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHas anything vexed you as much politically as the mansion tax?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cInequality,\xe2\x80\x9d he says surprisingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI want it to change.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>My head is thumping with Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s confusing manifesto. \xe2\x80\x9cIn all politics there has to be empathy,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. I ask him whether he became more empathetic after being abused on the terraces. \xe2\x80\x9cI had empathy before, from family.\xe2\x80\x9d But yes, he says, what he went through was extreme. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a lot of footballers have been under that type of pressure, and come out of it at the other end still a bloody effing human being, still having empathy and still wanting to help people. That\xe2\x80\x99s never going to happen to another player again.\xe2\x80\x9d In the end, Campbell went to the police. \xe2\x80\x9cI got to the stage where I thought: \xe2\x80\x98I love football, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t need this.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Campbell celebrates scoring against Barcelona in the 2006 Champions League final. Photograph: Matt Dunham    <p>Did other players understand what he was going through? \xe2\x80\x9cNoooooah. A lot of them were intelligent guys at Arsenal, but on a real level no. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able to handle it. I\xe2\x80\x99m very special in that sense. The pressure I was under, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any other player would still be upbeat, understanding, resolute. They\xe2\x80\x99d be gone out of football, out of the public eye.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Things came to a head in 2006. His father had not long died, his brother John had been jailed for kicking senseless a man who had suggested Sol was gay, he was at fault for two goals in a match against West Ham and the abuse was deafening. As he came off at half time, he saw one of the crowd make the gesture of a gun going off at him. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t return for the second half. He was substituted at his own request and drove away still wearing his No 23 shirt. The next thing we heard, he was in Belgium. Typical Campbell, he still managed to come back that season and score for Arsenal in the Champions League final. He left Arsenal at the end of that season, but then led Portsmouth to an unlikely FA cup victory. Did he think he\xe2\x80\x99d had it with football after that incident? \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I thought I\xe2\x80\x99d had it in England. I wanted to play abroad, and I tried to.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Had he cracked up? \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he says uncertainly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was breaking point. But it\xe2\x80\x99s almost like there was a rebirth. Like a forest fire that burns everything, and then the seeds start to grow again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The sports writer David Walsh wrote of Campbell: \xe2\x80\x9cHe travelled in a suit of emotional armour. If he didn\xe2\x80\x99t give others love, others couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt him.\xe2\x80\x9d Is that fair? \xe2\x80\x9cI had that before I went into football. Football just started to try to pierce it. From very early on I had to look after myself, grow up really fast. Physically, mentally, emotionally.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Interviewing Campbell is gruelling. For all the braggadocio and laughter there seems to be so much buried trauma and insecurity. What about the suit of armour now? \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I\xe2\x80\x99m in a different place now. Different galaxy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>By the end of September he\xe2\x80\x99ll have completed his Uefa Pro-Licence coaching badges, which opens up another career option. But he says if he does return to football, it will probably be abroad. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to start again. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want the hangups. I want my talent to talk.\xe2\x80\x9d He talks about contemporaries with half his ability who have been given good jobs in management. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it a black thing? Is it that they\xe2\x80\x99re not used to thinking of black people controlling a whole team? Do they think they haven\xe2\x80\x99t got the capacity?\xe2\x80\x9d Maybe, I say, people just think you\xe2\x80\x99re a pain in the arse. That\xe2\x80\x99s crazy, he says \xe2\x80\x93 look at the track record. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to ask: \xe2\x80\x98What has he done?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh, he played for England, he\xe2\x80\x99s one of the best footballers in the World Cup twice, he played 20 years at the highest level. Then he goes to Portsmouth.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98Oh, he\xe2\x80\x99s finished.\xe2\x80\x99 But I went there and won the FA Cup. That\xe2\x80\x99s talent. I\xe2\x80\x99ll go somewhere and make it happen. That\xe2\x80\x99s me. If it\xe2\x80\x99s not my day I\xe2\x80\x99ll make it my day. What do you want? Someone who can make your club win the Cup, the Premiership, and has got the mentality. Someone who will spot other players when nobody can spot them.\xe2\x80\x9d He comes to a stop. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe I talk too much,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, exhausted.</p> <p>But he\xe2\x80\x99s not finished yet. He says black players still come in for different treatment. Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s England international Raheem Sterling was recently labelled greedy after asking for \xc2\xa3100,000 a week wages (though some Premier League players get paid far more), and lambasted for inhaling laughing gas, or \xe2\x80\x9chippy crack\xe2\x80\x9d as some newspapers referred to it. Sterling has been treated too harshly by the media, Campbell says. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s one of the most talented English players coming out of this country. Do not destroy him. Wayne Rooney did a lot of stuff, he got some flack, but it was almost overlooked. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been a bad boy, let\xe2\x80\x99s overlook it again.\xe2\x80\x99 Raheem Sterling is one of the most talented men coming out of this country. Wake up. PFA, wake up, press wake up and protect this boy.\xe2\x80\x9d He breaks down every word into its own sentence to stress the point. \xe2\x80\x9cDo. Not. Destroy. That. Man. Yes, he\xe2\x80\x99s young, yes, things will happen, and pay him the money because he\xe2\x80\x99s worth it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Was he shocked when Chelsea fans were caught chanting \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re racist, we\xe2\x80\x99re racist, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the way we like it\xe2\x80\x9d on the Paris metro and refused to allow a black man on the train. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised. They\xe2\x80\x99ve done a lot to stop that, but it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult when you go abroad, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a minority doing that.\xe2\x80\x9d Would you still hear chants like this at English football grounds? \xe2\x80\x9cCourse it does. Just different degrees. Lower divisions, where it\xe2\x80\x99s not monitored as much, people get away with it a bit more.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>This is the real Campbell I\xe2\x80\x99m seeing, he says \xe2\x80\x93 more relaxed, at one with himself, flourishing. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, I\xe2\x80\x99m still a little bit controlling, a little bit guarded, but I\xe2\x80\x99m a much more open person.\xe2\x80\x9d He talks of a speech he made about diversity in the Commons, and how proud he was of himself, and how at home he feels in the company of senior Conservative MPs. What appeals most about being mayor? \xe2\x80\x9cWho said I\xe2\x80\x99m being mayor?\xe2\x80\x9d he snaps. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I\xe2\x80\x99m doing now is helping. Getting people to know me. Because I\xe2\x80\x99m not an MP, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be well in there, they\xe2\x80\x99ve got to see you as an activist, a volunteer, then it comes down to them whether they want you. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to think about housing, transport, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to know what I\xe2\x80\x99m doing. If that ever happened, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be just a mouthpiece.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Campbell says he can offer something different. \xe2\x80\x9cNot everyone can go the Oxbridge route. I think people are sick of that now. People want a mixture. They want real people who care.\xe2\x80\x9d He talks about what he\xe2\x80\x99d like to do for the capital. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to make London greener.\xe2\x80\x9d Does he drive? \xe2\x80\x9cActually, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a Land Rover, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve just got an electric car, too. I want to make London more connected technology-wise, I want the centre to look after outer regions more.\xe2\x80\x9d He stops, worried that he\xe2\x80\x99s giving away too much. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say too much because I don\xe2\x80\x99t want people nicking my ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Who does he think would vote for him? \xe2\x80\x9cTottenham fans. Ahahahahaha!\xe2\x80\x9d The man who caused such a chasm in London\xe2\x80\x99s footballing world really does let out a belly laugh. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, that\xe2\x80\x99s me, that. I want to bring people together.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
