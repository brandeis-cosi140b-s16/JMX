b'Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Brendan Rodgers loth to risk Daniel Sturridge at Chelsea'


b'<p>Daniel Sturridge is unlikely to feature in Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to reach the Capital One Cup final, at the expense of a Chelsea side whom Brendan Rodgers is insistent his players have no cause to fear.</p> <p>Sturridge returned to first-team training on Sunday after almost five months out with thigh and calf injuries and has travelled to London for Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s semi-final second leg at Stamford Bridge. Rodgers, however, is averse to risking Sturridge after so long on the sidelines and is expected to omit the 25-year-old striker from the match-day squad, with Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League game against West Ham United a more realistic target. Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s encouraging display without Sturridge in the 1-1 first-leg draw may influence their manager\xe2\x80\x99s decision.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s no good having the psychological threat [of having Sturridge on the bench] if he can\xe2\x80\x99t play,\xe2\x80\x9d Rodgers said. \xe2\x80\x9cFor us it\xe2\x80\x99s about assessing whether the risk is worth it and, if not, he\xe2\x80\x99ll hopefully be ready by the weekend. It\xe2\x80\x99s important that he\xe2\x80\x99s back training now and the players have done really well without him, recently in particular, so we just have to assess that and see if the risk is worth taking. If he is on the bench that means he can contribute. He\xe2\x80\x99s a top-class player and if he enters the field then we\xe2\x80\x99d hope he could do well for us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Lucas Leiva wants past put right in Capital One Cup </p>   <p>The Liverpool manager said his players would be confident of reaching Wembley and believes any trepidation will come from Chelsea following their FA Cup embarrassment against Bradford City on Saturday. \xe2\x80\x9cWe respect the opponent because they\xe2\x80\x99re a very good team but we\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing to fear,\xe2\x80\x9d Rodgers said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know we can go there and win.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cChelsea\xe2\x80\x99s result at the weekend does not help us. They will have great motivation and after a game like that you want to put it right, but it will be on their mind. Having been 2-0 up and lost, they will know they can still lose Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s game whatever the score is. There will be a bit of trepidation there.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho will pick his first-choice lineup for an occasion he has described as \xe2\x80\x9clive or die\xe2\x80\x9d, as Chelsea seek to make amends for Saturday. The Premier League leaders will revert to their strongest team despite a top-of-the-table match with the champions, Manchester City, looming largeon Saturday. That means players such as Diego Costa, Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas, John Terry, Branislav Ivanovic, Thibaut Courtois and Nemanja Matic will be restored to the starting side with the semi-final tie delicately balanced.</p> <p>Mourinho is attempting to secure the first trophy of his second spell in charge at Stamford Bridge, and his own first return to Wembley since the 2007 Community Shield, with the urgency to exorcise memories of the Cup humiliation obvious.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to forget the Bradford game and think about the next one in a different competition,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are one victory from the final, and it is important we reach Wembley. At the end of May we don\xe2\x80\x99t go to FA Cup final. That is for sure. The FA Cup is finished for us.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t go even to play FA Cup semi-final. So to go there should mean a lot to everyone. It\xe2\x80\x99s a knockout game, a second leg of a semi-final, live or die. Maybe the fact we play against a good team will push us on to a different level of concentration and motivation that, against Bradford, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t reach.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Chelsea manager, who is not expected to include Andre Sch\xc3\xbcrrle in his squad, with the German edging towards a move to Wolfsburg, was furious about the capitulation to League One opposition but remains exasperated by last week\xe2\x80\x99s first leg at Anfield, an occasion he considers to have been a missed opportunity.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was frustrated because Liverpool gave a lot of space,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey play with three defenders, the full-backs are wide, and we could have hurt them much more than we did there. Normally our midfield is full of quality, but we lost so many passes. I saw enough space to score more goals in that game. But, even so, the team had discipline, good individual commitment and the result was positive in terms of a two-legged semi-final.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
