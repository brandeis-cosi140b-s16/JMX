b'Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Oscar pulls out of Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s Copa Am\xc3\xa9rica campaign after injury'


b'<p>The Chelsea forward Oscar has been ruled out for the remainder of the season, and next month\xe2\x80\x99s Copa Am\xc3\xa9rica, after sustaining a thigh injury in training.</p> <p>The Brazil international had hoped to feature in the summer tournament in Chile, which starts on 11 June, but will not be involved after Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho spoke with the national manager, Dunga, and relayed news of the muscular problem. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very sad not to be playing for my country in the Copa Am\xc3\xa9rica,\xe2\x80\x9d the player tweeted. \xe2\x80\x9cThank you all for caring.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The 23-year-old has had a frustrating few months, hampered by niggling injuries and illness, and has failed to play a full 90 minutes for the Premier League champions since 27 January. He suffered a blow to the head in the recent draw at Arsenal, a knock that required hospital treatment and ruled him out of the win at Leicester in midweek, and then suffered a leg injury back at Cobham before the title-winning win over Crystal Palace.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOscar got an injury in his last training session with Chelsea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dunga, who had leant heavily on the player in his eight games since returning as Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s manager after last summer\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup finals. \xe2\x80\x9cWe spoke with [Jos\xc3\xa9] Mourinho and the doctor at Chelsea and his recuperation will take time. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be at his best during the Copa Am\xc3\xa9rica. After the Copa Am\xc3\xa9rica we have World Cup qualifiers, and we thought it best for him to be ready for those.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Brazil, who open their campaign against Peru on 14 June before group games against Colombia and Venezuela, have included the former Real Madrid and Manchester City striker Robinho, who is on loan at Santos from Milan.</p> <p>There are places, too, for Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Philippe Coutinho \xe2\x80\x9cwho will feature in his first major tournament\xe2\x80\x9d and Oscar\xe2\x80\x99s club-mates, Filipe Lu\xc3\xads and Willian. The Paris Saint-Germain trio of David Luiz, Marquinhos and Thiago Silva are also included.</p>'
