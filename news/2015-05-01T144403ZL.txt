b'Louis van Gaal blames pre-season tour for poor Manchester United start'


b'<p>Louis van Gaal has said last summer\xe2\x80\x99s pre-season tour of America is a prime factor in Manchester United trailing Chelsea in the Premier League.</p> <p>His team failed to win the opening three matches of the campaign and after 10 matches United had only 13 points, their poorest return since the 1986-7 season under Ron Atkinson.</p> <p>During the tour Van Gaal stated his unhappiness at the itinerary, which featured games in Los Angeles, Denver, Washington DC, Ann Arbour and Miami, and the manager now believes the schedule cost United valuable ground on Chelsea, who need only to beat Crystal Palace on Sunday to become champions.</p> <p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side are 15 points clear of United, who have 65 and are in fourth position. Asked what the key to bridging the gap will be next season Van Gaal said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe need balance in our selection. I have said this many times. I cannot deny that we need balance. I think also the preparation of our season, Manchester United has already adapted to a better preparation.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have two bases in the US so we are not flying between matches, we are going via bus which is better. They have adapted to my criteria so we shall have a better preparation.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe have started very badly this year. When you cut out the start we shall equal Chelsea but we have to start better. When I previewed our preparation now it looks better but we have to see of course. Then we have to make the balance in our selection better and then we have to perform better than this year.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>On this summer\xe2\x80\x99s tour United play four matches in Seattle, Santa Clara and Chicago in what is a shortened schedule.</p> <p>Meanwhile Van Gaal will have Wayne Rooney available for the visit of West Bromwich Albion on Saturday evening but Michael Carrick, Marcos Rojo, Jonny Evans and Luke Shaw are all ruled out with injury. Regarding Rooney, who had a minor knee complaint, Van Gaal said: \xe2\x80\x9cWayne is very important for us, so I am very happy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of last Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 3-0 defeat at Everton, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cAs a manager I am more than 25 years. I have said after the game it was the first match I have seen it. I have seen seasons with much more than one match [like this] because I have said after draws that I cannot say anything to my players because it was a fantastic team spirit.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen it\xe2\x80\x99s not like that I say it also. You have to accept there is one match when we weren\xe2\x80\x99t at top of our aggression. You will always be compared with your opponents and when your opponents show more aggression you have to show it also, otherwise you are the underdog. That is the lesson. But it normally happens more than once so I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will happen against West Brom again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
