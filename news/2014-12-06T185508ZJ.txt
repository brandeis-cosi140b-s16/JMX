b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho slams Newcastle United ball boys after Chelsea defeat'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has never won a Premier League match on Tyneside and, despite initially declaring he had \xe2\x80\x9cno complaints\xe2\x80\x9d after their 2-1 loss, Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s manager could not resist suggesting this unscheduled defeat had been down to a time-wasting conspiracy orchestrated by the home side.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe wanted to play more football, but it was not possible because of a few things I thought didn\xe2\x80\x99t belong any more to top-level football, but still belong here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe ball disappeared, the ball doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come, another ball comes, the ball boys run away. These kinds of situations that are, unfortunately, still part of the game. But no complaints.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>While Mourinho suggested there should have been 20 minutes of stoppage time at the end of the game, Alan Pardew was nonplussed by the six minutes that were added and Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s ball-boy-related comments.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cJos\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s frustrated,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI understand that, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to give the opposition credit. Jos\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s moan at the ball boys was a bit harsh. Come on, it\xe2\x80\x99s unbelievable. Jos\xc3\xa9 won\xe2\x80\x99t agree, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve done the Premier League a favour by making the title race more interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea have now lost their past three league games at Newcastle, with the first of that sequence coming when Rafael Ben\xc3\xadtez was in charge. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not invincible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho, whose players could not capitalise on Steven Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s 81st-minute sending-off for a second bookable offence. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were unlucky. The best team lost. The team that tried to win, lost. It\xe2\x80\x99s a lucky day for\xc2\xa0Newcastle, but that\xe2\x80\x99s football. Congratulations to Newcastle.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Not that he blamed the referee, Martin Atkinson. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be very disappointed if the first\xc2\xa0defeat had arrived because of a big refereeing mistake or my team being complacent, I\xe2\x80\x99d be very sad. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case, the referee was very good and my players tried everything to win. We were unlucky \xe2\x80\x93 but one day we will be lucky.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
