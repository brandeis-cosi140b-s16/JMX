b'John Carver to stay in charge of Newcastle until end of season'


b'<p>Steve McClaren remains high on Newcastle United\xe2\x80\x99s shortlist after John Carver\xe2\x80\x99s interim appointment offered confirmation of their decision to postpone the recruitment of a long-term successor to Alan Pardew until the summer.</p> <p>Carver, who has served as caretaker coach since Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s defection to Crystal Palace, wants the job long term and believes that over the next four months he will prove he is the outstanding candidate to take it on a permanent basis.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a proud day for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the 50-year-old. \xe2\x80\x9cI have worked with, and learnt from, the best manager that this football club has had in Sir Bobby Robson. I know what this club means to this city and its people. I believe in my players and the staff I have around me. I am confident we can deliver exciting, successful football and look forward with relish to my role as head coach of this great football club.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Caught cold by Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s unexpected exit last month, Newcastle have taken their time to reach this stage. Although Graham Carr, the influential chief scout, championed McClaren but no early approach was made as alternative candidates were assessed. With the days passing, the former England manager pledged his loyalty to Derby County until at least the end of the season, thus complicating Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s task. Even in the summer prising McClaren away promises to be extremely difficult but Carr and company have other contenders in mind.</p> <p>Additional names on a shortlist of figures currently committed to alternative projects include St-\xc3\x89tienne\xe2\x80\x99s Christophe Galtier, Ajax\xe2\x80\x99s Frank de Boer and Thomas Tuchel, who is on extended gardening leave from Mainz. De Boer is understood to have had contact with Newcastle and hinted last week that he could be prepared to swap Ajax for Tyneside at the end of this season.</p> <p>Lee Charnley, Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s managing director, who, assisted by Carr, is conducting the manager hunt on behalf of the owner, Mike Ashley, previously considered appointing R\xc3\xa9mi Garde, the former Lyon coach and Arsenal defensive midfielder. Negotiations stalled when it became clear that Garde wanted to import his old coaching staff from Lyon, who would not be available until June, and there were also concerns regarding his decision to quit the Ligue 1 team blaming exhaustion last spring.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAt the beginning of this process it was my desire and intention to appoint an individual to the position of head coach who would be available to start immediately,\xe2\x80\x9d said Charnley. \xe2\x80\x9cHaving now explored at some length the options available to us at this time, the decision has been taken to defer the appointment of a permanent head coach until the end of the season.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe head coach will be a long-term appointment that will play a major role in shaping the future on-field progression of Newcastle United and it is vitally important that we get the right individual.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cJohn has a long history with the club and has the full support of the board. Our goal for the season of a minimum top-10 finish remains unchanged and we are confident that John, supported by the backroom staff, will be able to deliver this.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Carver, who will be assisted by Steve Stone and Peter Beardsley, is still to win a game since stepping up from the assistant manager\xe2\x80\x99s role he had held for the past four years to succeed Pardew. So far he has presided over a Premier League draw at home to Burnley, an FA Cup third-round defeat at Leicester and further League reverses at Chelsea and against Southampton at home.</p> <p>Although Newcastle are 11th with 27 points, Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game at struggling Hull City has assumed vital importance for a coach initially promoted to prominence at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park by Ruud Gullit in 1998.</p> <p>Carver later assisted Robson before moving on to become an assistant manager at Leeds United, Sheffield United and Plymouth Argyle and, briefly, a manager in his own right at Toronto in the MLS.</p>'
