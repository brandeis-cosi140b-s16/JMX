b'The Fiver | The illusory prospect of objective success'


b'CRYSTAL CLEAR <p>The Championship is the best division in all of football. Intensely competitive, furiously unpredictable and with a serious prize at the end, a relentless cycle of Saturday-Tuesday-Saturday matches allows those who follow teams in it the convenience of scheduled unarguable pleasure, and the potential for a real life as well. Yet, paradoxically, teams are desperate to get out of it, the impossibility of reflecting badly upon Richard Scudamore too tempting a challenge to decline. So, they do everything possible to reach the Premier League, whereupon they endure hidings, struggle and derision, without even the illusory prospect of objective success.</p> <p>The season before last, Crystal Palace were promoted through the play-offs after finishing fifth, lost their best player to Manchester United, and accumulated three points from their first eight games. Accordingly, Ian Holloway departed and Tony Pulis was appointed, somehow contriving, not only to keep the club up, but comfortably so \xe2\x80\x93 a tremendous achievement perhaps beyond any other man on the planet. Yesterday, Tony Palace was allowed to leave Crystal Pulis, because Steve Parish, the club\xe2\x80\x99s co-chairman, thought his needs and stipulations more crucial. That\xe2\x80\x99s the Steve Parish.</p> <p>Of course, when it comes to Palace, this is just what happens; his predecessors in the role form an illustrious list. Take Ron Noades, for example, the first man to try moving Wimbledon to the footballing hotbed of Milton Keynes. In 1991, he prompted the break-up of a promising young side, after commenting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe black players at this club lend the side a lot of skill and flair, but you also need white players in there to balance things up and give the team some brains and some common sense\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>He then sold the club to Mark Goldberg, generously loaning the money required to meet his asking price \xe2\x80\x93 one that Goldberg paid despite the advice of Noades\xe2\x80\x99 own accountants. Almost immediately after taking charge, Steve Coppell, the club\xe2\x80\x99s manager, was made director of football, his position filled by the team\xe2\x80\x99s best player, the non-English-speaking Attilio Lombardo \xe2\x80\x93 and Tomas Brolin. When they were sacked shortly afterwards, Goldberg appointed as manager Ray Lewington \xe2\x80\x93 and Noades. Noades! Palace were quickly relegated, and within two years, were in administration.</p> <p>Next came Simon Jordan, full of promises, haircuts and suntans. Various managers were fired \xe2\x80\x93 Coppell after the two fell out \xe2\x80\x93 and Jordan eventually left the club after it once again sunk into administration.</p> <p>And then there\xe2\x80\x99s Parish: like Jordan, a fan of the club determined to run it as he sees fit. As such, he allowed Dougie Freedman to leave for Bolton \xe2\x80\x93 12 places below Palace at the time \xe2\x80\x93 in a reputed row over contract terms. Then, when he and Pulis could not agree on the funds necessary to guarantee a continuing Premier League presence, it therefore followed that, two days prior to the start of the season, it was essential that the manager leave. Parish, it seems, is an idealist, a purist, and a man of principle; he just loves the Championship.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99m eating cheese on its own with a cracker it has to be really strong. I can handle a strong cheese. Stilton, things like that. If you\xe2\x80\x99re buying mature cheese, than Canadian is probably the strongest one. Canadian extra mature, or Stilton, or anything that really stinks. That\xe2\x80\x99s only really happened in the last five years. Before that I preferred a milder cheese\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 it was tough to pick our favourite from this Michael Owen Small Talk.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel.

I must be as bored as everybody else by this 10-yard measuring conundrum, however, there is a pretty simple solution to the Robert Macmillan decreasing, spiralling string circle paradox (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s letters) that I could not help but write to you about. Attach the string to a small metal ring which rotates around the stick as the referee draws the 10-yard circle, then your string will not decrease in size and the circle stays uniform provided your string is rotated taut and level for the full 360 degrees. Apologies if I\xe2\x80\x99m one of many commonsense geometry pedants but this debate has gone on for too long\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Adam Jackson (and others).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was working a late shift yesterday and had gone to our canteen area to enjoy a suspiciously humid tuna sandwich packed much earlier that day. I was reading the Fiver and got to the letters. The first one of which, by Robert Macmillan, made me bark with laughter and out flew a chunk of part-masticated fish butty. It struck the girl at the next table on her hand. I apologised, but she maintained a withering stare as she pulled out a wet wipe and went to work. Thanks Robert Macmillan, thanks a lot\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Marten Allen.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: referee equipment (letters passim). Stephen Fry recently demonstrated that new billiards technology is able to detect the location of the ball, then project illuminated lines on to the table that show the ball\xe2\x80\x99s predicted path and final destination. Could this gizmo be expanded to the football pitch, as an instantaneous and more accurate alternative for the invisible spray pantomime? Carded players could also be illuminated in yellow or red, though the introduction of red lights to football stadiums may have certain unintended consequences\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Dave Small.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems like your pedant cohort is missing a trick. Let us say we go with the idea of a drone to hold all the gear so the official can sprint about unencumbered. The drone can also have a laser that can be spun about the central vertical axis of the drone. Pointed downwards at an angle it will create a hollow cone of light. If the drone hovers directly over the free-kick-taker, the beam can be angled such that the base of the cone of light is exactly 10 yards in radius and describes a circle around the, erm, kick point. Anyone encroaching would be lit up by the beam. As soon as the kick is taken, the laser is turned off. No vanishing spray, no sticks, no strings, nothing for the ref to carry. Who\xe2\x80\x99s up for a KickStarter? RefDrone 2.0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Steve Hibbert.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cErstwhile New Zealand soccer (like our dear friends in Culturalstereotypeland, we are in a determined quest to be the last in the world to still use the term) captain Tommy Smith is forsaking playing for his country in its determined quest for World Cup qualification in order to tirelessly dedicate himself to his Tractor Boys\xe2\x80\x99 determined quest for Premier League ascension.
