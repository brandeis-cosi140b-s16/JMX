b'Hull City v Chelsea: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened | Michael Butler'


b'<p>On the balance of play, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to argue that Chelsea didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve the win here. But they looked ropey in patches, particularly at the end of the first half. Apart from one calamitous mistake, Courtois was excellent, and made a startling triple save to keep his side in it at 2-2. </p> <p>Meanwhile, QPR have been beaten at home by Everton, 2-1 the final score, with Aaron Lennon getting the winner, his first for the Merseyside club. That\xe2\x80\x99s good news for Hull \xe2\x80\x93 the bottom seven all lost this weekend. They played well, and were rightly applauded off the pitch by their supporters at the end, having 19 attempts on goal, compared to Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s eight.</p> <p>Thanks for reading, and for your emails and tweets. See you next time. Bye!</p>'
