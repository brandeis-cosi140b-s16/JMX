b'Sean Dyche: Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s criticism of Ashley Barnes hard to believe'


b'<p>Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s manager, Sean Dyche, has responded forthrightly to Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s searing criticism of Ashley Barnes\xe2\x80\x99 challenge on Nemanja Matic. In an interview on Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s website, Dyche has defended his player against allegations of a \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal\xe2\x80\x9d tackle and said that Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s reaction at the time suggested the Chelsea manager saw nothing unusual in the incident.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI find it hard to believe all these people who have now come out, especially the manager using very, very strong phrases about that moment, didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any reaction at all at that live moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dyche, who reported that Matic was the only person among Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s players, staff and supporters to respond furiously.</p> <p>Matic shoved Barnes and was sent off, though Chelsea have lodged an appeal with the Football Association on the grounds of excessive sentence in an attempt to reduce the three-match suspension.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPlease look at the reaction from a bunch of expert footballers on the Chelsea side \xe2\x80\x93 the likes of John Terry, a real warrior and a top-class professional in my opinion; Zouma; big, strong boys; Ivanovic \xe2\x80\x93 right on top of this moment. Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has a similar view to me. The crowd behind me, circa 15,000. No one reacts. Live time, no one reacts, apart from Matic. My point is the referee has a chance in live speed time, and no one reacts.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn fact when you look at the footage, when the camera pans back to Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho and his assistant, they are calmly talking about what they should do.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the event with hindsight, with camera views, with slo-mo, now it\xe2\x80\x99s brought out statements like \xe2\x80\x98criminal tackle\xe2\x80\x99. I find that hard to adjust to when live at that moment 15,000-plus people behind me, [Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s] expert staff \xe2\x80\x93 they are all experts in their field, including a high-quality manager \xe2\x80\x93 and most of all the players on the football field [do not react].\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Dyche insisted Barnes had no intention of harming Matic and was trying to reach the ball to pass to Dave Jones.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOnce you are in that pendulum motion to play a pass I think it\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to retract your leg immediately and stop your leg from going through that ball and then rising,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I must make it clear, when you then see it after the event, slo-mo every angle, of course it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look a pleasant challenge \xe2\x80\x93 we all know that. But at live speed, these are expert people who have been in the game a long time who don\xe2\x80\x99t react, don\xe2\x80\x99t even flinch at that moment, other than Matic\xe2\x80\x99s response.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Dyche also responded to Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s other complaints. He said Barnes\xe2\x80\x99s first-half challenge on Branislav Ivanovic, which the Chelsea manager felt worthy of a red card, was punishable with \xe2\x80\x9cat most a yellow card\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s manager accepted that a handball by Michael Kightly from an Ivanovic shot ought to have brought Chelsea a penalty. \xe2\x80\x9cUsually you would expect that to be given,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>But he claimed the push by Jason Shackell on Diego Costa was far less clear-cut. Without accusing the striker of diving, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cJason Shackell definitely gets a mild hand on him. Is that enough for him to go down? It\xe2\x80\x99s a real debate point. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s a close one.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Dyche concluded the interview by saying that Costa had later made contact with the back of Shackell\xe2\x80\x99s legs in an off-the-ball incident and that Chelsea had declined to return the ball when the Burnley goalkeeper, Tom Heaton, then threw it out for another team-mate to receive treatment.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt must have been an oversight, I can only put it down to that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cChelsea actually played on \xe2\x80\x93 threw it in and tried to attack us to score a goal. I\xe2\x80\x99ll accept it if it is an oversight but I think the protocol suggests that isn\xe2\x80\x99t the correct fashion.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
