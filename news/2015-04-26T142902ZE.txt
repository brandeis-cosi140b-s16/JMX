b'Everton v Manchester United: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened | Michael Butler'


b'<p>Roberto Martinez got his tactics spot on. Everton sat deep, with Barry and man-of-the-match McCarthy excellent in front of the back four, and counter-attacked with pace and verve with Barkley, Lennon and Lukaku all exploiting the space in behind United\xe2\x80\x99s attacking full-backs. They were clinical in taking their chances.</p> <p>United had no answers going forward, despite enjoying 66% possession. They resorted to simply hopefully throwing the ball into the penalty box. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t work, and time and time again Jagielka and Stones were able to beat Rooney, and then Falcao in the air.</p> <p>That\xe2\x80\x99s back-to-back defeats for United, they stay in fourth, they\xe2\x80\x99re seven points ahead of Liverpool, who do have a game in hand. Thanks for reading, and for your emails and tweets. See ya!</p>     Not a great day for Rooney and United. Photograph: Andrew Yates/Reuters  '
