b'Paul Lambert: statistics show Aston Villa were right to make a change'


b'<p>The sacking of Paul Lambert at Aston Villa means there have been four managerial changes at Premier League clubs facing a fight against relegation this season and the statistics show why the hierarchy at each may be better served by new men at the helm.</p> <p>Harry Redknapp, who was not sacked by Queens Park Rangers \xe2\x80\x93 resigning on health grounds \xe2\x80\x93 has the worst record, with a win percentage of only 0.83 after 48 top-flight games in charge at Loftus Road. His side also scored the fewest goals per game in his overall tenure \xe2\x80\x93 0.92, worse even than the record of Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s shot-shy Villa, whose side scored 0.97 goals per game in his 101 matches as manager.</p> <p>Neil Warnock, who was the first Premier League manager to be sacked this season, boasted the best goals per game ratio of 1.13 but he paid the price for a defence that leaked goals at a rate of 1.56 per game, an imbalance that caused the team to sink to 18th in the league when the Crystal Palace board lost patience with him.</p>     Paul Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s Aston Villa side conceded more goals on average in the Premier League than any of the other managers who have lost their jobs this season.   <p>Alan Irvine is perhaps the most unfortunate of the four managers to have lost his job, given that his West Bromwich Albion team were 16th when he was sacked and kept six clean sheets in 19 matches but the appointment of Tony Pulis and the boost it has given to performances, including goals scored, has proven the board right so far.</p> <p>As for Lambert, who lost his job after Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s 2-0 defeat at Hull City, scoring goals was not the only problem in his ill-starred time in the West Midlands, he also presided over some heavy defeats. His side lost 15 games by more than two goals after he took over in the summer of 2012, including the club\xe2\x80\x99s worst-ever defeat, the 8-0 loss at Chelsea in December 2012.</p>     The stats prove that both Crystal Palace and West Brom were right to get rid of their managers this season.
