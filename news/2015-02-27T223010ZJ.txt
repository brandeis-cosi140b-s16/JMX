b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho: English football\xe2\x80\x99s reputation damaged by Nemanja Matic ban'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho fears English football is in danger of losing its credibility with \xe2\x80\x9cpeople all around the world\xe2\x80\x9d perplexed as to how Nemanja Matic will miss Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s Capital One Cup final through suspension while Ashley Barnes will be available for Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s game against Swansea on Saturday.</p> <p>The Chelsea manager, whose team attempt to win the first trophy of his second spell in charge against Tottenham Hotspur at Wembley, remains incensed to have lost the Serb for two games after the midfielder pushed Barnes to the turf following the forward\xe2\x80\x99s ill-timed tackle in last Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s draw at Stamford Bridge. Mourinho claimed the Football Association\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to sanction the Burnley player while Matic sits out a ban, albeit reduced from three games, will damage the English game\xe2\x80\x99s reputation around the world.</p> <p>The Portuguese had initially been reluctant to reflect on the ramifications of last Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s draw, but felt compelled to comment when asked about the need for Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s showpiece to pass without controversy. \xe2\x80\x9cI have worked in so many different countries and I know what the Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 what English football \xe2\x80\x93 means in every country,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe dimension of the Premier League: not just the audiences and the millions of people who watch, but the feeling and envy they have for English football \xe2\x80\xa6 the respect and credibility.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFor example, in a very important newspaper in my country, after the Burnley game the headline was: \xe2\x80\x98We thought this was only possible in Portugal, never in England,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho claimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe depth of this message, you understand? This is something English football cannot lose. The credibility in which English football is held has taken a long time to build and will take a long time to lose.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut, step by step, people are affected. These words were not just in Portugal. They were everywhere. We must take care of our football. I\xe2\x80\x99m not English but I have worked here a long time and I have to believe it belongs to me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Asked to expand upon what he considered to be the \xe2\x80\x9ccredibility\xe2\x80\x9d of the game here, Mourinho said: \xe2\x80\x9cFor example, you lose credibility when a player like Matic is suspended, and another player [Barnes] can play this weekend. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can have any doubt that all around the world people open their mouths with surprise at how this can be\xc2\xa0possible.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea had launched an appeal against Matic\xe2\x80\x99s initial three-match ban for violent conduct on the basis of excessive punishment in the hope the suspension would be reduced to one game, only for an independent regulatory commission to reduce the ban to two matches.</p> <p>The club subsequently released a statement confirming they were \xe2\x80\x9cappalled\xe2\x80\x9d at that decision and suggesting more must be done to protect players.</p>'
