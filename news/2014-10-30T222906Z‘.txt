b'<p>Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez has said Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o is on course for a second season as an Everton player following an impressive start to his Goodison Park career.</p> <p>Eto\xe2\x80\x99o agreed a two-year contract when he joined Everton as a free agent in August, with the second year dependent on making 15 starts in the first. The 33-year-old has begun five of his nine appearances already this term, scoring four goals and having a positive impact both on and off the pitch since Chelsea opted against a contract extension at the end of last season.</p> <p>The Everton manager described having the four-times African player of the year at Goodison as \xe2\x80\x9ca gift from the football gods\xe2\x80\x9d and has cast doubt on whether Eto\xe2\x80\x99o would have joined Liverpool had Brendan Rodgers not signed Mario Balotelli in August instead. Indeed, Mart\xc3\xadnez believes the veteran will remain at Everton for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s natural he\xe2\x80\x99ll get another year,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mart\xc3\xadnez. \xe2\x80\x9cThe option for a second year is based on number of games played, so it will come automatically. All I want is for him to enjoy his football and convey the winning mentality he has to the rest of the team.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI always thought his period at Everton would be a minimum of two years because the option reflects that. He could trigger the clause very soon the way he\xe2\x80\x99s playing but the clause is not in my mind or his mind. He\xe2\x80\x99s happy playing for Everton, enjoying his day-to-day work, and that\xe2\x80\x99s it really.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Eto\xe2\x80\x99o produced two fine finishes in the 3-1 win at Burnley on Sunday but Mart\xc3\xadnez insists the former Cameroon striker\xe2\x80\x99s influence is not measured by goals. He explained: \xe2\x80\x9cEvery time he has played without scoring he has been really effective in terms of bringing his mentality to the team but now he\xe2\x80\x99s getting fitter and he\xe2\x80\x99s sharp in one-v-one.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe could have chosen any league in the world and any team just to further his career. He chose to come to Everton because he wanted to be successful \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s it. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t because of any hidden agenda or making it easy for him, or something that would suit his property or location. He came to our football club with no links, purely to be successful and with no attachments. The attachment or link was to be successful.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe brings that winning mentality to the squad. He wants to win the sprints in training, never mind games, and he knows how to control the big moments in games. He\xe2\x80\x99s done that throughout his career. Even just the way he\xe2\x80\x99s been working in training would have been a good enough impact on the club and squad, never mind the goals he\xe2\x80\x99s scored so far.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Liverpool considered signing Eto\xe2\x80\x99o as the transfer deadline approached and sent members of their medical team to Paris to assess the player in the event of Rodgers pulling out of a \xc2\xa316m deal for Balotelli. Mart\xc3\xadnez, however, believes there was no guarantee Eto\xe2\x80\x99o would have agreed to join Liverpool had an offer materialised.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that was the case,\xe2\x80\x9d the Everton manager said of a Liverpool medical. \xe2\x80\x9cI had spoken to Samuel long before then and my chairman had conversations with him some weeks before, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that was the reality.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think that was the real story but, look, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. What matters is that he\xe2\x80\x99s here and I see him as a gift from the footballing gods, and I am happy for him to continue to enjoy it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
