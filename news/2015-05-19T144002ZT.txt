b'<p>STERLING SLIDES</p> <p>As we all know, Liverpool Football Club is special. Different. Classy. Unique. Special. Unique. Classy. Unique. Iconic. Unique. Special. Unique. Clubby. Clubbish. Clubesque. Special. Unique. Increasingly irrelevant. Over the hill. Past-it. Yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s news. Special. Unique. Iconic. Unique. Special. Special. Special. Unique. Liverpool Football Club are special. And unique. And special. And classy. They\xe2\x80\x99re special and specially unique and uniquely specially and specially special and uniquely classy and they have a different way of doing things, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand, you just wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, because you\xe2\x80\x99re not special, or classy, or unique, you\xe2\x80\x99re not Liverpool Football Club, and you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand, so don\xe2\x80\x99t even bother, just accept it, they\xe2\x80\x99re the best football team in the tra-la-la-la land.</p> <p>Liverpool Football Club\xe2\x80\x99s specialness and uniqueness and classiness naturally places them in a position to pat lesser clubs on the head and let them know of their place in the food chain. Clubs, say, like Southampton, who were browbeaten into selling Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren to mighty Liverpool last summer. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have a choice as a club,\xe2\x80\x9d Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s head guru, Brendan Rodgers, roared last August. \xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t have to sell. You have a choice. Maybe Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s objectives have changed. They were looking to be a [Big Cup] club, I believe. They obviously wanted to change. There might be one or two others who leave. It\xe2\x80\x99s just the way it works.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s. Just. The. Way. It. Works.</p> <p>Words to live by. Poetry in motion that comes to mind now that Raheem Sterling is busy letting Liverpool know that the way it works is that he would like to leave in the summer, maybe join a bigger club, play for a team who actually have a chance of winning something in the near future, that there\xe2\x80\x99s only so many times he can hear about the Miraculous Miracle of Istanbul before he\xe2\x80\x99s forced to go all Van Gogh on his ears.</p> <p>Treason! Naturally Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s desire to play for a good team has been met with fury and The Fiver assumes he has spent the day locked in Melwood\xe2\x80\x99s Re-education Chamber, a crack team of Phil Thompson, John Bishop and John Aldridge taking it in turns to hammer home the uniqueness and specialness and classiness of Liverpool Football Club, making sure Sterling knows that he will forever walk alone if he joins Manchester City, a terrifying prospect indeed. It\xe2\x80\x99s just the way it works.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI have rejected Juventus four times: it\xe2\x80\x99s a beautiful pu$$y that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get me h0rny\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Antonio Cassano, don\xe2\x80\x99t ever change.</p> IN DEEP DUDU <p>26 February: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m happy for the affection of the fans since my arrival. To be an idol, I have to win trophies and do things for the club. I hope to become an idol for what I do on the pitch\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Palmeiras star signing Dudu gives it some big talk shortly after his arrival.</p> <p>19 May: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are confident that we will reverse this. We accept and understand it. The court tried to act with rigour, but that rigour has to be with a limit\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Palmeiras lawyers say they will appeal against Dudu\xe2\x80\x99s six-month suspension for shoving a referee from behind after being shown a red card.</p>     Dudu: in deep. Photograph: Gustavo Epifanio/Fotoarena/Corbis    FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs a Leicester City fan, I am understandably in a state of high agogness at present, not to mention substantially over the moon. Still, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to reveal that I don\xe2\x80\x99t hold out many realistic hopes of one day seeing a star or two above the fox\xe2\x80\x99s head on our team shirt denoting a Big Cup title. Or two. Might I suggest there should be different above-the-logo insignia available to plucky clubs like ours to remind us forever of our own triumphs-of-scale, like great escapes from relegation? How about a tiny gallows with a Ghostbusters-style red slash through it? Any other ideas?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Trevor Marshallsea.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: Beeb journos doing hard-time in a Qatari chokey (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Bits and Bobs). Will The Fiver go there on holiday to prove the John Carver Principle? I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what it could prove but it seems like the right thing for The Fiver to do\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Grant McPhee.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSurely the leather inside the gold plating around Lothar Matth\xc3\xa4us\xe2\x80\x99s boot (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Bits and Bobs) will have turned to mould by now? Come to think of it, this was the same man who walked off to a standing ovation minutes before Bayern blew one of the most one-sided Big Cup finals ever. And he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much of a manager either. So from now on, if everything golden someone touches turns to mould, perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99ll be known as the Matth\xc3\xa4us Touch.
