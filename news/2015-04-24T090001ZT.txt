b'The Joy of Six: Everton v Manchester United | Scott Murray'


b'1) Everton 5-0 Manchester United (Division One, October 1984) <p>Liverpool had won the three previous championships, and were reigning European champions to boot, but their main man Graeme Souness had buggered off to Sampdoria, leaving Ron Atkinson\xe2\x80\x99s Manchester United as many folk\xe2\x80\x99s pre-season favourites for the title. A couple of months in, that looked a fair shout; Liverpool had stalled from the get-go and were flailing around in 17th place after 11 matches, while United were stalking early leaders Arsenal in third, having conceded only nine goals. Hopes of that elusive first title since 1967 were high.</p> <p>Nobody was talking much about Everton, despite Howard Kendall\xe2\x80\x99s team having won the previous season\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup and then the Charity Shield, new signing Paul Bracewell slotting into the midfield effortlessly and the team hovering over United\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder in fourth. But the chat started quicksmart once United had visited Goodison. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps the Championship will stay on Merseyside after all,\xe2\x80\x9d was the slightly startled opening line in the Observer\xe2\x80\x99s report, upon Everton crushing United 5-0. \xe2\x80\x9cUnited were not so much beaten as destroyed, their credibility in tatters as their hugely expensive collection of talents came off second best in every area of the field.\xe2\x80\x9d Bracewell, Peter Reid and Trevor Steven were comparatively unsung compared to Bryan Robson, Gordon Strachan, Remi Moses and Jesper Olsen, but they were first to everything here.</p> <p>Kevin Sheedy bravely put Everton ahead on five minutes with a diving header that caused him to clash heads with Kevin Moran. The United defender was still dazed when Sheedy ran through for the second. Steven set up Adrian Heath for the third on 33 minutes, United\xe2\x80\x99s proud defensive record in tatters. Gary Stevens and Graeme Sharp added a couple more late on to complete a rout. United\xe2\x80\x99s midfield, noted the Guardian\xe2\x80\x99s Patrick Barclay, \xe2\x80\x9cplayed butter to Everton\xe2\x80\x99s knives \xe2\x80\xa6 so can Everton win the championship? On this form, unquestionably.\xe2\x80\x9d Barclay was big enough to remind his readers that he had tipped United two weeks previously, but he called it right this time, and early enough to deserve credit for the heads up (Arsenal and Spurs were also big presences in a crowded field). Everton were suddenly serious contenders, and went on to romp the title by 13 points from \xe2\x80\xa6 Liverpool, whose cold start cost them any chance of a fourth title in a row. United ended the season a point back in fourth, promise unfulfilled, a common story in the league during the Big Ron era.</p> 2) Everton 0-1 Manchester United (FA Cup final, May 1985)     Everton\xe2\x80\x99s Neville Southall is beaten by the only goal of the game from Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s Norman Whiteside in the 1985 FA Cup final. Photograph: Pa Photos/PA    <p>Payback time for Manchester United. Received wisdom has Everton as the hot favourites, having landed their first title in 15 years, then the Cup Winners\xe2\x80\x99 Cup in Rotterdam three days before the Wembley showpiece, the latter victory celebrated in some style on the jet back home. A treble was certainly on, but here\xe2\x80\x99s our legendary scribe David Lacey on the morning of the big match: \xe2\x80\x9cThe popular feeling seems to be that United will win and thwart Everton\xe2\x80\x99s dreams of a treble just as they foiled Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s threefold ambitions in 1977 \xe2\x80\xa6 United are the most entertaining team in the country when they find the right blend and rhythm.\xe2\x80\x9d So an Everton victory wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly considered a shoo-in.</p> <p>And so it proved. The story of the match pivoted on two incidents. With 78 fairly turgid minutes gone, Paul McGrath had a pass intercepted by Peter Reid in the centre circle. Kevin Moran threw himself into a challenge, and took Reid out. Peter Willis, a retired police inspector from County Durham, sent Moran packing, the first dismissal in an FA Cup final. Most observers \xe2\x80\x93 including Everton\xe2\x80\x99s manager Howard Kendall and Reid himself \xe2\x80\x93 thought a caution would have sufficed, with Reid not necessarily in full control of the ball. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter the referee blew for a foul I walked away but he pulled me back and asked me to turn round,\xe2\x80\x9d recalled Moran directly after the match. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought he was just taking my name and was shattered when he told me I was off. If we had lost, believe me, I would have been sick.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The game opened up after Moran\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal, though not in the way most expected. Gordon Strachan and Jesper Olsen kept probing down the flanks, their runs too much for Everton, who in the wake of Rotterdam were looking leggy, perchance still a little hungover, regardless of the man advantage and Frank Stapleton being forced to fill in at centre-half. With 10 minutes of extra-time remaining, Norman Whiteside sashayed down the inside-right channel, using Pat van den Hauwe as a shield. Neville Southall \xe2\x80\x93 the PFA player of the year \xe2\x80\x93 was partially unsighted, and Whiteside cashed in to his advantage, curling an exquisite shot into the bottom-left corner off the post. One of the great FA Cup final goals. \xe2\x80\x9cI like to practise that shot in training,\xe2\x80\x9d smiled United\xe2\x80\x99s hero, only just turned 20, after the match. \xe2\x80\x9cThey do not always go in. It was nice to see it come off at Wembley.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> 3) Manchester United 1-0 Everton (FA Cup quarter-final, March 1983)         Frank Stapleton breaks Everton hearts in 1983    <p>So Everton had United\xe2\x80\x99s number in the league during the mid 1980s, but the reverse was true in the Cup. Here\xe2\x80\x99s an astonishing goal, and to be honest a slightly unfair result, in a quarter-final meeting between the two clubs in 1983. United hadn\xe2\x80\x99t lost at Old Trafford for the best part of a year, but Everton really tested them in this game. Howard Kendall\xe2\x80\x99s side put in a performance full of verve and panache, and were by far the better team, Kevin Richardson and Steve McMahon brimming with youthful brio in midfield. But Adrian Heath and Graeme Sharp both missed gilt-edged scoring chances, and would be made to pay for their profligacy.</p> <p>With the game goalless and heading into injury time, Everton had done enough to earn themselves a replay at Goodison Park. They certainly deserved one. But there was a sting in the tail. United won a corner, and manager Ron Atkinson decided to roll the dice. He threw on Lou Macari, hauling Mike Duxbury off simply because he was the player standing closest to the dugout at the time.</p> <p>The gamble paid off handsomely. Everton cleared the corner but \xe2\x80\x93 and we\xe2\x80\x99re now into the second minute of added time \xe2\x80\x93 Ray Wilkins launched a long ball down the inside-left channel. Macari, with his first touch, headed it down, just inside the area, and Frank Stapleton met the ball on the volley, guiding it powerfully with the outside of his right boot into the top-right corner past keeper Jim Arnold, who threw his head back in impotent despair. The resulting roar was so deafening it nearly broke ITV\xe2\x80\x99s recording equipment, and the walls surrounding the Stretford End were still gently vibrating two months later when United were winning the Cup in a replayed final against Brighton.</p> <p>But what a cameo from Macari, who had been on the pitch for all of 90 seconds! \xe2\x80\x9cLou\xe2\x80\x99s stamina is a bit suspect,\xe2\x80\x9d quipped Big Ron, \xe2\x80\x9cso we only put him on for the last minute and a half. He\xe2\x80\x99s in the dressing room now, physically exhausted, shattered.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> 4) Manchester United 3-0 Everton (Division One, 15 April 1974); Everton 1-0 Manchester United (Division One, 23 April 1974)     Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s Sammy McIlroy, centre, takes on the Everton defence at Old Trafford in 1974. Photograph: Bob Thomas/Getty Images    <p>When Ralph Coates gave Tottenham Hotspur victory at Old Trafford in March 1974, the famous Manchester United, European champions six years previously, looked certainties for relegation. They were rock bottom of the table, three points adrift of Norwich City, five behind Birmingham City, seven behind West Ham United and the safety of 19th spot. \xe2\x80\x9cUnited must prepare itself for life in the Second Division,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote the Observer, noting that \xe2\x80\x9ca number of clubs at the top of the third\xe2\x80\x9d would have been above United\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmonotonously drab approach\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>But something stirred. United won at Chelsea. They scrambled a draw against a Burnley side who had just given champions-elect Leeds an almighty belt in the mouth at Elland Road, 4-1. Then they beat Norwich City and Newcastle United. Suddenly they could sniff safety. And when Everton came to town, the great escape looked on. Jim McCalliog scored twice and Stewart Houston the other as United won 3-0. A Terry Darracott own goal, forced by the effervescent McCalliog, was strangely disallowed near the end. Brian Greenhoff and Sammy McIlroy missed easy chances. It could have been 6-0, \xe2\x80\x9cand even that margin would not have flattered United\xe2\x80\x9d, reported this paper. \xe2\x80\x9cAny side who scores 12 goals against four in five games, while collecting nine points, must have a strong belief in their chances of avoiding relegation. That tally is more like championship form.\xe2\x80\x9d United had risen to 20th spot, a mere two points from safety.</p> <p>Ah, what a difference eight days would make. United could only draw at Southampton in their next game. All that precious momentum had been immediately lost. Tommy Docherty predicted that United would \xe2\x80\x9cmurder\xe2\x80\x9d Everton when the sides met again the following week (the strange, syncopated rhythms of the old-school fixture list, right there). This time it was Everton who dominated, who failed to take several gilt-edged chances, and who ran out deserved victors. Their 1-0 win \xe2\x80\x93 Mick Lyons scoring the only goal, diverting a George Telfer shot into the net \xe2\x80\x93 was coupled with United\xe2\x80\x99s relegation rivals Birmingham City battering QPR 4-0. The two results pushed United back down to 21st place, perilously close to the brink.</p> <p>In the next game, Manchester City striker Denis Law symbolically pushed them over it, although it was Birmingham\xe2\x80\x99s win over Norwich that actually rubber-stamped the forms. This bittersweet confirmation of United\xe2\x80\x99s demise tends to obscure Everton\xe2\x80\x99s strange role in it, offering them hope one week, callously snatching it back the next.</p> 5) Everton 1-2 Manchester United (Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, February 1965) <p>Neither Everton nor Manchester United enjoyed their European football very much in the 1963-64 season. Everton competed for the European Cup, and were drawn against Internazionale in the preliminary round (compare and contrast to the spoilt, seeded big boys of today). The Internazionale right-back Tarcisio Burgnich nearly scored with a 40-yard screamer in a goalless draw at Goodison; Jair claimed the only goal back in Milan. Out almost before it had begun.</p> <p>United meanwhile made it to the quarter-finals of the Cup Winners\xe2\x80\x99 Cup, but their tie against Sporting of Lisbon really is best forgotten. Denis Law\xe2\x80\x99s hat-trick at Old Trafford gave Matt Busby\xe2\x80\x99s side a 4-1 first-leg advantage, but United crumbled in Portugal. Two down after 12 minutes, they ended up being thrashed 5-0, all the goals scored by the 54th minute, Osvaldo the hat-trick hero this time. It remains United\xe2\x80\x99s biggest humiliation in Europe (though perhaps they got off lightly, Sporting having won their previous home match in Europe 16-1, against Apoel of Cyprus). Both teams left the arena to a hail of cushions, surely the comfiest celebration in the history of Uefa competition.</p> <p>Two of England\xe2\x80\x99s biggest clubs were therefore in need of some succour on the European front the following year. Only one would get it, as they were drawn together in the third round of the precursor to the Uefa Cup, the old Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. Everton held United in the first leg at Old Trafford. Fred Pickering gave Everton the lead on 14 minutes against the run of play, latching on to a Bill Foulkes miskick and driving home. John Connelly pounced on a Jimmy Gabriel backpass to equalise for United on 33 minutes. After which it was all United, with the Toffees keeper Gordon West the star performer. A 1-1 draw. But United pushed home their superiority in the second leg at Goodison: Connelly opened the scoring in the first half, and though Pickering equalised early in the second, David Herd sealed the deal with 15 minutes to go.</p> <p>Was this match pivotal to both clubs\xe2\x80\x99 European fortunes? Perhaps. United, who would end the season as English champions \xe2\x80\x93 pipping Leeds to the title, their first since the horrors of Munich \xe2\x80\x93 made it to the semis of the Fairs Cup before losing in mid-June (!) to Ferencvaros. Continental confidence bolstered, they made it to the European Cup semis a year later before losing to Partizan Belgrade; and famously won the European Cup a couple of years after that.</p> <p>Harry Catterick\xe2\x80\x99s side never quite got to grips with European football, though. A second-round upset against Ujpest of Hungary in the following year\xe2\x80\x99s Fairs Cup; a second-round defeat to Real Zaragoza in the Cup Winners\xe2\x80\x99 Cup in 1966; a quarter-final loss to Panathinaikos in the European Cup in 1971. Now, identifying the 1965 Fairs Cup showdown between the two clubs as an epochal fork in the road may be stretching a point somewhat. But these results can be shaped to tell the story, if it\xe2\x80\x99s an argument you fancy making.</p> 6) Everton 2-6 Manchester United (Division One, December 1977) <p>We end with a scoreline that made no sense whatsoever. United had looked good under Tommy Docherty since coming back up from their brief sabbatical in the Second Division, two seasons of sparkling football culminating in a memorable FA Cup victory over Liverpool. But during the summer break, the Doc was struck off when his affair with the physio\xe2\x80\x99s wife was uncovered by a prissy board, and United started the following season struggling under the new boss, Dave Sexton.</p> <p>Flailing around in 13th place just before Christmas, they were utterly humiliated by Brian Clough\xe2\x80\x99s newly promoted, table-topping Nottingham Forest, who made a 4-0 statement at Old Trafford. Gordon Lee\xe2\x80\x99s Everton, on the other hand, were in the thick of the title race, sitting on Forest\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder in second spot, two points off the top, and on a 22-match unbeaten run.</p> <p>Cue an absurd Boxing Day massacre at Goodison. United ran in six \xe2\x80\x93 Lou Macari (2), Gordon Hill, Jimmy Greenhoff, Sammy McIlroy and a Trevor Ross own goal \xe2\x80\x93 while Everton had to make do with consolations from Martin Dobson and Bob Latchford. \xe2\x80\x9cWe won it for Dave Sexton,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted Macari, whose second, a sumptuous volley from Hill\xe2\x80\x99s cross, was the pick of the bunch. \xe2\x80\x9cGoodison is my lucky ground,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo years ago I scored with an overhead kick.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Everton lost again 24 hours later, an ill-tempered 3-1 reverse at Leeds, and all of a sudden found themselves five points off the pace. Their title challenge never quite recovered. Latchford scored twice in a face-saving 2-1 win at Old Trafford at the end of March, putting Everton only the one point behind Forest. But by that point they\xe2\x80\x99d played four games more than Clough\xe2\x80\x99s side, and the jig was up soon enough after back-to-back defeats against Liverpool and Coventry City. Everton finished in third spot. United meanwhile ended the season adrift in 10th, their Boxing Day bash having achieved nothing whatsoever. Apart, that is, from derailing the title challenge of a local adversary, the rivalry between these two clubs having quite a vicious edge back in the day, before the modern hatred between United and Liverpool eclipsed everything.</p> <p>Everton would, of course, wreak revenge with that 4-4 draw at the business end of the title race in 2012, in which David Moyes and Marouane Fellaini made quite the impression. But the antagonism just isn\xe2\x80\x99t the same these days.</p>'
