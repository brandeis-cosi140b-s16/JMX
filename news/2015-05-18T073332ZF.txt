b'Football: 10 talking points from this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s action'


b"1) Where will Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s strikers be next season? <p>In Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s 1-1 draw in the final home match of the season on Sunday, Old Trafford may have bade farewell to David de Gea, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao as each player\xe2\x80\x99s future at the club is unclear. While De Gea seems more and more certain to depart for Real Madrid, where Van Persie and Falcao could play next season intrigues. As a loanee from Monaco the Colombian could play there once more though Jorge Mendes, his agent, has hinted the centre-forward will move elsewhere if United reject the chance to take him permanently.</p> <p>Manchester United will also listen to offers for Van Persie but whether he and Falcao can find another elite club interested in them is the big question. The answer, if one or both do leave, may be in Italy where Serie A\xe2\x80\x99s slower pace suits the footballer heading to the autumn of his career. The other part of this conundrum is whom Louis van Gaal might recruit in their place, should they leave \xe2\x80\x93 a poser that is even more of a headache regarding De Gea. Clearer is that the manager is about to enter a close season of transfer wheeling and dealing that promises to be trickier than any for a few years \xe2\x80\x93 harder even than the farrago under David Moyes two summers ago. Jamie Jackson</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Manchester United 1-1 Arsenal  \xe2\x80\xa2 Van Gaal tells De Gea: Real won\xe2\x80\x99t love you like United do  \xe2\x80\xa2 Van Gaal still struggling with United consistency  \xe2\x80\xa2 Michael Cox: Wenger rewarded for adventurous tactical switches            Louis van Gaal: Arsenal cannot \xe2\x80\x98finish the game\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 video    2) Can Hull avoid relegation?  <p> Related: Painful end for Steven Gerrard, Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s superman for all seasons | Daniel Taylor </p>   <p>Steve Bruce has never beaten Manchester United as a manager but anything less than victory against his old club on Sunday will see Hull consigned to the Championship once again. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe Man U owe me something after wrecking my knee and my hip and my ankle,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruce in the aftermath of Hull\xe2\x80\x99s 2-0 defeat to Tottenham, but it is going to be a hugely difficult task for City to retain Premier League status. All Newcastle need is a home win against West Ham to drag themselves clear, while Sunderland require only a point from two matches. That said, if Hull play as they did at White Hart Lane they have an opportunity. They were undone by two goals in quick succession but dominated for spells. Bruce dismissed the Jake Livermore situation as a contributing factor for the defeat, but the timing of the midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s positive test for cocaine could hardly have been any worse. It is all set up for a tense afternoon. James Riach</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Hull City suspend Livermore after he tests positive for cocaine  \xe2\x80\xa2 Livermore has let himself and everyone down, says Bruce   \xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Tottenham 2-0 Hull City  3) QPR can wipe slate clean by turning to youth <p>It has become common practice at a lot of grounds to wheel out former favourites for a half-time interview and there nostalgia was plentiful as Trevor Sinclair and Darren Peacock trundled out to utter a few club-friendly words at Loftus Road. The applause was thunderous as Sinclair urged QPR to get back to basics. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to go old-school and get some scouting around the country to find some players,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Peacock inspired heartfelt clapping when he added his opinion that the club need \xe2\x80\x9cyoung, hungry, ambitious players\xe2\x80\x9d. The message resonated with fans fed up of watching the worst of a handsomely paid yet bloated and unbalanced squad struggle to perform in a relegation season. In the old days that they hearken back to, Sinclair was signed from Blackpool and Peacock from Hereford. QPR want to put together a tighter unit in the Championship, comprising a core of players with something to prove and aspire to. The youngsters given some game time by Chris Ramsey have been refreshing, as demonstrated by the lively second half produced by the 18-year-old striker Reece Grego-Cox. While they will clearly miss players such as Charlie Austin and Rob Green, the standout performers this season in spite of QPR\xe2\x80\x99s position, the club are ready for a clean slate.

It has almost become a game in itself, like bingo with deep-lying midfielders and false No9s. It\xe2\x80\x99s practically impossible to list the different formations Rodgers has used during the past nine months but among them have definitely been 4-3-3, 4-4-2, 4-4-2 with a diamond midfield, 3-4-3, 3-5-2 and, against Crystal Palace on Saturday, 4-1-2-3. Oh and that was a change after Liverpool had begun in a 3-4-3 formation again.</p> <p>While there is nothing wrong with tactical flexibility, and indeed it is a trait to admire in any coach, there comes a point where the man in charge has to form a defined way of playing for his team and Rodgers, now at the end of his third season at Anfield, has surely reached that point. In his defence, the loss of Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez to Barcelona and Daniel Sturridge to long-term injury forced the Northern Irishman to rejig the way he set up the team so successfully last season, but even then there were tweaks and alterations to Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s formation that must have been as confusing to his players as they were to spectators.</p> <p>This season Rodgers found great success with a 3-4-3 formation, having deployed it for the first time against Manchester United in mid-December. Liverpool remained undefeated from then until they again met Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s side in mid-March, but following defeat to them and then to Arsenal soon afterwards he abandoned it \xe2\x80\x93 only to then bring it back for the FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa, which Liverpool lost after the most bewildering 90 minutes of formation changes. Rodgers may well have broken some sort of record.</p>           Steven Gerrard bids farewell to Anfield.    <p>All this tinkering, surely, has to calm down next season if Liverpool are to enjoy a season more productive than this one. The team are crying out for a sense of order and defined way of playing. If Rodgers is looking for a guide than here it is: build the team around Philippe Coutinho. He\xe2\x80\x99s a sensational player.

He may have looked less than pleased when he joined them on loan from Tottenham in January but he has been playing with a smile on his face since then and, although he did not contribute much in the win against West Ham, Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez will be sad to see him go back to White Hart Lane. It was Lennon\xe2\x80\x99s final appearance this season \xe2\x80\x93 he will not be able to play against Tottenham on Saturday. But will we see him in an Everton shirt next season? It seems unlikely that Lennon has a future at Tottenham, so perhaps there is a deal to be done, not that Mart\xc3\xadnez was giving anything away. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you have to ask that to a crystal ball,\xe2\x80\x9d Everton\xe2\x80\x99s manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think Aaron has been phenomenal, a really successful loan period. That\xe2\x80\x99s the end of that loan and we will see what happens in the future but the memories will be there for ever.\xe2\x80\x9d Jacob Steinberg</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Allardyce ponders European dream but fears a West Ham nightmare  \xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: West Ham 1-2 Everton  6) Coates is finally coming good <p>It has been largely a season of struggle at Sunderland for the Liverpool loanee centre-half. Now, though, the Uruguayan seems to have recovered from the serious knee problems that hampered his Anfield career and is showing his class at the heart of Dick Advocaat\xe2\x80\x99s defence. Largely overlooked by his compatriot Gus Poyet \xe2\x80\x93 Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s former manager preferred Santiago Vergini \xe2\x80\x93 Coates had hardly featured until Advocaat offered him a start at Stoke last month. Since then Coates has shone, both when paired with Wes Brown and, as against Leicester, John O\xe2\x80\x99Shea. Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance to offer him first-team chances looks increasingly ill-judged. Louise Taylor</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Advocaat ignores contract talk to focus on Sunderland survival  \xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Sunderland 0-0 Leicester  7) Blessing in disguise for Swans to stay close to home      Gylfi Sigurdsson of Swansea City scores past the outstretched Joe Hart of Manchester City. Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images    <p>Swansea have missed out on playing in the Europa League again \xe2\x80\x93 and what a blessing in disguise that could be. Garry Monk never said as much, and the way that his team approached Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s game against Manchester City suggested they were desperate to pick up the three points that would have kept them in with a chance of finishing in the top six, but it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to come to any other conclusion other than that they will be better off without playing in Europe given the disruption to the domestic season that the Europa League causes. This is not a case of putting Premier League survival ahead of winning silverware; Swansea proved two years ago, when they won the League Cup, that they take knockout competitions seriously, and Huw Jenkins, the chairman, has made it clear in the past that he will not tolerate talk of getting to the 40-point mark. But until the Europa League format is streamlined, and the matches are moved to a Tuesday or Wednesday night rather than a Thursday, it is hard to make a case for being in the competition, especially for a club with Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s playing resources, and that is before we even mention the financial aspect.

In a season in which the Senegalese has blown hot and cold, this was a three-minute exhibition of perhaps why his former mentor told the Guardian, a touch bullishly, last October: \xe2\x80\x9cToday we talk about Messi and Neymar but honestly I don\xe2\x80\x99t think these players are as good as Sadio Man\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d There was, however, evidence to suggest that the Barcelona duo still reign supreme. Man\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s third goal was a delight but his first two were fortunate and Southampton were themselves lucky to host an Aston Villa side, either saving themselves for the FA Cup final or, as the home fans were vocally suggesting, doing their utmost to impersonate the Sunderland side that sunk to an 8-0 defeat earlier in the season. Reaching Wembley and steering clear of relegation notwithstanding, defeats such as these do nothing for Tim Sherwood\xe2\x80\x99s reputation. Quickfire capitulations \xe2\x80\x93 away trips to Chelsea, Liverpool and West Brom (although Spurs did recover to draw 3-3) spring to mind \xe2\x80\x93 punctuated the rousing victories he achieved at Tottenham and painted a picture of a manager who can rally the troops when backs are against the wall but is tactically exposed. He can enjoy the trip to Wembley but Sherwood will be judged on what he achieves over the summer when the chips are not down and there are no fires to fight. Gerard Meagher</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Southampton 6-1 Aston Villa  9) Clubs form an orderly queue for Danny Ings <p>Over the course of this season, Danny Ings has proved himself to be more than a deceptively unfriendly Countdown selection. Though he has scored only 10 goals in 26 appearances, he has shown himself to be a player of enterprise and intelligence, good enough to enhance any squad in the country. At 23, he has many years of improvement to come, is English, and has proved that he can thrive in unfavourable circumstances, able to affect games even with lesser players behind and alongside him. In particular, he performed superbly at Old Trafford and the Etihad, where his all-round game was a constant threat. Very few centre-forwards have the ability to occupy an entire back-four but Ings is one, his presence, movement and touch handy, not only on their own merits but for the flexibility they permit whoever is lucky enough to manage him next season. Daniel Harris</p>  \xe2\x80\xa2 Ings set to depart after Stoke stalemate, says Dyche  \xe2\x80\xa2 Dyche upbeat despite Butland blunting Burnley attack  10) Tricky Redmond the difference for Norwich  <p>It is only in the last month or so that Nathan Redmond has regained his regular starting berth with Norwich City, having shown Alex Neil that he has developed his game. Since arriving at Carrow Road in January the manager has been encouraging Redmond to become more proactive and unpredictable in his movements instead of just patrolling the touchline. Against Ipswich on Saturday Redmond gave a superb demonstration of what his manager had demanded, flitting cleverly around the pitch as he scored one goal, created the other two and generally showed not merely the dribbling skills that he has always had but also astute passing and crisp finishing. Given the way that Albert Adomah performed in Middlesbrough\xe2\x80\x99s dismantling of Brentford, it looks as though wingers could have a big influence on the outcome of the Championship final.
