b'Wolfsburg v Borussia Dortmund the centrepiece of \xe2\x80\x98Englische woche\xe2\x80\x99 | Raphael Honigstein'


b'<p>All told, 2014 has been a pretty good year for German football. Four teams are through to the last 16 of the Champions League, Gladbach and Wolfsburg will contest the round of 32 in the Europa League, the Bundesliga has gone from unpredictable to beyond-imagination bonkers \xe2\x80\x93 Dortmund in the relegation zone, Augsburg in the Champions League places, Bayern autumn champions.OK, maybe not that last one \xe2\x80\x93 and Joachim L\xc3\xb6w, the coach who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t win anything, brought back the World Cup from Brazil.</p> <p>This happy state of affairs, however, is only the prelude to doom and gloom of unprecedented levels, if some professional worriers are to be believed. \xe2\x80\x9cThe disaster is close,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Die Welt a couple of weeks ago. \xe2\x80\x9cThe football fairytale land is threatened by a horror scenario.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The same author also recommended that parents do not buy their children shirts of the perennial winners Bayern Munich for Christmas, for reasons of character-building. \xe2\x80\x9cHow can those growing up learn about the hard life if their club is not challenging them?\xe2\x80\x9d If I understand this sadomasochistic line of argument correctly, that impending nightmare of the Bundesliga going down the drain is in fact good news. We should all emerge as much nicer people in the long run.</p> <p>Welt\xe2\x80\x99s dystopian vision entails big, traditional heavyweights being overrun by less-storied, \xe2\x80\x9cnew money\xe2\x80\x9d outfits from the provinces \xe2\x80\x93 teams like Hoffenheim, second division promotion hopefuls Ingolstadt or the Red Bull fuelled RB Leipzig. Those no-name \xe2\x80\x9cplastics\xe2\x80\x9d, the thinking goes, would depress TV rights values and ticket takings, because of their (mostly) small number of away fans. \xe2\x80\x9cThe whole system might collapse,\xe2\x80\x9d the Dortmund CEO, Hans-Joachim Watzke, has warned.</p> <p>That is unlikely to happen, even if some big clubs\xe2\x80\x99 talent for self-destruction is such that wholesale distinction cannot be ruled out completely. Hamburger SV, aptly nick-named the \xe2\x80\x9cDino\xe2\x80\x9d, can lay claim to leading the way forward - or maybe downward - in that respect, by getting within an Archaeopteryx feather\xe2\x80\x99s breadth of relegation last season. On Tuesday night, Joe Zinnbauer\xe2\x80\x99s men \xe2\x80\x93 14th after a goalless draw with their fellow strugglers SC Freiburg\xe2\x80\x93 welcome 18th placed Stuttgart, the most troubled of this season\xe2\x80\x99s troubled clubs, in a classic six-pointer. Werder Bremen, who are also on their second manager and on the endangered species list, travel to Lucien Favre\xe2\x80\x99s Borussia M\xc3\xb6nchengladbach a day later. The fear is that money, the one resource that has isolated these type of clubs from total failure in the past, will not be enough this year. They are being squeezed from all sides, by poorer but smarter minnows and \xe2\x80\x9ccorporate\xe2\x80\x9d teams like the billionaire Dietmar Hopp\xe2\x80\x99s TSG Hoffenheim.</p> <p>One match in this \xe2\x80\x9cEnglische woche\xe2\x80\x9d, the Bundesliga\xe2\x80\x99s idea of wet and windy mid-week action, neatly encapsulates this tussle between history and new money, between old and new. Dortmund v Wolfsburg on Wednesday night, an unequal pairing of the most unthinkable kind \xe2\x80\x93 Bundesliga football but not as we used to know it. BVB are fighting against relegation in 16th after their ninth defeat of the season \xe2\x80\x93 1-0 away to Hertha \xe2\x80\x93 whereas Wolves \xe2\x80\x93 1-1 at home v Paderborn \xe2\x80\x93 are second, seven points clear off a non-Champions League spot.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe are being told each week that we have a great team\xe2\x80\x9d, a wary J\xc3\xbcrgen Klopp said after the latest setback on Saturday, \xe2\x80\x9cbut this team has great problems.\xe2\x80\x9d Injuries are one of them. The Armenian playmaker Henrikh Mkhitaryan pulled up with a hamstring tear and will be out until Juventus visit in the Champions League in February. Marco Reus will not see any more action in 2014 but the team that will face Wolves will be close to full strength. And Dortmund\xe2\x80\x99s squad, by popular consent, is the deepest one they have had for years.</p> <p>The numbers, though, tell their own tale. The Black and Yellows have scored only 15 goals in as many league games. They have conceded 22 \xe2\x80\x93 as many as they did in the entire season of 2011, when they won their first championship. Their goal-scoring ratio (0.15 for every chance created) is the second-lowest in the league behind HSV.</p>         Watch Raphael Honigstein\xe2\x80\x99s latest Bundesliga round-up    <p>Most depressing of all is the fact that they have won only a single game this season after going behind 1-0 nine times. Is it lack of fitness? A matter of concentration? Or mentality? None of the answers look particularly persuasive. Klopp, the full throttle manager who has always been preaching \xe2\x80\x9cgreedy\xe2\x80\x9d, now-or-never football, has vowed to use the last two opportunities before the winter break to \xe2\x80\x9cdramatically improve the situation\xe2\x80\x9d but deep down he must know he is playing for time. Five weeks\xe2\x80\x99 rest in the winter break are supposed to bring relief from the incessant plight. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to make this fantastic club a present [in those two games]\xe2\x80\x9d, Klopp said.</p> <p>Dortmund should be safe before too long. Unlike the other unwitting contenders for demotion to Bundesliga 2, they have played pretty well, on the whole. But theirs is the most frightening example of the league\xe2\x80\x99s in-built volatility. Everybody thought that three titles and four Champions League qualifications in as many years had irrevocably turned them into the second big beast behind Bayern. If the undoubted expertise of Klopp and the sporting director, Michael Zorc, cannot guarantee lasting success, what hope is there for clubs with much less competent people in key positions?</p> <p>Dortmund lost players like Barrios, Sahin, Kagawa, G\xc3\xb6tze and Lewandowski but they either managed to get them back or bring in recruits of similar or higher quality. And even if Lewandowski\xe2\x80\x99s transfer to Bavaria has hurt more than others in a tactical sense, that goes only so far in explaining why Dortmund convert only a fraction of the opportunities they regularly create.</p> <p>Wolves, with the joint second-best attack (29 goals), are at the opposite end of the scale. Their Volkswagen-backed success is, of course, being dismissed as somewhat artificial by Dortmund fans and other traditionalists but the moral high-ground does not come with any points, unfortunately. Dieter Hecking\xe2\x80\x99s men will relish the capacity to stick the knife in a little further at the Signal Iduna Park, in retaliation to Watzke\xe2\x80\x99s comments about the league not needing any more \xe2\x80\x9ccompany teams\xe2\x80\x9d from last year. \xe2\x80\x9cMr Watzke is not lacking for confidence,\xe2\x80\x9d the Wolfsburg sporting director, Klaus Allofs, wryly replied at the time.</p> <p>There is also the ex-factor subtext \xe2\x80\x93 midfielder Ivan Perisic, who never quite delivered at Dortmund, has become one of the league\xe2\x80\x99s best players \xe2\x80\x93 and the big what- might-have-been question mark hanging over Kevin de Bruyne\xe2\x80\x99s strawberry blond head. The Belgium international had agreed terms with BVB to move from Chelsea in the summer of 2013 but Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho vetoed the transfer \xe2\x80\x93 the Portuguese was allegedly angry that the Bundesliga club were unwilling to sell him Lewandowski. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what my agent told me,\xe2\x80\x9d De Bruyne said in an interview with Sport-Bild last March. The 23-year-old has been superb this season, especially when it comes to putting goals on a platter, in nice bite-size chunks, for his strike partners. How Dortmund could do with somebody making the right decisions in front of goal at the moment.</p> <p>As a game, it should make for an enthralling spectacle, with added layers of meaning for extra resonance. Dortmund (16th) v Wolfsburg (2nd) is more than a fixture. It is shorthand for the upside-down league of 17 below the currently untouchable Bayern and quite possibly for the big cultural clash that will come to define the next years too.</p> <p>Results: Hoffenheim 3-2 Frankfurt, Augsburg 0-4 Bayern, Freiburg 0-0 Hamburg, Hertha 1-0 Dortmund, Bremen 3-3 Hannover, Schalke 1-2 K\xc3\xb6ln, Mainz 1-1 Stuttgart, Leverkusen 1-1 Gladbach, Wolfsburg 1-1 Paderborn.</p>'
