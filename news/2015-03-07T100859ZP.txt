b'Papiss Ciss\xc3\xa9 handed seven-match ban, Jonny Evans gets six-game suspension for spitting'


b'<p>Manchester United are on a collision course with the Football Association after the governing body refused to accept Jonny Evans\xe2\x80\x99s denial that he spat at Newcastle United\xe2\x80\x99s Papiss Ciss\xc3\xa9.</p> <p>The United centre-half was on Saturday handed an automatic six-match suspension \xe2\x80\x93 mandatory for the offence under Uefa\xe2\x80\x99s rule book \xe2\x80\x93 after an independent regulatory commission was convened on Friday night and upheld the FA\xe2\x80\x99s charge. Much to United\xe2\x80\x99s chagrin there is no right of appeal in such cases.</p> <p>Ciss\xc3\xa9 had already pleaded guilty and apologised for the incident at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park on Wednesday night, but the Senegal striker received a seven-match ban as he had been charged with violent conduct earlier this season when retrospective video evidence caught him elbowing Everton\xe2\x80\x99s S\xc3\xa9amus Coleman.</p> <p>Evans issued a statement on Thursday \xe2\x80\x93 endorsed by Louis van Gaal \xe2\x80\x93 maintaining he \xe2\x80\x9cwould never spit at a fellow professional\xe2\x80\x9d. While being careful not to deny that he did spit, the defender was adamant he did not aim it at Ciss\xc3\xa9 but the independent regulatory commission evidently thought otherwise.</p> <p>Van Gaal will know the loss of Evans, a key component of his often less than convincing defence, is hardly going to enhance Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League ambitions. If the Dutchman is unlikely to be left quite as publicly apoplectic as Sir Alex Ferguson might have been in similar circumstances, Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s sense of grievance about the FA\xe2\x80\x99s fast-track system of justice should not be underestimated. If United fail to finish the campaign in the top four and miss out on involvement in next season\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League, the repercussions of Wednesday night\xe2\x80\x99s confrontation can expect to be cited, repeatedly, in mitigation.</p> <p>Like Anthony Taylor, the referee, Van Gaal and Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s head coach, John Carver, did not see an incident picked up by powerful television camera lenses. While close examination of the video images proves that Ciss\xc3\xa9 spat at Evans in retaliation for what he perceived as the defender spitting at him, the evidence of the Northern Irishman\xe2\x80\x99s culpability is arguably rather less conclusive.</p> <p>While it is clear spittle left his mouth, it is possible to argue that it was a reflex gesture aimed at the ground rather than the Newcastle player. Yet with no appeal mechanism available to United such theories are rather academic as they prepare for life without Evans in not only Monday night\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup quarter-final against Arsenal but Premier League games against Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool, Aston Villa and Manchester City. The final game of his suspension will be either an FA Cup semi-final or a league trip to Chelsea.</p> <p>Considering that a dangerous tackle capable of ending a career or leaving its victim requiring surgery followed by months of rehabilitation usually attracts nothing more than a three-game ban the harshness of Evans\xe2\x80\x99s punishment seems bound to provoke considerable debate.</p> <p>Ciss\xc3\xa9, meanwhile, will be unavailable for Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s matches with Everton, Arsenal, Sunderland, Liverpool, Tottenham, Swansea and Leicester. Carver will be disappointed that his No9 must sit out the Wear-Tyne derby at Sunderland on 5 April. Instead he must rely on the gifted but inexperienced Ayoze P\xc3\xa9rez, the unproven Emmanuel Rivi\xc3\xa8re and the untested youngster Adam Armstrong.</p>  <p> Related: Stoke\xe2\x80\x99s Jonathan Walters says that spitting is \xe2\x80\x98the lowest of the low\xe2\x80\x99 </p> '
