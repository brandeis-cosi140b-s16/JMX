b'Scots face women\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup play-off but England beat Montenegro 10-0'


b'<p>Scotland will have to go through play-offs to join England at next year\xe2\x80\x99s women\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup finals in Canada after losing their final qualifier 2-0 to Sweden.</p> <p>On the final day of group games England, already qualified, completed their campaign with a 10-0 thrashing of Montenegro and a 100% record. Wales, in the same group as England, went into their last game needing to beat Ukraine to finish runners-up and possibly earn a play-off place, depending on results in other groups, but they were beaten 1-0 in Lviv.</p> <p>Scotland kicked off in Gothenburg with a play-off place assured but with the possibility of reaching the finals of a major tournament for the first time by winning 3-1 or better. They were three points behind Sweden, the group leaders, but with a superior goal difference, so, with head-to-head results the decider should two teams finish level at the top of the group, avenging their 3-1 home defeat by the Swedes would have done the trick for Anna Signeul\xe2\x80\x99s team.</p> <p>However, it was a tall order that became even taller when the winger Therese Sjogran gave Sweden a seventh-minute lead. Although Scotland pressed for goals in the second half and went close on several occasions, the striker Lotta Schelin\xe2\x80\x99s 76th-minute goal proved decisive.</p> <p>Signeul, the Swedish coach who has impressively led Scotland to qualifying play-offs in each of the last two European Championships, said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a tough ask but we gave it a go. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t create enough in the first half but we were unlucky not to get a goal or two in the second half. We are not dejected, though, we have proved during this campaign that we are a team to be reckoned with and we will be going into the play-offs with confidence. We got very close in both of the Euro play-offs we contested and we will be aiming to go all the way this time.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>England\xe2\x80\x99s 10-0 stroll in Petrovac took the goal aggregate of Mark Sampson\xe2\x80\x99s team to 52-1 in their 10 group matches.</p> <p>In what was the national team\xe2\x80\x99s biggest victory since their record 13-0 mauling of Hungary nine years ago, the Chelsea striker Eniola Aluko hit a hat-trick and there were doubles for the Birmingham City playmaker Karen Carney and the Manchester City striker Toni Duggan, plus a goal apiece for the Liverpool central defender Lucy Bronze, the Everton left-back Alex Greenwood and the Birmingham midfielder Jo Potter.</p> <p>Sampson, the head coach, said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a positive, thoroughly professional performance with clinical finishing and it completed a good job well done in qualifying. The team has developed really well during the course of the campaign and we should be in a good place when the finals come round next June.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Wales\xe2\x80\x99 hopes of finishing runners-up to England were ended by a 61st-minute goal from Tetyana Romanenko. The head coach, Jarmo Matikainen, said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a very close game that we might have won. We were the better team in the first half and created chances but unfortunately we could not get a goal.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very proud of the team, though, in the way they have progressed. It has been the country\xe2\x80\x99s best-ever qualifying campaign and to come so far as to be seriously fighting for a play-off place for the World Cup finals is a great achievement.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Wales\xe2\x80\x99 exit has brought to an end the four-year tenure of Matikainen, who announced nine months ago that he would be leaving his post to return to work in his native Finland but said that he would stay on to manage the side through to whenever their World Cup hopes were over.</p> <p>Matikainen, under whom Wales have climbed 13 places to 37th in the world rankings, said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt has been fantastic to work with these players, a real privilege. In that respect this is a sad day for me but I wish everyone connected with the Welsh women\xe2\x80\x99s game the very best for the future.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
