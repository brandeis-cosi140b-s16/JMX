b'Harry Redknapp\xe2\x80\x99s angst a problem for Tony Fernandes and QPR | David Hytner'


b'<p>Harry Redknapp does get down. He does get introspective and horribly gloomy. Defeat has always done this to him and, after 31 years in football management, it is not getting any easier. Monday was a black day for the Queens Park Rangers manager and so was Sunday, when his team lost 2-0 at West Ham United, his former club, to sit bottom of the Premier League table.</p> <p>Redknapp\xe2\x80\x99s soul-searching had a plaintive edge. He sounded fed up. At the age of 67 he appeared to be asking whether he still needed it \xe2\x80\x93 the 5.30am starts to get himself from Poole to London for training, the battles with his dodgy knee, the general aggro?</p> <p>Redknapp is into the final year of his QPR contract and, according to him, he does not want to sign a new one, despite the willingness of the club\xe2\x80\x99s chairman, Tony Fernandes, to tie him down for a little longer. Redknapp said that his future depended on whether QPR stayed up. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll see where we are come next May,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cI may have had enough by then and so might the people that run the club.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Redknapp will doubtless bounce back. He usually does. His ills are nothing that a thumping victory would not cure, even if he will have to wait until Sunday week for his next shot at one. QPR face Liverpool at Loftus Road after the international break and, thereafter, their fixtures are Aston Villa (home), Chelsea (away) and Manchester City (home). It does not get any easier.</p> <p>Redknapp will use the international break to regroup and to attempt to bolster the fitness levels of his players, some of whom are not 100% after recent injuries. He hopes to arrange a behind-closed-doors match to help the process.</p> <p>There has also been a new signing, with Les Ferdinand returning to the club where he made his name as a barnstorming centre-forward. He has been appointed as head of football operations, with the brief to coach at all levels from the academy upwards and to seek to improve the club\xe2\x80\x99s footballing philosophy. Redknapp previously brought Ferdinand on to the coaching staff at his former club, Tottenham Hotspur.</p> <p>But Redknapp\xe2\x80\x99s angst and the uncertain future of which he speaks is not a good look and it is impossible to ignore the uneasy sense of deja vu. This is Fernandes\xe2\x80\x99s third season in Premier League football after he assumed majority control of QPR in August 2011, and the first two featured poor results and headache-inducing problems, with the biggest one being whether to keep faith with the manager.</p> <p>In 2011-12, with the team one point above the relegation places in early January, Fernandes sacked Neil Warnock and replaced him with Mark Hughes. They stayed up \xe2\x80\x93 by one point. In 2012-13, following the worst start to a top-flight campaign in the club\xe2\x80\x99s history (no wins and four points from 12 matches), Fernandes sacked Hughes and replaced him with Redknapp. They went down.</p> <p>Fernandes has been keen to talk up the promotion campaign from the Championship under Redknapp, when they edged to a fortunate victory over Derby County in the play-off final, and he is entitled to ask, as he has done on Twitter, how many other clubs have won immediate promotion back into the Premier League. Or, indeed, where many of the relegated clubs now find themselves. QPR became only the 17th team to come straight back up since the inception of the Premier League in 1992-93.</p> <p>But here we are again, with QPR struggling at the wrong end of the table, the problems seemingly everywhere and Fernandes potentially approaching the point where he has to consider whether to stick or twist with the manager. It is clear that Fernandes loves Redknapp. He considers him to be a friend, as well as a manager he respects and there is little he would want more than to see Redknapp lead QPR to the target of Premier League consolidation. Fernandes might already have considered making the change if it were anyone other than Redknapp.</p> <p>The subject of the manager\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal is not on Fernandes\xe2\x80\x99 agenda at the moment but there could well come a time when it is. The issue of Fernandes\xe2\x80\x99 loyalty stands to offer an interesting dynamic. He is on record as saying that he ought to have sacked Hughes sooner, that he was effectively too loyal to him.</p> <p>Redknapp is, at least, working with a more spirited squad than the one that was riven by splits and infighting under Hughes. One of Redknapp\xe2\x80\x99s strong points is his ability to sign characters and mould a strong dressing room. It also has to be remembered that the season is only seven games old.</p> <p>But backs have been pressed to the wall and the questions are unforgiving. Redknapp spent most of pre-season working on a 3-5-2 formation and he signed players for the system, including the wing-back, Mauricio Isla, from Juventus on loan. But Redknapp ditched it after two games. Has he wasted time and money? Isla is not as comfortable as a more defensively minded full-back in a back four.</p> <p>Then, there was the Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my situation. It was obvious that the France World Cup striker wanted to leave and as his contract contained a buy-out clause, QPR were vulnerable. But they struggled to line up a replacement of similar calibre and they were left to lament what Fernandes has described as a \xe2\x80\x9chuge, huge blow\xe2\x80\x9d when Chelsea took him just before the transfer deadline. Redknapp\xe2\x80\x99s options up front are slim and the shortage of goals has been one of the biggest problems. They have only four so far.</p> <p>The club reported pre-tax losses of \xc2\xa365.4m for the year ended May 2013 and they are working against the threat of sanctions from the Football League for a possible breach of financial fair play regulations during their season in the Championship last time out.</p> <p>At present, it is merely assumed that the club will have exceeded the limits, based on their previous financial results and the fact that they did not, or were unable to, cut back in the Championship. It is a fairly solid assumption. QPR must submit their results for the year ended May 2014 by 1\xc2\xa0December.</p> <p>Fernandes has promised to fight any punishment that the Football League mete out and which they would be confident of chasing even while QPR are in the Premier League and, technically, out of their jurisdiction.</p> <p>When Fernandes took over at Loftus Road he talked of the club as a \xe2\x80\x9crough diamond\xe2\x80\x9d that he intended to polish into a \xe2\x80\x9cdiamond\xe2\x80\x9d. He continues to hope that they can build a larger stadium at Old Oak, although that will be a protracted process, with no move likely for nine or 10 years at best. There is also opposition to QPR\xe2\x80\x99s plans for the site from Cargiant, the current occupiers, who reportedly are planning to use the 45-acre area for commercial and residential purposes.</p> <p>Fernandes is one of the game\xe2\x80\x99s most likeable characters. Open, honest and enthusiastic, he is a dreamer of big dreams. The stars must seem a long way away.</p>'
