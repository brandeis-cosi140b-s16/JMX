b'Leicester City v Sunderland: match preview'


b'<p>While not yet a relegation six-pointer, this game may have a hand in determining which of the two teams stays in the Premier League. Leicester entertain Sunderland having lost four of their past five league games in poor fashion. They will need striker Leonardo Ulloa, who has not netted since September, to regain the golden touch that saw him score freely earlier in the season. A Sunderland win will do much to boost morale in Gus Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s side before fixtures against Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool.
