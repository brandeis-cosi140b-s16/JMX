b'Chelsea v Sunderland: match preview'


b'<p>These sides have met their season\xe2\x80\x99s objectives, which should transform Stamford Bridge into something of a celebration. Dick Advocaat\xe2\x80\x99s achievement in retaining Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s top flight status should be lauded. Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho, the manager of the season, would have preferred to have hoisted the silverware after the victory over Crystal Palace earlier this month but will still savour the moment as he flings more youngsters into the fray to gain experience. He pinpointed the 5-3 defeat at Tottenham on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day as psychologically important for his team. They have not looked back since.
