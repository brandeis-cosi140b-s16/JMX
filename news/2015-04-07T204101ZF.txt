b'Fiorentina 0-3 Juventus: Italian Cup semi-final, second leg \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s all from me. A hugely impressive performance from Juve.</p> <p>Without three of their best - Pirlo, Pogba and Tevez - Massimiliano Allegri\xe2\x80\x99s team pulled off a hugely impressive comeback to win 4-2 on aggregate and stay on course for a domestic double, and a first Coppa Italia in 20 years. </p> <p>Fiorentina will be bitterly disappointed with their timid performance in the first half. You can\xe2\x80\x99t help but feel that Vincenzo Montella - as handsome as he surely is - may have got his tactics slightly wrong, hoping to cling on to that lead from the first leg when it may have been better had they played their natural game. </p> <p>Too late now though, and La Viola must push on for a top-three place to earn Champions League football for next season. </p>'
