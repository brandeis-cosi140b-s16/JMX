b'Vincenzo Montella has Fiorentina flying high ahead of season\xe2\x80\x99s decisive moment | James Riach'


b'<p>Much has been made of Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s make-or-break double-header this week \xe2\x80\x93 crucial back-to-back games against Fiorentina and Chelsea \xe2\x80\x93 yet for La Viola this is also a decisive moment of the season.</p> <p>The same question has been levelled at both Mauricio Pochettino and Vincenzo Montella in recent weeks, before Thursday night\xe2\x80\x99s meeting between the sides at Stadio Artemio Franchi: what is the best way of securing Champions League qualification this year: through the Premier League and Serie A respectively, or via success in the Europa League?</p> <p>Each manager has responded diplomatically \xe2\x80\x93 that the next game is the most important, that both opportunities must be viewed equally. Yet it is a legitimate debate given the strains that a long run in Europe\xe2\x80\x99s second tier tournament can have on a domestic campaign.</p>     Vincenzo Montella scoring for Fulham with his trademark aeroplane celebration. Photograph: SANG TAN/AP    <p>Pochettino has already conceded that his team selection this week could decide the fate of Spurs\xe2\x80\x99 whole season. Similarly for Montella, a man whose stock in Italian football is currently high, this is a seminal period in his burgeoning managerial career.</p> <p>L\xe2\x80\x99aeroplanino - or \xe2\x80\x9cthe little aeroplane\xe2\x80\x9d, as he was known \xe2\x80\x93 has yet to win a title as a coach, although his time with Catania in 2011/12 proved a major success \xe2\x80\x93 he led the Sicilian club to an 11th place finish \xe2\x80\x93 and Fiorentina have progressed under his stewardship. Last season the side were defeated in the final of the Coppa Italia by Napoli and finished fourth in Serie A, but there is a chance to improve this year.</p> <p>Montella\xe2\x80\x99s team currently sit fifth in the league, six points behind third, and face the leaders Juventus in the semi-final first leg of the Coppa Italia next Thursday. Fiorentina have everything to play for yet, like Tottenham, all avenues could be closed in a matter of days should their form dip. It would be a surprise, though, given that they are unbeaten in 10 matches.</p> <p>Montella, the former Italy striker who made his name with Roma and enjoyed a brief stint in the Premier League with Fulham, arguably has the upper hand going into Thursday night\xe2\x80\x99s game. Fiorentina were on the ropes after half an hour at White Hart Lane last week but the coach switched from a 3-5-1-1 formation to four at the back, a move that turned the tie in his side\xe2\x80\x99s favour.</p> <p>Fiorentina have the away goal and looked comfortable playing out the last 20 minutes in north London, with Spurs barely able to craft a scoring opportunity despite Harry Kane\xe2\x80\x99s second-half introduction. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need more concentration, the same intensity and bravery that we showed in London,\xe2\x80\x9d said Montella ahead of the second leg. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we need to be more clinical in front of goal with the last pass.\xe2\x80\x9d Asked if his side could play for a draw, given that 0-0 would allow Fiorentina to advance, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to play to win the game, that\xe2\x80\x99s in our characteristic.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As a player Montella spent 10 years with the Giallorossi and earned 20 caps for the Azzurri, scoring three times including a memorable double at Elland Road during a 2-1 victory for Italy in the build-up for the 2002 World Cup, a tournament at which he earned a place in Giovanni Trapattoni\xe2\x80\x99s squad.</p> <p>As a coach, he has already been linked with Rafa Ben\xc3\xadtez\xe2\x80\x99s job at Napoli should the Spaniard depart, despite having yet to win a major piece of silverware.</p> <p>Montella has shown a willingness to sign players with playing time in English football. Fiorentina\xe2\x80\x99s squad has an abundance of Premier League experience, with Micah Richards and Mohamed Salah on loan from Manchester City and Chelsea respectively, while others include Marcos Alonso, Stefan Savic, Borja Valero and Alberto Aquilani.</p> <p>Montella stated this was a coincidence rather than a specific plan, but on comparisons between English and Italian football, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cThey are two different leagues, it is more tactical here and less physical compared to the Premier League, where there is more power, more physical characteristics on the pitch. In Italy we probably don\xe2\x80\x99t show this same level in the 90 minutes but we have to control the game more over the 90 minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Spurs\xe2\x80\x99 pace and width caused havoc for 30 minutes last week, yet Fiorentina\xe2\x80\x99s subtle shift in approach turned things around. It promises to be another intriguing tussle between Montella and Pochettino on Thursday, two coaches whose seasons are finely poised.</p>'
