b'Winston Bogarde backs Louis van Gaal to emulate Sir Alex Ferguson'


b'<p>Winston Bogarde believes Louis van Gaal and Sir Alex Ferguson share similar managerial qualities, with the former defender clear the Dutchman will guide Manchester United to success if given time.</p> <p>Bogarde played for Van Gaal at Ajax and Barcelona in the 1990s, winning the Champions League and Dutch and Spanish titles under him.</p> <p>Asked if Van Gaal is similar to Ferguson, Bogarde said: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, he can be quite forceful. He\xe2\x80\x99s the right person for that club. He has the same authority Ferguson had but we have to give him time because Ferguson has been there for many years and he has been successful a lot. And I think Louis van Gaal will be also successful.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The 44-year-old, who wants a return to football as a manager after his career ended on a sour note following 12 appearances for Chelsea between 2000 and 2004, believes once Van Gaal has assembled the squad he wants, he can oversee the type of football Bogarde once enjoyed. \xe2\x80\x9cAs I look at the United players, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the players to play that soccer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bogarde. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wants that but it\xe2\x80\x99s his first season.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to take him some time, to adjust to the English way of thinking, English way of soccer, and at the end I think he will be very successful also. Where he\xe2\x80\x99s been in Spain and Holland he\xe2\x80\x99s been successful, also in Germany [at Bayern Munich] \xe2\x80\x93 the biggest clubs in the world. So he will be successful there too.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Describing the 1995 Ajax side which won the Champions League, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was attacking, dominant pressing forward soccer. It was something new. The system that we played, we played with three defenders in the back, with a lot of space \xe2\x80\x93 that was new, also for us. It was his vision and he did a fantastic job to find the right players to put also in the right positions. I learned a lot.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
