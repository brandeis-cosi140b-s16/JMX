b'Steven Gerrard pays high price for starting his farewell tour so early'


b'<p>A list of Steven Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s red cards reveals a player whose rare flashes of indiscipline almost always come in the most heated circumstances. Seven times he has been sent off while representing Liverpool: twice in the Merseyside derby, twice against Manchester United, and once in the final minute of a crucial season-ending match against Chelsea in 2003 with Champions League qualification at stake and slipping from his side\xe2\x80\x99s grasp. On all but one of those seven occasions, his side was already losing when he departed.</p> <p>It is difficult to argue that a player whose career highlights include a stunning, stoppage-time FA Cup final equaliser in 2006 and a man-of-the-match performance as Liverpool came from 3-0 down to win the 2005 Champions League reacts badly to adversity. Occasionally, Sunday being the most recent example,, however, we witness the villainous yin to the heroic yang.</p>  <p> Related: Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Martin Skrtel charged over stamp on David de Gea </p>   <p>But when in January Gerrard announced his decision to join LA Galaxy once the season ends, sparking a long and public countdown to his departure, he placed himself under an additional burden. A man who has made 704 appearances for Liverpool had, before Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s game against United, at most 11 to come. Now, with a suspension to serve, there can be no more than seven. Players leave clubs all the time, of course, but few tell their fans about it several months in advance \xe2\x80\x93 and when they do, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always help.</p> <p>Liverpool have experienced both sweet and sour farewells. Kevin Keegan had won three league titles, two Uefa Cups, an FA Cup and a European Cup during six stellar years at Anfield before moving to Hamburg in 1977. Like Gerrard his decision had become public with much of his final season still to play and it provoked resentment among many fans \xe2\x80\x93 even though Liverpool came a defeat in the FA Cup final away from a then-unprecedented treble that year.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere were mixed feelings about Kevin not putting the club first \xe2\x80\x93 the fans didn\xe2\x80\x99t like that,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote the former Liverpool midfielder Jimmy Case in his recent autobiography, Hard Case. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can never argue with a player wanting to move on and better himself but the fans don\xe2\x80\x99t always see it that way, and they weren\xe2\x80\x99t too happy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The bitterness surrounding his departure still affects Keegan\xe2\x80\x99s reputation at Anfield: in 2013 fans were surveyed to rank the greatest players in the club\xe2\x80\x99s history and, despite his achievements, Keegan found himself down at No19, just behind Dirk Kuyt.</p> <p>Supporters were considerably more forgiving when, in 1986, Ian Rush agreed a move to Juventus that would not be completed until the following summer. On that occasion supporters volunteered to pay a 25p-a-head levy on ticket prices \xe2\x80\x93 raising around \xc2\xa3200,000 a season \xe2\x80\x93 in an unsuccessful bid to convince their prolific striker that he did not need the higher salary on offer in Serie A.</p> <p>It probably helped that Rush\xe2\x80\x99s performances continued to live up to his astonishingly prolific standards. After Rush\xe2\x80\x99s final home game, a 1-0 victory over Watford in which the winner was his 40th and final goal of the season, fans in the Kop raised a giant rubber hand to help them wave goodbye more efficiently. \xe2\x80\x9cFarewell and good luck,\xe2\x80\x9d read one banner. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter the Italian job come back here,\xe2\x80\x9d sniffed another. He returned after one season.</p> <p>On both occasions the player\xe2\x80\x99s declaration of his intentions gave the club ample time to recruit a successor. Kenny Dalglish replaced Keegan in the side in 1977 and the Scot, by then the player-manager, signed John Aldridge halfway through Rush\xe2\x80\x99s final campaign. Though he did not immediately impress and Dalglish was still promising to \xe2\x80\x9cdo our very best to find someone or something to replace Ian Rush\xe2\x80\x9d as the striker packed his bags, Aldridge was the country\xe2\x80\x99s leading marksman the following season.</p> <p>Similarly, Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s early announcement has allowed Jordan Henderson to give a passable audition for the role of Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s captain and midfield heartbeat.</p>  <p> Related: Why Juan Mata is a matchwinner and not a dangerous adornment | Barney Ronay </p>   <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s right to announce it well in advance,\xe2\x80\x9d says Liam Brady, who made public his decision to leave Arsenal nine months before completing his move to Juventus in the summer of 1980. \xe2\x80\x9cSome players hang on to try to kid everybody, kid the press and kid the fans. I wanted to be fair to the Arsenal supporters and the directors by saying, \xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t be here after this season\xe2\x80\x99. Kevin Keegan had gone abroad a couple of years earlier and he\xe2\x80\x99d opened the doors.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut with Steven it\xe2\x80\x99s a bit different. I was leaving when I was 24 because Italy was the up-and-coming league and there was an opportunity there for me to play for one of the big clubs. Steven\xe2\x80\x99s coming to the end of his career and it\xe2\x80\x99s a chance for him to play in a different place, a pretty easy league from what I can see. But like him I\xe2\x80\x99d grown up at the club. I was there from when I was 13. I was very sad to be leaving but, you know, you just have to back your own judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Brady\xe2\x80\x99s final season in London ended, as Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s still might, with his club narrowly failing to qualify for Europe through the league and losing the FA Cup final.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think knowing you\xe2\x80\x99re going to leave does change the way you play,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re desperate to leave in the best way possible. Unfortunately for me it didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen like that; but there\xe2\x80\x99s every chance that Steven\xe2\x80\x99s final game will be the FA Cup final and if he wins that it would be a very nice way to go out. But having said that, if Arsenal are playing against him I hope he loses.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
