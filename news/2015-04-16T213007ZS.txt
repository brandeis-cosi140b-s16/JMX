b'Szczesny given FA Cup start but Wenger may still Cech him out of Arsenal'


b'<p>Wojciech Szczesny will start in Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup semi-final against Reading at Wembley on Saturday but Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger has admitted the Poland goalkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s future at the club beyond the summer is uncertain.</p> <p>Szczesny has lost his status as Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s No1 to David Ospina, who has started in every Premier League game since 1 January, and Wenger has also looked into signing another goalkeeper in the next transfer window.</p> <p>Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Petr Cech has emerged as a target and there is the belief at the highest level at the Emirates Stadium that a deal could be struck for him. Cech, 32, has been displaced by Thibaut Courtois at Stamford Bridge and he has said that he cannot contemplate another in-and-out season like the one he has had.</p> <p>After 11 years of outstanding service for Chelsea \xe2\x80\x93 and because of the respect for him from the club\xe2\x80\x99s owner, Roman Abramovich, and Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho \xe2\x80\x93 he will be allowed to choose his next club, even if it remains difficult to imagine the Portuguese manager allowing that club to be Arsenal. Cech has one year to run on his contract but he would cost \xc2\xa310m.</p> <p>The spectre of the Czech has ratcheted up the pressure on Ospina and Szczesny, with the former determined to continue his solid form and convince Wenger that he ought to persist with him as the No1 next season. Since Ospina displaced Szczesny in the league team, he has conceded 10 goals in 15 matches.</p> <p>Szczesny has not lost faith in his ability though and is realistic about his absence from Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s best XI, which began after his horror show in the 2-0 loss at Southampton on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day. The team have done well since and he accepts that Ospina deserves his place.</p> <p>Szczesny believes he will regain the position from Ospina and that he will remain at Arsenal, although Wenger was unusually ambivalent when asked whether the 24-year-old had a long-term future at the club.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat is at the moment \xe2\x80\x93 I hope, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d Wenger said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut at the moment it is very difficult to answer that question, you know. What is important is Saturday.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Wenger was not particularly effusive about Ospina, either, which also seemed a little strange given the Colombian\xe2\x80\x99s general reliability. Ospina has not been overworked during his time in the team but his calm and unfussy style has been a part of Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s excellent recent run.</p> <p>Wenger was asked whether he agreed that a lot of what had gone well for the team since January had been down to Ospina.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with you about that,\xe2\x80\x9d Wenger replied. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had many players back who were out in the first part of the championship \xe2\x80\x93 Koscielny, \xc3\x96zil, Giroud. They all came back and they came back into form as well in January. It\xe2\x80\x99s a mixture of many things and, as well, Coquelin coming into the team and doing well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Wenger is sticking rigidly to his policy of picking the back-up goalkeeper in the FA Cup, as he did throughout the successful run to the trophy last season, when he preferred Lukasz Fabianski to Szczesny, who was then the No1. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a line of conduct that I respect,\xe2\x80\x9d Wenger said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe goalkeepers know the rules. They are set at the start of the season. I replaced Wojciech because he had a bad game [at Southampton]. I still think he is a great goalkeeper and I want him as well to have the opportunity to show that.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI watched PSG against Barcelona on Wednesday night and Barcelona played their No2 goalkeeper [Marc-Andr\xc3\xa9 ter Stegen] in the Champions League [quarter-final]. Why? Because you need to give them competition as well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Wenger said it was not incongruous that Ospina, who has established himself as the No1 on merit, should lose his place for a Wembley cup tie because of in-house rules rather than any poor performances.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is based on merit,\xe2\x80\x9d Wenger said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have a disastrous game, you don\xe2\x80\x99t play in the next one. But once you have the rule, based on the fact that Wojciech had a good game against Manchester United [in the previous round of the cup], there is no special reason to drop him for Saturday.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe situation can change again on the performances of Ospina and the performances of Wojciech. We are in a competitive world and you have to accept that nothing is definite.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Wenger revealed that the captain, Mikel Arteta, had suffered a setback in his recovery from ankle damage after his appearance for the club\xe2\x80\x99s under-21 team on the Tuesday of last week, and he is concerned that Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain might not play again this season. The winger is still to shake off the inflammation in a groin.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s in the balance,\xe2\x80\x9d Wenger said of Oxlade-Chamberlain\xe2\x80\x99s prospects of returning before the end of the season. \xe2\x80\x9cArteta should be back in full training next week.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
