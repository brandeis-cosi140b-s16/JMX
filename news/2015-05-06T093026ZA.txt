b'<p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe pitch invasion at Blackpool at the weekend featured one fan on a mobility scooter,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Will Hollick. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this the only example of a motorised incursion on to the field of play outside the game\xe2\x80\x99s laws \xe2\x80\x93 and if not, where else can we find a transgression by man and machine?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>For those who haven\xe2\x80\x99t watched the footage of the scenes at Bloomfield Road, a few hundred supporters gathered in the centre circle at the start of the second half to protest against Karl Oyston\xe2\x80\x99s ownership of the club. They were followed by 60-year-old Bobby Mack, who drove his mobility scooter on to the pitch to join in the protests. \xe2\x80\x9cI was doing it to get back at Mr Oyston, my legs might not work but my brain certainly does,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the Blackpool Gazette. \xe2\x80\x9cThe facilities at Bloomfield Road are diabolical for us disabled fans. It\xe2\x80\x99s not good enough and his comments [Oyston texted a supporter calling him a \xe2\x80\x98retard\xe2\x80\x99 and telling him to enjoy his \xe2\x80\x98special needs day out\xe2\x80\x99] were very offensive to disabled people.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mack is not the first fan with mobility issues to turn pitch invader. Liam Davis\xe2\x80\x99s injury-time equaliser for relegation-threatened Northampton Town against Rotherham in 2010-11 led to a perhaps 100 happy Cobblers dancing on to the playing surface. They were quickly ushered off but the restart was delayed by 18-year-old Derry Felton in his motorised wheelchair. \xe2\x80\x9cI said to my mate: \xe2\x80\x9cIf they score I will go on the pitch\xe2\x80\x9d,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the Daily Mail. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe that they would. Then they did and it was a bit of a blur really. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what was happening and then I was in the middle of the pitch and I just thought how did I get here?\xe2\x80\x9d</p>            <p>While Felton\xe2\x80\x99s charge on to the pitch and the Blackpool sit-in were both peaceful, incidents of a dangerous nature are not unheard of. There was one such incident in Swansea three-and-a-half years ago, when a match between Mumbles Rangers and Kingsbridge Colts was disrupted by a Mitsubishi performing \xe2\x80\x98donuts\xe2\x80\x99 in the centre circle. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he was mad or drunk but somebody could have been seriously injured or killed,\xe2\x80\x9d the Mumbles Rangers chairman, Chris Parkin, told the BBC. \xe2\x80\x9cThe players and supporters were astounded. They stopped what they were doing and just looked at what was happening.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>And, back in 2010, a red card led to red mist in the eyes of an amateur footballer in Southport, Joseph Rimmer, who got straight into his vehicle upon his sending-off and attempted to mow down the referee who had expelled him. Rimmer was later jailed for six months over the incident.</p> <p>Although it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in-game, the Leicester City owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha caused a surreal disruption after his side\xe2\x80\x99s 3-1 defeat to Chelsea last Wednesday. Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s unused substitutes were warming down after the game when the Tannoy blared out the urgent message that they needed to leave the field straight away \xe2\x80\x93 to allow Srivaddhanaprabha\xe2\x80\x99s helicopter to land and whisk him up and off.</p> <p>No humans involved \xe2\x80\x93 not visibly anyway \xe2\x80\x93 in this one, but that infamous night in Belgrade last October also deserves a mention here if we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about motorised visitors from the sky. It\xe2\x80\x99s not every day that a drone trailing a deeply incendiary flag causes all hell to break loose on a football pitch, after all. And for a perfectly legal motorised visit that ended up going slightly awry, look no further than Gabriel Zakuani\xe2\x80\x99s exacerbated injury at this year\xe2\x80\x99s Africa Cup of Nations. Even better, look at the look he gives the buggy driver.</p>            THIS IS THE KIT <p>\xe2\x80\x9cReading the news that Arsenal will wear their yellow and blue away kit in the FA Cup final (because Villa won the toss to wear their usual kit) reminded me of the finals in 1978 (v Ipswich) and 1980 (v West Ham),\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Mark Goodge this time last week, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere Arsenal wore yellow and blue on both occasions, and lost both times \xe2\x80\x93 the latter to a headed goal by Trevor Brooking, which apparently he never scored very many of. But I digress. My real question is this: is there a statistical disadvantage \xe2\x80\x93 or even an advantage \xe2\x80\x93 to wearing your away kit at a cup final? Obviously, teams will both win and lose more often in total wearing their home kit, as in many cases there won\xe2\x80\x99t be a clash so neither side has to change. But do teams do significantly worse or better when wearing a change strip?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The history of Cup final change kits gets off to a pleasingly antsy start. Let us take you back to 1882 when Old Etonians, who had been resplendent in light green shirts in each of their four previous appearances, modelled a new green and white chequered outfit for that season\xe2\x80\x99s showpiece against Blackburn Rovers. That did not sit well with the Lancashire club\xe2\x80\x99s blue and white halves \xe2\x80\x93 a fact that appeared to escape them until they arrived in London, when they hurriedly purchased themselves a thinly-hooped set of black and white tops.</p> <p>The result? A 1-0 win for Old Etonians at Kennington Oval \xe2\x80\x93 with Blackburn apparently claiming that the last-minute change of colours had contributed to the reverse. They would not be able to suggest the same eight years later when, incredibly, they had to play in a set of tailored white dress shirts to avoid a clash with The Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s colours and won 6-1.</p> <p>The tone having been set, here come the stats. Particularly in the tournament\xe2\x80\x99s earlier years, there were times when both teams changed colours \xe2\x80\x93 so these apply only to times on which one side took the hit, and to occasions when the colours themselves were changed rather than simply the design (for example the vogue for Cup final pinstripes that briefly reared its head in the 1950s). By our count, since the FA Cup\xe2\x80\x99s inception the team in its change strip has won eight times \xe2\x80\x93 and lost on 15 occasions. Damningly conclusive in favour of colour-based familiarity, no? No, says David Filip, who is back for more after featuring in last week\xe2\x80\x99s column and has done some similar research using a slightly different sample and significantly more brainpower. Take it away, David:</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\x9cExamining data from the last 50 League Cup and FA Cup finals, 25 of those finals were played with one team in their home kit and the other in their away kit, not counting three instances in which teams switched kits for the replay. Only eight of those 25 finals were won by the team in the away kit \xe2\x80\x93 a paltry 32%. But is it statistically significant?\xe2\x80\x9cTo test for the statistical significance of the figure, I used the binomial exact test, which is used when the outcomes of trials (cup finals in this case) are assumed to be independent (the outcome in one cup final with teams wearing opposite kits does not affect the outcome of the next, which is a pretty safe assumption here) and have the same probability of success (we are not assuming home/away kits inherently affect the likelihood of winning). As an analogy, the same test would be used if you flipped a coin 25 times, it turned up heads eight times, and you wanted to know if it was an unfair coin. I set my a-level at the standard 0.05, meaning that the test would have to return a p-value below that in order for teams wearing opposite kits to be considered statistically significant. The p-value returned was 0.1078. So, based on these data, I cannot claim that teams do significantly worse or better in cup finals when wearing their away kit against teams wearing their home kit.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p>And we thought we\xe2\x80\x99d been pretty thorough there.</p> DON\xe2\x80\x99T STOP MOVING <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhile watching the FA Cup semi-final between Reading and Arsenal, I was impressed with one of their defenders, Michael Hector,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Ankur Jain last week. \xe2\x80\x9cNot being a big Championship fan and having never heard of this player before, a quick check showed in his first five seasons as a professional (2009-10 to 2013-14), he has played for a whopping 12 different clubs. During this period, by my calculations, he has also played in the second, third, fourth, sixth, seventh and eighth tiers of English football. If that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough, he has also played in the Irish and Scottish top flights. Has a player ever had a more nomadic start to his career than young Michael? Indeed, is there a player who has appeared in the top eight tiers of English football during his career?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>They would be hard pushed, on the latter at least. And a current club-mate of Hector\xe2\x80\x99s is as realistic a contender as anyone else. The Crystal Palace striker Kwesi Appiah \xe2\x80\x93 on loan with the Royals \xe2\x80\x93 has played in the seventh tier with King\xe2\x80\x99s Lynn, Thurrock, Brackley Town and Margate; the Conference with the likes of Ebbsfleet, Weymouth and Kettering; League Two with Cambridge United, AFC Wimbledon and Aldershot; League One with Yeovil and Notts County; the Championship with Crystal Palace and Reading \xe2\x80\xa6 and has played in the final of the Africa Cup of Nations with Ghana. What price a few minutes in the Premier League next season for the club at which he signed a new contract in the spring? Regardless, the yet more impressive statistic is that Appiah is just 24 and has spent a remarkable 16 different spells with 15 clubs (he was at Cambridge twice).</p> <p>Ian Burke has the definitive \xe2\x80\x93 ish \xe2\x80\x93 answer, though:</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve found someone who has played in eight out of the top nine in Stefan Moore. As well as turning out in the Premier League for Villa, he was loaned out to Chesterfield in League One as well as Millwall and Leicester in the Championship. After his release from Villa in 2005, he spent his time between the Championship and League One with QPR, Walsall and Port Vale, before moving down to the Conference with Kidderminster in 2008. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter that, he turned up at tier seven Halesowen Town, then to tier nine St Neots Town, where he helped them win promotion to the Southern League Central Division (tier eight). He stuck around a few more months until a short spell at Leamington begat a move to Conference North side Brackley (tier six) on a dual-registration deal.\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s currently in the Conference North with Solihull Moors, which means that League Two is the only level where Stefan Moore hasn\xe2\x80\x99t played. He\xe2\x80\x99s still only 31, so if any kindly gaffers fancy giving him a game to complete the set \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p>Start the bidding, fourth-tier bosses \xe2\x80\x93 for Moore has actually just become a free agent.</p> KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE <p>\xe2\x80\x9cCan someone please tell me why the Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid club crest contains what looks like a bear trying to get jiggy with a cherry tree?\xe2\x80\x9d wondered Steve Guy back in 2007.</p>     Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s club crest. Photograph: Public domain    <p>Well Steve, you have obviously never been to Puerta Del Sol square in Madrid, because you would have seen the 20-tonne statue known as El Oso y el Madro\xc3\xb1o, a life-size model of a bear doing nothing more than sniffing a Madro\xc3\xb1o tree.</p> <p>The story goes that the word Madro\xc3\xb1o sounds like Madrid, so the tree was adopted as a symbol of the city. Bears used to be common around Madrid, so the two items were thrown together and they now appear on the city\xe2\x80\x99s taxis, buildings and man-hole covers. Atl\xc3\xa9tico added the bear and tree to their badge at some point between 1903 and 1919, and the seven stars on the club crest represent the autonomous region of Madrid (or Big Bear constellation). If you think the Madrid bear is looking lustful, have a look at the similar-looking Warwickshire coat of arms. Warwickshire County Cricket Club, meanwhile, have chosen a more-restrained version.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive.</p> CAN YOU HELP? <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPhilips announced last week that they would stop being PSV\xe2\x80\x99s shirt sponsor after next season, after having spent 34 years on the front of the PSV jersey, ever since shirt sponsors were introduced in the Netherlands,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Kees Haasnoot. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this the longest run of shirt sponsoring in the world? Are there any other clubs left that have only had one name on their jersey?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe Commonwealth of Independent States competed at the European Championships in 1992,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Philip Farrell. \xe2\x80\x9cApart from the four constituent parts of the United Kingdom; is this the only example of a non-nation state participating at a major tournament?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBelfast Celtic (1891-1949) won 14 Irish League titles and 8 Irish Cups,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Philip Farrell. \xe2\x80\x9cAre they the most successful extinct European club?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve just looked at the bottom of the Scottish Championship table (yes I am that bored, sadly), and noticed the astounding goal difference difference between 10th placed Cowdenbeath and ninth-placed Alloa,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Leo Addor. \xe2\x80\x9cAlloa have a goal difference of -22, Cowdenbeath a goal difference of -55 \xe2\x80\x93a goal difference difference of 33 for two teams placed adjacent to each other in the league table. My question is: is this the greatest goal difference difference ever among teams sitting right next to each other on a major professional league table at the end of the season?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cGlenn Murray is likely going to be top league goalscorer for both Reading and Crystal Palace this year,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Paul Rumble. \xe2\x80\x9cHas this happened before and what are the highest totals recorded?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs an exiled Swindon fan (currently in China) not quite keeping up to date with all the squad news, I was initially confused when following our game earlier today to see our sent off goalie Belford replaced between the sticks by Belford,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Jack. \xe2\x80\x9cTurns out they are brothers \xe2\x80\x93 Tyrell and Cameron \xe2\x80\x93 and not one and the same. Is this the first time one brother has replaced another in goal?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com.</p>'
