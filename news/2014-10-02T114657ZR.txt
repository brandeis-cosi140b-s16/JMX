b'    Roy Hodgson says Daniel Sturridge is out of England squad \xe2\x80\x93 video    <p>Roy Hodgson has bowed to the demands of the Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers by leaving his striker Daniel Sturridge out of the England squad.</p> <p>Sturridge is in contention to play for Liverpool against West Bromwich Albion on Saturday after a month-long thigh injury lay-off, but he has been left out of Hodgson\xe2\x80\x99s 21-strong party for England\xe2\x80\x99s forthcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia.</p> <p>The Liverpool manager insisted on Wednesday that the 25-year-old has still not fully recovered from the injury, which he sustained on international duty last month, and his name was absent from the squad list released by the Football Association at Wembley on Thursday afternoon.</p> <p>Hodgson told a press conference how disappointed he was that Sturridge was not in a position to join up with the squad, but he insisted there have been no problems between club and country over his potential inclusion.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a great blow for us and it\xe2\x80\x99s been a big blow for Liverpool, of course, and it will continue to be,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s also a blow for the player because he was very anxious to be a part of these two games, but unfortunately injuries happen and we all accept it so there are no problems or conflict there at all.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>When asked if it would have been at all possible for Sturridge to train with the squad and feature against Estonia on 12 October, Hodgson said it was best for the player to focus on improving his overall fitness.</p> <p>He said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, he\xe2\x80\x99s not played for Liverpool at all since picking up the injury with us. If he was to get fitter during the week which starts on Monday, then he\xe2\x80\x99s still got a lot of work to do to bring himself up to speed to be able to play for Liverpool in their games.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Daniel Sturridge suffered a thigh injury with England last month and has missed Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s last six matches. Photograph: Nick Potts/PA    <p>The England manager also denied suggestions that the Liverpool forward\xe2\x80\x99s injury shows there are problems with the national side\xe2\x80\x99s training regime, although he said it is something they will consider.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re very disappointed about it but it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously something we will consider going forward,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut the other thing people do need to consider is that we have such a shortage of time and on this particular occasion we had two days to try and hone a very different way of playing.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cStrangely enough, Danny was a very important part of that because we wanted him and Wayne Rooney to play as split strikers and he had a lot of experience of playing that from his Liverpool time, so it was very unfortunate.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut if I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be put under pressure in future to give every player two days off every time we play, then we won\xe2\x80\x99t train at all quite frankly, because we don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough time pre-match and post-match.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>There were surprise call-ups for the Swansea midfielder Jonjo Shelvey and the Southampton defender Nathaniel Clyne.</p> <p>Clyne has been in good form for Southampton this year, scoring two goals in eight appearances.</p> <p>The former Crystal Palace defender has eight England Under-21 caps, but he has not played for the senior side before.</p> <p>Shelvey\xe2\x80\x99s only cap for England came two years ago against San Marino, who come to Wembley on 9 October \xe2\x80\x93 three days before the Three Lions continue their qualification campaign in Estonia.</p>    <p>The Welbeck news doesn&#39;t seem to have reached the FA . . pic.twitter.com/WZqipbvYaF</p>&mdash; Daniel Taylor (@DTguardian) October 2, 2014    <p>Luke Shaw and Calum Chambers have been dropped to the Under-21s, while the Manchester United defender Phil Jones has been left out through injury.</p> <p>Everton\xe2\x80\x99s 20-year-old defender John Stones has retained his place \xe2\x80\x93 as has Fabian Delph, who impressed on his full debut against Switzerland last month.
