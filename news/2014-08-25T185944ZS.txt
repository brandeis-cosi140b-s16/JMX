b'<p>Everton are close to signing the veteran striker Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o as Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez seeks to increase his forward options before the transfer deadline.</p> <p>The 33-year-old is a free agent following his release by Chelsea at the end of last season and had been Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s fall-back option in the event of Brendan Rodgers deciding against a move for Mario Balotelli. However, with Balotelli sealing his \xc2\xa316m transfer from Milan to Anfield on Monday, Eto\xe2\x80\x99o is poised to move to the other side of Stanley Park and there are suggestions he could be given a two-year contract.</p> <p>Eto\xe2\x80\x99o, once the highest paid player in the world at Anzhi Makhachkala, was looking for a six-figure weekly wage from Liverpool but would not earn that sum at Everton, although he is likely to bank a sizeable signing on fee as a free agent. The former Real Madrid, Barcelona and Internazionale striker has also held talks with Ajax this summer and has options across Europe but is keen to remain in the Premier League.</p> <p>Mart\xc3\xadnez is anxious to land another forward before next Monday\xe2\x80\x99s deadline as Everton have little back-up for \xc2\xa328m record signing Romelu Lukaku with Arouna Kon\xc3\xa9 out injured still recovering from a knee problem.</p>'
