b'Born winner Ronald Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s mindset can guide Southampton into top four  | David Hytner'


b'<p>Ronald Koeman was affronted, and everyone who knows the Southampton manager knows how that tends to end up. It was the beginning of the 1993-94 season and Johan Cruyff had decided to shake things up at Barcelona by signing the Brazil striker Rom\xc3\xa1rio.</p> <p>It was the days of the three-foreigner rule and Cruyff already had Koeman, Hristo Stoichkov and Michael Laudrup. Four into three would not go and there was much discussion about the manager\xe2\x80\x99s lineup for the opening game of the season against Real Sociedad at the Camp Nou.</p> <p>Koeman had scored the winning goal in the European Cup final against Sampdoria at Wembley in May of the previous year and he felt untouchable. The ball-playing, goalscoring central defender had built an excellent relationship with the midfield pivot, Pep Guardiola. But Cruyff left out Koeman, leading to a memorable exchange between the pair.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBoss,\xe2\x80\x9d Koeman said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the first time but also the last time.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Tonny Bruins Slot chuckles at the memory. The 67-year-old was Cruyff\xe2\x80\x99s long-time assistant, at Ajax for three years previously and at Barcelona for what would be eight. Barcelona beat Sociedad 3-0, with Rom\xc3\xa1rio scoring all three. \xe2\x80\x9cSo it was a good decision from the technical staff, ja?\xe2\x80\x9d Bruins Slot says.</p> <p>Koeman, though, was right. It was the last time. He regained his place in what was known as Cruyff\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cDream Team\xe2\x80\x9d and, in the end, it was the supremely gifted Laudrup who was the odd man out. The Dane joined Real Madrid at the end of the season in what was considered to be his revenge on Cruyff. Barcelona won their fourth successive league title.</p> <p>Koeman has never tolerated obstacles in his path. Since the days when he was a headstrong youth prospect, he has always given the impression that they are mere inconveniences. Those who know him the best, such as Bruins Slot, the assistant manager to him at Ajax, Benfica, PSV Eindhoven, Valencia and AZ Alkmaar over eight years, talk of his insane will to win.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEven in the training sessions, he likes to win the short games,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruins Slot says. \xe2\x80\x9cOK, he likes to relax and take a beer when the job is done but when he is for the job, he is fanatical, very intense, decisive. We say in Holland that he is the winner. He was born into a football family so, as a baby, he was eating football.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s challenge at Southampton is up there with his biggest. The most exclusive club in English football is the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s top four and there have been only 13 members.</p> <p>Since the league\xe2\x80\x99s inception in 1992, it has been dominated by Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Liverpool. Newcastle United boast five top-four finishes, Manchester City four and, beyond that, the pickings are slim. Leeds United, Blackburn Rovers, Tottenham Hotspur, Aston Villa, Everton, Nottingham Forest and Norwich City make up the numbers. The final three teams have made it just once.</p> <p>Koeman has taken Southampton into roped-off territory. They sit fourth in the table, two points clear of Tottenham in fifth and they will step out against United at Old Trafford on Sunday in confident mood. Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s head-to-head with his old Dutch rival Louis van Gaal feels like a footnote. Southampton are seeking a statement result. Victory would lift them above United into third place and further fire the dreams of their supporters.</p> <p>Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s application to the VIP area would have been mocked at the end of June. At the time, their ability to survive in the Premier League was being questioned. Koeman was newly arrived from Feyenoord to succeed Mauricio Pochettino, who had moved to Tottenham, and a clutch of star players were also gone.</p> <p>Koeman did not panic. He knew the reinforcements would arrive, and they did \xe2\x80\x93 Dusan Tadic and Graziano Pell\xc3\xa8 have been the pick of an eye-catching crop \xe2\x80\x93 but, more importantly, Koeman knew that his style would work in England.</p> <p>The belief was stoked, in part, by the Premier League scalps that he had taken. At Benfica in 2005-06 he knocked Manchester United out of the Champions League group phase with a 2-1 home win in the final tie and then beat Liverpool at home and away in the last 16.</p> <p>At Ajax in 2002-03 he had drawn at home and away with Arsenal en route to qualifying from the second group stage \xe2\x80\x93 Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s team were squeezed out \xe2\x80\x93 while, at PSV in 2006-07, he beat Arsenal in the last 16, before losing to Liverpool in the quarter-final. There was also the 0-0 group phase draw with Valencia at Chelsea in 2007-08. Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s Arsenal did beat Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s AZ Alkmaar 4-1 at the group stage in 2009-10 at Emirates Stadium, after a 1-1 draw in Holland.</p> <p>Bruins Slot was a scout at Ajax when Koeman moved there as a young player in 1983 and his subsequent role on Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s various managerial staffs involved tactical preparation and being the head of scouting. He is back at Ajax, where he compiles dossiers on the opposition for the manager, Frank de Boer. His knowledge of world football is encyclopaedic.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe style of thinking of myself and Ronald will get good results against the style of top English teams,\xe2\x80\x9d Bruins Slot says. \xe2\x80\x9cMy opinion is that it\xe2\x80\x99s easier to play against a top English club because they like to play football and they play open.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey give a lot of space between the lines and when you use the total field, also the wings \xe2\x80\xa6 when you make the pitch big, then you have a lot of space to touch and to play. We play very good against my friend, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger. He plays wonderful football, very elegant and not directly physical, and we have demonstrated that we can always have a good result against Arsenal.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Ronald\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy and he was also a player in that same philosophy. He had a very good view of the game, tactically, at Barcelona and he was playing together with our midfield player, Guardiola. They are now top European coaches. They have taken the DNA of Cruyff, his idea of playing and training. Cruyff was a very big influence on Koeman and Guardiola.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Bruins Slot talks in detail about how Koeman likes to add the extra man in buildup play; to stretch the game and work in between the lines, not only with the forwards but with the midfielders going \xe2\x80\x9cfive steps in behind to make one line more\xe2\x80\x9d. He notes the importance of playing \xe2\x80\x9cin the three angles\xe2\x80\x9d, of options for the man in possession, of sound technique and, above all, of making the ball do the work \xe2\x80\x93 the basic tenet of the Cruyff method.</p> <p>It has worked at Southampton, particularly at home, where the team have often been excellent to watch. A highlight came on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, when they took Arsenal apart to win 2-0. They also won at Arsenal in the Capital One Cup and they lost in the last minute at the Emirates in the league.</p> <p>Realism tempers the excitement, not least from Koeman. His squad lacks experience in depth, although they have not been drained by the demands of European football. Most of Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s rivals remain in either the Champions League or Europa League.</p> <p>Premier League history is dotted with less fancied teams who have occupied top four places on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, only to fall away. There was Bolton Wanderers in 2007, Charlton Athletic in 2004 and Sunderland in 2000 and 2001. Koeman, as ever, is primed for the fight.</p>'
