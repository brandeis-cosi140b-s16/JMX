b'Everton prepare to face Wolfsburg and embrace the maligned Europa League'


b'<p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot stand still,\xe2\x80\x9d said Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez on Everton\xe2\x80\x99s desire to build a stadium in Walton Hall Park, less than a mile from the club\xe2\x80\x99s historic home at Goodison Park. The sentiment also applies to the team who last season recorded Everton\xe2\x80\x99s highest points tally of the Premier League era. For that development, their manager has designs on Warsaw.</p> <p>The Polish capital will host this season\xe2\x80\x99s Europa League final, now offering the significant bonus of a Champions League place for the winner, and though it is not in Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s nature to get ahead of himself, there has been no disguising the importance he has placed on a frequently maligned competition. He began talking European squad numbers late last season, selected pre-season friendlies with continental challenges in mind and views the Europa League as essential to Everton\xe2\x80\x99s progress. \xe2\x80\x9cWe really want to go all the way in the Europa League,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>There have been no grumblings about the Europa workload allowed at Goodison. Even a demanding group containing Wolfsburg, Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s opening opponents, Lille and Krasnodar, the Russian conquerors of Real Sociedad in the play-offs, is merely an incentive to Mart\xc3\xadnez on his European debut as a manager.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe are very excited, as you can imagine, and we have been working hard for over 12 months to achieve this opportunity,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of Everton\xe2\x80\x99s first European tie in five seasons. Their last was a 4-2 aggregate defeat to Sporting Lisbon in the last 32 of the Europa League in February 2010.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe Europa League is a great competition and is where we need to be testing ourselves. The only way to fulfil our potential is to be playing games like the one we are going to face on Thursday. The draw has been kind in that it will bring two phenomenal football teams with the quality of Lille and Wolfsburg to Goodison, and then a really surprising package of Krasnodar. In terms of the group stage, it\xe2\x80\x99s a phenomenal challenge for us. But that\xe2\x80\x99s what we want at Everton. We embrace playing in Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Many Premier League squads have been strained by the Thursday-Sunday routine, Everton among them during David Moyes\xe2\x80\x99 time as manager, but Mart\xc3\xadnez said his squad are equipped for the demands. Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o and Sylvain Distin, who missed Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s first Premier League win of the season, at West Bromwich Albion, through injury, are available for Wolfsburg\xe2\x80\x99s visit.</p> <p>Mart\xc3\xadnez said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not a team who wants to moan about the number of games or talk about the Europa League in a disrespectful manner. I do feel that playing against German teams, French teams, and Russian teams will bring a completely different tactical approach and we will benefit from that. As a player, you want to play games. If it means playing Thursday and Sunday, then that\xe2\x80\x99s what you want. If you have a whole week to prepare for one game, you need two really hard training sessions. As a player I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you really look forward to coming into training and putting a lot of effort into that. Football is contact sport and if you can avoid injuries, you welcome games.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Wolfsburg, fifth in the Bundesliga last season, have lost one and drawn two of their three league fixtures but carry a clear threat in the Croatia veteran Ivica Olic, once of Bayern Munich, Maximilian Arnold and Aaron Hunt. The former Chelsea player Kevin De Bruyne and Nicklas Bendtner, previously of Arsenal, are also in their ranks.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey are a well-structured team and the midfielders give really good balance to the side, and experience,\xe2\x80\x9d the Everton manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have full international players who know how to play these occasions.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As for the long-term at Everton, Mart\xc3\xadnez has given fulsome support to the proposed stadium relocation to Walton Hall Park, an anticipated scheme that was confirmed this week but remains at an embryonic stage in terms of planning and finance.</p> <p>The Everton manager added: \xe2\x80\x9cOur fans know we cannot stand still. We always need to try to help ourselves to look for the highest competitive level we can achieve and the ground has always been an issue. This is really exciting but really early stages. We want to do things right. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to involve the community, the city, all the fans. I think everyone knows this is not just the possibility of a new stadium, this is a new scheme, a regeneration project, that would be phenomenal for the city with many new jobs. It would be securing the future of our football club.\xe2\x80\x9dEverton (possible, 4-2-3-1): Howard; Coleman, Stones, Jagielka, Baines; McCarthy, Besic; McGeady, Naismith, Mirallas; Lukaku.</p> <p>Subs from: Distin, Hibbert, Barry, Robles, Alcaraz, Gibson, Osman, Pienaar, Eto\xe2\x80\x99o, Atsu, McAleny.</p> <p>Wolfsburg (possible, 4-2-3-1): Benaglio; Jung, Naldo, Knoche, Rodr\xc3\xadguez; Gustavo, De Bruyne; Perisic, Hunt, Olic; Bendtner.</p> <p>Referee: Luca Banti (It).</p>'
