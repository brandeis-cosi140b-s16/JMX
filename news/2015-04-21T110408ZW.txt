b'Wolfsburg\xe2\x80\x99s Kevin De Bruyne still open to Manchester City move, says agent'


b'<p>Kevin De Bruyne\xe2\x80\x99s agent has insisted the Belgium midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s future remains undecided despite reports that he is set to join Bayern Munich for around \xc2\xa345m, with Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester City among the clubs still interested in signing him from Wolfsburg.</p> <p>De Bruyne, who moved to Germany from Chelsea for \xc2\xa318m in January 2014, has enjoyed a superb season, guiding Wolfsburg to second place in the Bundesliga and the quarter-finals of the Europa League. The 23-year-old has racked up 15 goals and an astonishing 22 assists so far and could be in contention to win Germany\xe2\x80\x99s player of the year award.</p>  <p> Related: Manchester United in pole position to sign Memphis Depay from PSV </p>   <p>After he masterminded the 4-1 thrashing of Pep Guardiola\xe2\x80\x99s side at the end of January, Bayern are considered favourites to sign De Bruyne in the summer. However his agent Patrick De Koster says it is too early for any decision to be made.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFor the moment, there are no formal discussions. Of course in the next few weeks I will be going around the world to talk about the situation with Kevin but this is just informal information,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI will talk to everybody but Kevin is very, very happy with Wolfsburg and the way they have treated him since he arrived from Chelsea last year. There are still five games to play and hopefully they can make sure of a place in the Champions League next season so it is a little bit too early to be making any decisions. He has a four-year contract at Wolfsburg so we will have to see what they want to do.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>After their struggle to retain their Premier League title with an aging squad this season, De Bruyne fits the profile wanted by City in their drive to lower the age of the squad. De Koster admitted that he has held discussions with Txiki Begiristain, City\xe2\x80\x99s director of football, but denied any contact with Manchester United.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI have met the people from Manchester City and we know each other,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never spoken to anyone from Manchester United but a lot of other clubs have been in touch to find out some general information.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think with the season Kevin has had if we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have these questions then there would be something wrong. I saw [Mino] Raiola\xe2\x80\x99s quotes about taking 20 phone calls a day regarding Paul Pogba and it\xe2\x80\x99s the same situation for me and probably for the agent of Memphis Depay at the moment.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Asked how much it may cost to prise De Bruyne away from Wolfsburg, De Koster added: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Wolfsburg paid \xe2\x82\xac24m to Chelsea so I can see it being a lot more than that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
