b'MOU\xe2\x80\x99S MAHOGANY ABACUS <p>If the Fiver was Premier League top suit Richard Scudamore \xe2\x80\x93 and just to clarify, reader, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x93 it would consider offering Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho a job for life, once he\xe2\x80\x99s done with the whole management thing. Because in the face of astronomical ticket prices, questionable facilities for disabled fans, a \xc2\xa35.1bn domestic TV deal that looks unlikely to do anything but swell the silk-lined pockets of its clubs (who mostly refuse to pay their employees the living wage) and persistent racism scandals, nobody is doing more to promote England\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful game to the world than Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s manager.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cTo imagine English football, The Best League in the World\xe2\x84\xa2, without one single team in the [Big Cup] quarter-finals is hard. But even if that happens we would still have The Best League in the World\xe2\x84\xa2,\xe2\x80\x9d logic-ed Mourinho, taking his time to set aside his mahogany abacus.</p> <p>But no matter whatever guff flies out of the Portuguese, with his bamboozling rhetoric and a look that perfectly straddles the line between a flirty wink and a poke in the eye, would anyone dare to resist the Continental One? Perhaps PSG, who travel to London tonight for the second-leg of their Big Cup round of 16 tie. Chelsea helpfully had the weekend off to prepare, something Jos\xc3\xa9 wasn\xe2\x80\x99t one bit pleased with.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI saw PSG\xe2\x80\x99s game on Saturday [won 4-1 against Lens] and our training session that day was harder than their match\xe2\x80\x9d, zinged Jos\xc3\xa9, conveniently forgetting that PSG had previously failed to win three of their last four league games, and currently lie in second behind Lyon, whilst Chelsea are a whole five points clear in THE BEST AND MOST COMPETITIVE LEAGUE IN THE WORLD\xe2\x84\xa2.</p> <p>You hear that Zlatan and co: your easy Ligue 1 matches are a walk in the Parc compared to playing head tennis, pretending to be a fighter jet, or whatever it is that makes training sessions for clubs in THE BE \xe2\x80\xa6 (oh you get the picture) so trying these days. Look at Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas after training on Saturday, he looks knackered!</p> <p>Poor Jos\xc3\xa9. Poor Chelsea. So horribly penned into that plush corner of England\xe2\x80\x99s capital. So terribly laden with heavy recently-won silverware. So piously bankrolled by a Russian billionaire. It\xe2\x80\x99s not fair! It might appear that Mourinho is sounding the Siege Mentality Klaxon for the 1,056th time, but he\xe2\x80\x99s not! The EPL is murder: Chelsea have to go to Hull on Saturday week! Imagine!</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSo it\xe2\x80\x99s more difficult for English clubs. I am not here to protect anybody,\xe2\x80\x9d protected Mourinho, \xe2\x80\x9cbut do you think it\xe2\x80\x99s normal where Everton is in the Premier League? It\xe2\x80\x99s not normal.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Paul Doyle from 7.45pm GMT for MBM coverage of Chelsea 2-1 PSG (aet, 3-2 agg), while Michael Butler will be in situ for Bayern Munich 3-0 Shakhtar Donetsk (3-0 agg).</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy chapter with Arsenal is not closed \xe2\x80\xa6 Things may not have gone according to plan so far at Inter but I always want to look at the positives\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Lukas Podolski\xe2\x80\x99s version of \xe2\x80\x98the positives\xe2\x80\x99 might not be exactly the same as that of Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s fans.</p> FIVER LETTERS     Socrates, yesterday. Photograph: Universalimagesgroup/Getty Images    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOutrageous of V Vikas [yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters] to compare Louis van Gaal to peerless philosopher Socrates, and claim that neither had any influence on humankind. Socrates inspired Plato, who taught Aristotle, who tutored Alexander the Great, who led an all-conquering band of warriors thrashing all opposition. It\xe2\x80\x99s that last bit that makes the comparison invalid\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Charles Antaki.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Wisdom lies in knowing how little we know.\xe2\x80\x99 Socrates 6, V Vikas 0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Mark Dawson.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI hope Neil Harris does a better job at Millwall than his last gig.
