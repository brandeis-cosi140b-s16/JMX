b'Football transfer rumours: Manchester United bid \xc2\xa361.25m for Paul Pogba?'


b'<p>Juventus central midfielder Paul Pogba is arguably the best in the world at what he does and has been the subject of a couple of contrasting rumours in the past 24 hours. Italian newspaper La Stampa suggests Manchester United have submitted a bid of \xc2\xa361.25m for the ball-winning France international who left Old Trafford on a free transfer in 2012 after failing to establish himself in the first team, while the Express says Chelsea are prepared to offer various players plus \xc2\xa320m in cold hard cash in a bid to prise him away from Turin. Ramires and Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle have been mentioned as potential makeweights.</p> <p>Manchester United are also being linked with a preposterously expensive \xc2\xa3112m deal for Paris Saint-Germain Brazilian central defender Marquinhos, who went to the French capital from Roma for over \xc2\xa330m in the summer of 2013 despite having just 32 senior appearances on his curriculum vitae. Behind Thiago Silva and David Luiz in the PSG hierarchy, the 20-year-old has previously been mentioned in conjunction with moves to Barcelona, Manchester City and Arsenal.</p>  <p> Related: Transfer news: Juan Cuadrado lined up to replace Mohamed Salah and Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle \xe2\x80\x93 live! </p>   <p>Wolfsburg playmaker and one-time Chelsea midfielder Kevin De Bruyne also features prominently on the shopping list of Louis van Gaal, although Arsenal are also sniffing around the \xc2\xa325m-rated Belgian. \xe2\x80\x9cI know some clubs are interested in him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the player\xe2\x80\x99s agent, Patrick De Koster, of his 23-year-old client. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is normal. It\xe2\x80\x99s recognition for his and our hard work.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>With James Milner\xe2\x80\x99s contract talks reported to have hit an impasse at Manchester City, Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s hopes of bringing him to Anfield remain high. Anxious for more playing time, which his current club can\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee him, the 29-year-old midfielder will be a free agent come season\xe2\x80\x99s end and is also wanted by Valencia and Inter.</p> <p>With Wilfried Bony having signed for Manchester City and Baf\xc3\xa9timbi Gomis being mooted as a possible \xc2\xa39m signing for Crystal Palace, Swansea City are in urgent need of a striker. The Welsh club\xe2\x80\x99s chairman, Huw Jenkins, likes the cut of Blackburn Rovers striker Jordan Rhodes, but may have to wait until the summer to lure the 24-year-old Oldham native to the Liberty Stadium from Ewood Park.</p> <p>Having failed to make an impact at Inter after leaving Southampton on a loan deal, Dani Osvaldo could be given the chance to resurrect his troubled career by Harry Redknapp at QPR. Having already had very public fallings-out with sometime team-mates such as Jos\xc3\xa9 Fonte, Erik Lamela and Mauro Icardi, it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to imagine what could possibly go wrong, although Juventus and Boca Juniors are also believed to be interested in securing the striker\xe2\x80\x99s services.</p> <p>Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o\xe2\x80\x99s move from Everton to Sampdoria could yet hit the skids after the Italian club\xe2\x80\x99s president, Massimo Ferrero, comically claimed \xe2\x80\x9cnobody can figure out who\xe2\x80\x99s in charge\xe2\x80\x9d at the Merseyside club. Should the deal fall through, the Cameroonian striker could join up with equally sprightly young striker Ra\xc3\xbal at New York Cosmos. Meanwhile at West Brom, Giorgios Samaras looks to be heading for the Hawthorns exit door, with Saudi side al-Hilal rumoured to be taking him on a six-month loan deal, with a view to making the move permanent if the Greek striker comes bearing gifts in the shape of lots of goals.</p> <p>And lightning fast Colombian winger Juan Cuadrado is the subject of Chelsea interest, with our own Dominic Fifield revealing that the Blues have let Fiorentina know that they want to sign the right-sided midfielder in the current window to grease the wheels of possible moves for Mohamed Salah and Sch\xc3\xbcrrle to Roma and Wolfsburg respectively. Chelsea had a bid of \xc2\xa320m for the Colombian rejected by the Serie A side on Wednesday and Fiorentina\xe2\x80\x99s coach, Vincenzo Montella, has dismissed the notion of Cuadrado leaving for Stamford Bridge before the summer.</p>'
