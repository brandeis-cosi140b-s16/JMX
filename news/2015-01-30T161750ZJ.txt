b'Juan Cuadrado set to undergo Chelsea medical ahead of \xc2\xa323.3m move'


b'<p>Chelsea hope to confirm Juan Cuadrado\xe2\x80\x99s arrival from Fiorentina, subject to the player passing a medical and gaining international clearance, for an initial fee of around \xc2\xa323.3m over the weekend after the Colombia international visited the Viola\xe2\x80\x99s training ground to bid farewell to his team-mates.</p> <p>Cuadrado will fly to London on Saturday morning to undergo medical tests after the two clubs agreed a deal that, with add-ons, could eventually satisfy the \xc2\xa326.8m release clause in the 24-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s current contract. Mohamed Salah is expected to move to the Italian club on loan, with Chelsea meeting his wages, though the bulk of the transfer fee for the Colombian will effectively be met by Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle\xe2\x80\x99s imminent departure for Wolfsburg.</p> <p>The World Cup winner, who has started only five Premier League games this season, was due in Germany to undergo his own medical after verbal agreement was reached on a \xc2\xa322.5m deal to take Schurrle back to the Bundesliga after lengthy talks this week. The player\xe2\x80\x99s agent, Ingo Haspel, confirmed that he expected the deal to go through ahead of the weekend with Sch\xc3\xbcrrle to join his former Chelsea team-mate, Kevin de Bruyne, at the club who currently sit second in their domestic league.</p> <p>Cuadrado, so impressive at last summer\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup finals, is expected to sign a four-and-a-half-year deal at Stamford Bridge having agreed personal terms following negotiations undertaken by his agent, Alessandro Lucci. He may attend the Premier League leaders\xe2\x80\x99 game against the champions, Manchester City, on Saturday evening before returning to Italy to await international clearance with his new team\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Aston Villa next Saturday likely to provide him with his debut.</p> <p>Vincenzo Montella, the Fiorentina manager, said on Friday afternoon: \xe2\x80\x9cI want to be honest: it [the sale of Cuadrado] was something that had to be done. As a coach I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry because technically he is such a good player but the club has made \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8bthe right decision. We get a great player in Salah although we will need some time to adapt to each other. Salah is not quite the same player as Cuadrado and can\xe2\x80\x99t play as a quinto, so we will need a \xe2\x80\x98vice-Joaquin\xe2\x80\x99.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIs is a distraction? We are used to it. It is not anyone\xe2\x80\x99s fault and we can\xe2\x80\x99t use Cuadrado\xe2\x80\x99s exit as an excuse for tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s game. Could we have kept Cuadrado until the summer? Yes, possibly but he always gave everything for the club and he would have done again if he had played tomorrow. He is an ultimate professional and I am happy for him because he is joining a big club. We have to show that Cuadrado is not the only reason we are where we are.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
