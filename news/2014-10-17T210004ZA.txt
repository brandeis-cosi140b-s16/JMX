b'Aitor Karanka is starting to make the difference for Middlesbrough'


b'<p>Aitor Karanka knew he would be happy at Middlesbrough by the end of his first evening as the club\xe2\x80\x99s manager. The Spaniard had been out for dinner with Steve Gibson and was slightly surprised when Boro\xe2\x80\x99s owner joined him on the walk back to his new home in a nearby apartment complex.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLeo Percovich, my goalkeeping coach, was there too and when Steve came with us after we left the restaurant we thought he must live in the same block,\xe2\x80\x9d said Karanka, who completes his first year at the Riverside next month. \xe2\x80\x9cSteve was asking if everything was all right and whether we needed anything but when the lift arrived he suddenly said \xe2\x80\x98goodnight\xe2\x80\x99. We asked why he\xe2\x80\x99d gone out of his way to accompany us and he explained he just wanted to check everything was OK. It was a little detail but to me it was a very big detail. Tiny details can be big things.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Like Gibson, Karanka is unfailingly courteous and a firm believer that the devil really is in the detail. Big on punctuality, he is renowned for returning reports and briefing papers containing minor spelling mistakes to their authors for correction. It is all part of a desire to create a culture of excellence and with Boro travelling to Brighton on Saturday only one point off the top of the Championship, it seems to be working.</p> <p>As Spain\xe2\x80\x99s Under-16 coach, the former Real Madrid centre-half proved an innovative thinker but his attention to the small print stems partly from a subsequent stint back at the Bernab\xc3\xa9u. Karanka returned to Madrid as Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s assistant in 2010, embarking on a three-year, trophy-studded interlude resulting in an enduring friendship with Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s manager.</p> <p>Yet even before that partnership, Karanka, now 41, boasted a contacts book most Championship counterparts could only envy. As he relaxes on a black leather sofa in his office overlooking the manicured pitches at Boro\xe2\x80\x99s Rockcliffe Hall training headquarters near Darlington, he matter-of-factly explains how he became the \xe2\x80\x9cSpecial One\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d sidekick.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a relationship with Jos\xc3\xa9 before, so his call was a nice surprise. When I asked why he wanted me he said he\xe2\x80\x99d spoken to Lu\xc3\xads Figo, Clarence Seedorf and Predrag Mijatovic [all former Real team-mates] and they\xe2\x80\x99d said good things \xe2\x80\x93 so I felt very proud.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>A gloriously intense chapter ensued. \xe2\x80\x9cWith Jos\xc3\xa9 you can learn something every single second. I felt like a doctor assigned to work with the world\xe2\x80\x99s best surgeon in his speciality. Jos\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s attention to detail was amazing, everything has to be done 100% properly. But the most important thing I learnt is that a manager has to be honest with his players. Jos\xc3\xa9 was always very honest and I try to be the same.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Karanka believes candour can negate the need for clubs to employ sports psychologists. \xe2\x80\x9cHonesty is the best psychologist,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cMy office door\xe2\x80\x99s always open; I like to give players explanations when they\xe2\x80\x99re not playing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Such frankness has enabled him to break with Championship convention and rotate in a manner almost unprecedented at this level. It is common for Karanka to make four or five changes per game but, so far, Boro\xe2\x80\x99s players are buying into a policy designed to keep them fit, fresh and focused. \xe2\x80\x9cRotation concentrates minds,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt makes players think \xe2\x80\x93 and, with so many games, people burn out if you don\xe2\x80\x99t rotate.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>After radically remodelling his squad during the summer \xe2\x80\x93 (when seven recruits signed, five loanees arrived, 11 players were offloaded and four were loaned out) \xe2\x80\x93 Karanka now has two strong contenders for every position.</p> <p>Just as importantly, there is a healthy blend between imported talents including Kike, a prolific Spanish striker, English staples such as the impressive Grant Leadbitter and academy graduates such as Ben Gibson, the owner\xe2\x80\x99s nephew.</p> <p>Then there is the Tottenham connection. While Patrick Bamford, Kenneth Omeruo and Jamal Blackman were borrowed from Chelsea, Spurs have placed Ryan Fredericks and Milos Veljkovic in Karanka\xe2\x80\x99s care. \xe2\x80\x9cI took my coaching licences with Mauricio Pochettino and know him very well,\xe2\x80\x9d the Middlesbrough manager says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe worked together on three courses, Mauricio\xe2\x80\x99s someone I talk to a lot.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>These days Karanka speaks English with an impressive fluency and grasp of nuance but it was not always so. \xe2\x80\x9cI played in Denver [with Colorado Rapids] for a while so I\xe2\x80\x99d learnt a bit,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t very good. We had a practice match in one of my first training sessions here. I told the goalkeeper to \xe2\x80\x9cwait, wait\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 except I said \xe2\x80\x9cwhite, white\xe2\x80\x9d. The lads said: \xe2\x80\x9cGaffer, it\xe2\x80\x99s reds v yellows.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Back in 2005 Karanka would have trained on the very same pitch had Steve McClaren succeeded in signing him from Athletic Bilbao. \xe2\x80\x9cI always wanted to play in England,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it was transfer-deadline day and they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t finish the paperwork in time, there was a problem converting euros into pounds.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He and his wife and children \xe2\x80\x93 a 12-year-old son and a daughter who is nine on Wednesday \xe2\x80\x93 are delighted to have finally relocated to Teesside. \xe2\x80\x9cNorth-east England and Newcastle especially remind me of the Basque country,\xe2\x80\x9d says Karanka, who was born and bred in Vitoria-Gasteiz, the Basque capital. \xe2\x80\x9cWe like Newcastle, the restaurants are good and it\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting city, but we want to get to know the whole region well. That\xe2\x80\x99s important so we like visiting places like York and Whitby. We\xe2\x80\x99re very happy, the people here are fantastic.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Despite quietly revolutionising Boro\xe2\x80\x99s playing philosophy and transfer-market strategy, he is anxious to retain links with the club\xe2\x80\x99s past. Accordingly Gary Gill, a locally born member of Bruce Rioch\xe2\x80\x99s team of the 80s, occupies an adjacent office in his capacity as head of European recruitment, while Craig Hignett is assistant manager.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cCraig\xe2\x80\x99s very important,\xe2\x80\x9d says Karanka. \xe2\x80\x9cHe scored the first goal at the Riverside [in a 2-0 win against Chelsea in 1995] so he\xe2\x80\x99s part of club history. Craig\xe2\x80\x99s like me at Madrid. I was the person who told Jos\xc3\xa9 things he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know \xe2\x80\x93 about Spain, other teams, people\xe2\x80\x99s secrets.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Further assistance comes from a dressing-room source. Jonathan Woodgate\xe2\x80\x99s invariably stellar first-team appearances may be rationed by injury problems but the central defender\xe2\x80\x99s influence on the promotion campaign must not be underestimated.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cJonathan\xe2\x80\x99s always thinking about helping the team, even when he\xe2\x80\x99s not playing,\xe2\x80\x9d says Karanka. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s taking his coaching licence so he comes to me after training and asks questions. He\xe2\x80\x99s interested in team philosophy \xe2\x80\x93 and the little, little details which can be big things.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
