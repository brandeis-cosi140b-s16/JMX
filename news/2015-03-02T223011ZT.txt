b'Tim Sherwood\xe2\x80\x99s Aston Villa face West Brom test in dogfight for survival'


b'<p>At the same time as the \xe2\x80\x9cToo little, too late, Lerner out\xe2\x80\x9d banner was being unfurled by Aston Villa supporters at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park late on Saturday afternoon, West Bromwich supporters were inadvertently reinforcing the message by triumphantly celebrating their latest success under Tony Pulis at The Hawthorns, where the value of acting quickly and decisively in the face of a poor run of results is there for all to see.</p> <p>A glance back at the table shows West Brom were four points and five places behind Villa before Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s first league game in charge, a 1-0 win over Hull City on 10 January. Less than two months later, Albion make the short trip to Villa Park on Tuesday re-energised and transformed, six places and eight points better off than their neighbours, who they also face in the FA Cup quarter-final on Saturday, and with Premier League survival within touching distance.</p> <p>While we will never know for sure whether Villa\xe2\x80\x99s league position would be any healthier if Paul Lambert had been ushered out of the door a month or two earlier, there is no escaping the fact Tim Sherwood, with defeats from his first two matches and only 11 fixtures remaining, has one hell of a job on his hands to turn around a team who have won only two of their past 23 league games and sit second from bottom.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt helps when you have a transfer window,\xe2\x80\x9d Sherwood said when asked about the comparison with Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s situation at West Brom. \xe2\x80\x9cAn ideal job would be one that Mauricio Pochettino had [at Tottenham Hotspur], where there is nothing broken. He comes in during the summer, he gets the whole pre-season, strengthens the squad with a few and he gets to build his philosophy. Those jobs don\xe2\x80\x99t come along often, most jobs come along in adversity. And I certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t turning this opportunity down.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cTime is of the essence now. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t got the time but we can\xe2\x80\x99t worry about that, that\xe2\x80\x99s how it is. But I\xe2\x80\x99m still confident and I\xe2\x80\x99m not shirking any responsibility. You can\xe2\x80\x99t tip-toe around the situation. The reality is we\xe2\x80\x99re in it but the reality is we\xe2\x80\x99ve got an opportunity to get ourselves out of it. And if we can get ourselves out of it, we ain\xe2\x80\x99t never coming in this situation again, because I will have the opportunity to build something and I won\xe2\x80\x99t let this happen again.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think there is enough to work with over a long period. I\xe2\x80\x99m just hoping I\xe2\x80\x99ve got enough time here to save the situation.\xe2\x80\x9d For the moment it is all about the short term for Sherwood, which means forgetting about the FA Cup tie against West Brom on Saturday, never mind what he may or may not achieve in seasons to come at Villa.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFirst and foremost all we\xe2\x80\x99re worried about is winning this league game against West Brom,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we do that, it will take us out of the relegation zone and we\xe2\x80\x99ll never look back.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>That, however, promises to be easier said than done. It is a measure of the predicament Sherwood finds himself in that he openly admitted it is \xe2\x80\x9cimpossible to find your best XI at the moment\xe2\x80\x9d because he is still so new to the role. He also talked about how he is trying to \xe2\x80\x9cflush out\xe2\x80\x9d the players to tap into their psyche and \xe2\x80\x9cfind out who has got the big [balls] to go and do the job\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>In the context of what Sherwood is up against, it is perhaps worth remembering when Pulis was appointed at The Hawthorns he described keeping West Brom up as the biggest challenge of his managerial career because of the short amount of time he was given to shake the club back into life.</p> <p>What has followed since is strikingly similar to Crystal Palace\xe2\x80\x99s revival on his watch last season and can be filed in the folder marked \xe2\x80\x9cThe Pulis effect\xe2\x80\x9d. Pulis was in no mood to give any insight into that description when asked about it last week \xe2\x80\x93 he is determined not to say anything that would give the impression that West Brom are safe. You do not have to be a tactical genius to work out that his premise for survival is built on the whole team being a solid defensive unit and that every player has to buy into his holistic approach.</p> <p>In Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s 26 games in charge at Selhurst Park, Palace had the lowest possession in the league (34.5%), averaged a goal per game but kept 10 clean sheets (only Chelsea, Manchester City and Everton conceded fewer) and recorded the eighth-best point return. Across seven league games as head coach at The Hawthorns, no Premier League team has had less possession than Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s West Brom side, who have scored only six goals but kept five clean sheets (only Liverpool can equal that record) and racked up 12 points in the process.</p> <p>Not so long ago Sherwood thought he would be in charge at West Brom but he missed out on the job on two occasions, once last summer, when Alan Irvine was given the position, and again when Pulis was appointed. Asked whether those two episodes would add any extra needle to the game, the 46-year-old replied: \xe2\x80\x9cNot at all, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good little club and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t right for me and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t right for them. I\xe2\x80\x99m delighted I\xe2\x80\x99m at this massive football club now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Villa manager knows the heat is on and he has no intention of trying to lighten the burden on his players.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf they\xe2\x80\x99re not feeling the pressure, being second bottom of the league, playing for a massive club like Aston Villa, then something\xe2\x80\x99s seriously wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d Sherwood said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey need to feel the pressure. We\xe2\x80\x99ve lost the last seven Premier League games and scored 13 goals all season. Something has to change, and it has to change very soon.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
