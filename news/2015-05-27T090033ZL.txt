b'Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s first season was fun, the next needs to be successful | Daniel Harris'


b'<p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf they do as we agreed then we will win,\xe2\x80\x9d said Louis van Gaal before Manchester United played Swansea, his first competitive game as the club\xe2\x80\x99s manager. Such blase simplicity seemed reasonable: only a month earlier, he had taken Holland to third place at the World Cup \xe2\x80\x93 and seldom have managerial interventions played such an obvious role in a team\xe2\x80\x99s progress. Roughly, they did as agreed.</p> <p>Pre-season sustained that impression. United beat LA Galaxy, Roma, Internazionale, Real Madrid, Liverpool and Valencia, producing passages of incisive, imaginative football, and Van Gaal asserted himself off the pitch. \xe2\x80\x9cThe discussions were very long,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of his appointment, \xe2\x80\x9cand I think they understand the timescale or I would not have accepted the job. I told them the way I worked, the consequences of hiring me and explained that I had experienced difficult starts at my former clubs. That is why we discussed a three-year contract, not one year.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Real Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s Karim Benzema emerges as target for Manchester United </p>   <p>He did well to get his retaliation in first because United lost to Swansea and then drew with Sunderland. Clearly, his summer buzz was unsustainable \xe2\x80\x93 not even Louis van Gaal could expect Louis van Gaal to proceed in that vein \xe2\x80\x93 but nor did he expect to be complaining that \xe2\x80\x9cthere were so many chances we didn\xe2\x80\x99t create\xe2\x80\x9d. In only two games he had botched an opening run that, in theory, looked capable of spurring a surprise title challenge.</p> <p>The poverty of the start was not solely Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s fault. Players he expected to arrive had not arrived, nor had players he expected to leave left \xe2\x80\x93 so he picked them. Marnick Vermijl, Michael Keane, Anderson, Shinji Kagawa, Danny Welbeck and Javier Hern\xc3\xa1ndez all started in the League Cup tie at MK Dons, where United were humiliated 4-0.</p> <p>This was a considerable oversight. With no European football, and international weekends interrupting league competition three times by mid-November, United needed all the games that they could get, particularly given the curious 3-5-2 formation that Van Gaal decided was the best way of maximising qualities and hiding deficiencies.</p> <p>Then \xc3\x81ngel Di Mar\xc3\xada arrived and, assuming he was still playing in a good team, immediately unfurled an array of beautiful passes and purposeful runs. United, however, still could not score against Burnley, so, with Van Gaal also needing to incorporate Radamel Falcao, he switched to a midfield diamond.</p> <p>Immediately, the team were liberated, thrashing QPR and dazzling their way to a 3-1 lead at Leicester. Following an unfortunately but impetuously conceded penalty, though, they collapsed, letting in four goals in 21 minutes to cover themselves in embarrassment once again.</p> <p>Rather than note a defence with Tyler Blackett and Jonny Evans at its centre, Van Gaal was spooked, his diamond deemed a fugazi. He persevered for the next two games, both at home, and United again managed moments of promising excellence to win them hanging on, before, away to West Bromwich Albion, they were sent out in a rigid 4-3-3.</p> <p>This heralded the start of Di Mar\xc3\xada\xe2\x80\x99s deterioration. A very handy winger, he had only announced himself as a special player the previous season, thanks to a deeper and narrower role that enabled him to fill two positions at once. Now, however, he was back where he started, the team no longer organised to extract the most from its biggest talent.</p> <p>At half-time, an outmuscled United found themselves a goal down, so Van Gaal swapped Ander Herrera for Marouane Fellaini. Fellaini scored within three minutes; Herrera started only one of the next 17 league games.</p> <p>United escaped The Hawthorns with a draw, and the Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 summer warning as to the intensity of the English game \xe2\x80\x93 greeted at the time with all the obvious career comparisons \xe2\x80\x93 was proving prescient. Van Gaal later acknowledged as much, discussing the uniqueness of a league in which every team has at least one match-winner.</p> <p>Next came Chelsea and Manchester City, a draw and a defeat meaning a drop to 10th in the table. A significant improvement was now established, however: big games were turned up for, and late goals were back. A semblance of United was back.</p> <p>The rolling injury crisis soon forced a return to 3-5-2 and then, at Arsenal, United could barely connect a pass in the first half; with Di Mar\xc3\xada mainly hanging around up front for breaking purposes, the midfield was devoid of creativity. Or, put another way, they were there to win, not to play.</p> <p>This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t altogether surprising. Despite his Ajax-Barcelona pedigree, Van Gaal is a pragmatist not a fantasist, all the more so with a job to keep, and so, through the winter, United were relentlessly, fascinatingly awful. It seemed inconceivable that each game, each half, could be as bad as the one before, particularly as attacking players returned \xe2\x80\x93 and yet it was.</p> <p>Still he radiated authority. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not interested,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, when it was put to him that Falcao wanted to start more games. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has to follow my philosophy. Do you understand that?\xe2\x80\x9d Even if that philosophy sat somewhere between spartan and puritan, its essence \xe2\x80\x93 trying hard, expecting to win and winning \xe2\x80\x93 transmitted to the players.</p> <p>So they tried hard, expected to win and won, the party guest who silently sits in the same seat, joylessly and methodically consuming even after everyone else has left. Artless, yes, but with conviction undeniable and, as such, numerical comparisons of the two post-Fergie seasons missed the elemental difference revealed by eyes, not stats: where once there was David Moyes, now there was hope.</p> <p>Which is not to say that Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s performance was perfect. In particular, his persistent complaining about the festive schedule not only put the idea of tiredness into his players\xe2\x80\x99 minds but it gave them an excuse for failure. No wonder that, by the New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day draw at Stoke City, he found himself observing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe buildup was not good, the crossing was not good and the last part was also not good\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Nor was fatigue \xe2\x80\x93 ascribed or otherwise \xe2\x80\x93 the only factor. For years Wayne Rooney has scored and made goals, despite playing in front of a purported midfield that bore greater resemblance to the middle of a field. Relocating him to it deprived the team of its most likely scorer and reflected the outsider\xe2\x80\x99s perception of him as a total footballer, rather than a reliable finisher who experiences occasional transcendence.</p> <p>In which context, Herrera\xe2\x80\x99s continuing exclusion became all the more peculiar. The team were plainly missing his energy and creativity as well as the mental and physical steel belied by his barmitzvah boy haircut. His eight goals from midfield have come in 22 starts; Michael Carrick, Fellaini and Daley Blind have 10 in 59 between them.</p> <p>His omission reflected a not unfamiliar pattern, dictated by the reality that Van Gaal does not appreciate risk. Having previously fallen out with Rivaldo, L\xc3\xbacio and Franck Rib\xc3\xa9ry, at United, he was largely ignoring Rafael da Silva, Adnan Januzaj and Juan Mata, while Antonio Valencia, Ashley Young and Blind \xe2\x80\x93 less talented but more predictable and controllable \xe2\x80\x93 were favourites.</p> <p>The upshot was possession without penetration, the chants of \xe2\x80\x9c4-4-2\xe2\x80\x9d heard at QPR in January probably more primal than tactical. Van Gaal explained that the formation \xe2\x80\x9ctwitches my ass\xe2\x80\x9d but this was precisely the point being made \xe2\x80\x93 for those making it, a privilege of the job.</p> <p>United carried on getting by, though, until, a month later, they lost to Swansea again \xe2\x80\x93 on the face of it a poor result but actually a turning point. Returning to the starting XI, Herrera applied a superb finish to the kind of sweeping break that was once a trademark and although the objective measure of the score disproved claims that they were unlucky to lose, things looked a lot better. They were still not creating enough chances but, for the first time, their domination was further from sterile than virile.</p> <p>Also important was the felicitous injury suffered by Robin van Persie, shown loyalty though more than two years away from a run of decent form. This left Rooney free to play up front, and he duly scored twice against Sunderland before facilitating a crucial last-minute winner at Newcastle.</p>  <p> Related: Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s Phil Jones expects strong start to next season </p>   <p>Arsenal, however, then eliminated Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s team from the FA Cup and, with difficult games imminent, United\xe2\x80\x99s season was under threat. Again they got lucky with an injury, this time to Luke Shaw; Van Gaal was left with no choice but to remove Blind from midfield, just as Michael Carrick was available to return, and then, for the first time, picked players to fit a system rather than the other way around. Finally, there was balance between skill and strength, speed and technique, and Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool, Aston Villa and Manchester City were taken apart.</p> <p>This was not as suddenly serendipitous as was painted, the previous month seeing incremental improvements. It was just that, liberated by a suitable structure, the players could inject composure with fury, amplifying the thoroughness of Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s coaching. They were doing as agreed.</p> <p>Only briefly, as it turned out, but Champions League qualification, along with wins over rivals, made the season just about acceptable in the circumstances. Beyond that, it was interesting solely because of Van Gaal; football is meant to be fun \xe2\x80\x93 and Van Gaal is fun.</p> <p>His ballooning at United\xe2\x80\x99s awards night was the latest episode of endearing swagger and spirit but he will know that, in the end, none of it can compensate for the failings of his team; next season there can be no excuses.</p>'
