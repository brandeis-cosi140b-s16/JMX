b'Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend | Ian McCourt and Toby Moses'


b'1 Arsenal will need to be on Song <p>The injuries are starting to bite again for Arsenal. Mikel Arteta, Mathieu Debuchy, Mathieu Flamini and Abou Diaby are all long-term absentees; Aaron Ramsey has only just returned; Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain\xe2\x80\x99s hamstring went against Manchester United; the similarly hamstrung Gabriel Paulista is unavailable to provide respite for the overused centre-backs; and Jack Wilshere\xe2\x80\x99s still missing after having some bolts removed from his ankle.</p> <p>With the tempting prospect of an impossible Champions League comeback hanging over them on Tuesday at Monaco, can Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger keep his players focused on the challenge at hand? One man who is certain to be fully concentrated on impressing at the Emirates is Alex Song. Song departed Arsenal for a miserable two years in Barcelona in 2012 and now returns to north London with a point to prove. Song was seemingly exactly the kind of player Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s squad was crying out for in the summer, but even the prospect of a year\xe2\x80\x99s loan was not enough to tempt Arsenal to offer him the return he so clearly wanted (\xe2\x80\x9cI would have liked to go back but they did not want to\xe2\x80\x9d). He will now face off in the midfield against Francis Coquelin but it\xe2\x80\x99s the battle against his emotions that may be key to Song and West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s hopes on the Cameroonian\xe2\x80\x99s first return to the Emirates. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are one part of my life and, because I went there when I was 17, I always say it is my family,\xe2\x80\x9d says Song. \xe2\x80\x9cI know this is a special game for me, but that is football and I have to take all the emotion out and just try to play my game, to play the best football I can to help the team to win.\xe2\x80\x9d Toby Moses</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Valencia could miss Arsenal visit after cutting big toe on broken teacup\xe2\x80\xa2 Podolski: Arsenal is still an open chapter for me</p>            Sam Allardyce hoping to exploit Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s weaknesses.    2 Time for Pardew to give Hennessey his chance in goal for Palace <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t just point the finger at Jules [Speroni],\xe2\x80\x9d said Scott Dann when quizzed about the late goal that led to the subsequent defeat at Southampton. It is what a team-mate should say but it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily true. The goal was almost entirely Speroni\xe2\x80\x99s fault. It was a tame enough effort from James Ward-Prowse and the Crystal Palace goalkeeper should have held on to it instead of fumbling it into the path of Sadio Man\xc3\xa9. In fact, had Graziano Pell\xc3\xa8 been in better form, he would have converted another, earlier spill from Speroni and Man\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s goal would merely have been the sugar on top of the Rice Krispies. But it is not just Speroni\xe2\x80\x99s handling that is looking poor of late. He seems uncertain under crosses and routinely fails to come off his line and collect balls that should be his \xe2\x80\x93 a sure sign of a keeper who is not feeling as confident in his gloves as he once was.</p> <p>Only QPR have conceded more goals at home this season than Palace \xe2\x80\x93 and they have played two games more than Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s men. The Eagles have now gone 10 Premier League matches at Selhurst Park without a clean sheet. Speroni clearly adores the club and will go down as a club legend but something needs to change. Palace are not yet safe and sentimentality cannot get in the way of Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s thinking. It is time Speroni is given a rest and Wayne Hennessey is given a chance to show what he can do. Ian McCourt</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Crystal Palace\xe2\x80\x99s Jedinak given four-game ban for Sakho elbow\xe2\x80\xa2 QPR director of football Ferdinand charged with misconduct by FA</p>             Crystal Palace owes it to fans to play better, says Alan Pardew    3 Monk needs a less narrow-minded midfield for Liverpool <p>Rewatch Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s first goal against Swansea last week. A number of seconds before Danny Rose was fed the ball by Christian Eriksen, Nabil Bentaleb was pointing to the ample amount of space out wide on the left for the full-back to exploit. With the Swansea defence pushed back, the midfield tucked inside and with Gylfi Sigurdsson determined to keep his boots chalk free, Rose had enough time to write a 3,000 word essay on the Persian elements in Finnegans Wake before swinging in a perfect cross to help get his side off to the perfect start. Should Garry Monk persist with such a narrow-minded midfield against the speed and skills of Raheem Sterling and Alberto Moreno, he can give the three points a nice hug and a kiss on both cheeks before wishing them a safe journey on their way to Liverpool. Reverting from the diamond he employed at the start against Tottenham to a formation that affords his side more cover out wide would close up the space available to Liverpool to run into and would make Swansea a more stubborn side to break down.

Not nagging doubts about relegation \xe2\x80\x93 although both certainly have reason to worry about that \xe2\x80\x93 but perhaps a mutual disdain for the man in the home dugout. One may have thought an ex-player, and a manager who earned promotion to the Premier League after 10 long years in the wilderness, would be a life-long legend. But an unapologetic fracas with fans, the throttling of a player who turned the club down in the summer, and a team that is rooted to the bottom of the table having scored less than a goal a game means that sympathy with Nigel Pearson is in short supply. How different it was three-and-a-half years ago. Pearson was in charge of Hull City in the Championship, one point off the play-off places, having taken over in Humberside after being unceremoniously ousted in his first spell at Leicester \xe2\x80\x93 with chairman Milan Mandaric showing another manager, Paulo Sousa, around the stadium while Pearson was still in charge. But in 2011 it was the Hull supporters who were furious with Pearson as, after just 18 months in charge, he opted to return to the King Power Stadium, to a side who were three places below them in the Championship. It is an act of disloyalty still not forgotten by Tigers fans.</p> <p>Both sets of supporters will be desperate for three points \xe2\x80\x93 Leicester need to get their survival bid back on track, while a win for Hull would help ease their lingering fears \xe2\x80\x93 but the manager may not receive a warm reception from any section of the ground. TM</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Leicester and Football League continue financial fair play talks\xe2\x80\xa2 Bruce set to sign new Hull contract \xe2\x80\x98in next 24 hours\xe2\x80\x99</p>  5 Goodbye Valencia (Hello Rafael?) <p>Roy Keane called Antonio Valencia\xe2\x80\x99s defensive display against Arsenal in the FA Cup defeat \xe2\x80\x9cdisgraceful\xe2\x80\x9d and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to disagree. For the first goal, he was out of position, he failed to close down Mesut \xc3\x96zil and then, in an unforgivable act of defending cowardice, turned his back on Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, allowing the winger to set up Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s first goal. His role in the second one was even worse and the Ecuadorian international was so embarrassed by his performance that he took to Instagram to say sorry. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to apologize to my team-mates and the fans of manchester united,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. Valencia has been a regular under Louis van Gaal \xe2\x80\x93 only David de Gea, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie have played more minutes than him \xe2\x80\x93 but those mistakes against Arsenal highlight what many feel about Valencia: he is not a natural right-back. Sitting on the bench that night there was a natural, and very capable (both in attacking and defending), right-back in Rafael da Silva. The Brazilian excelled for the club\xe2\x80\x99s Under-21s during the week and, should he fail to start after Valencia\xe2\x80\x99s poor showing, that sound you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear will be many Manchester United fans banging their heads against a brick wall.

Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images    6 Southampton can take advantage of Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s midfield misery <p>Taxes, death and Chelsea winning the Premier league this season. Those are the only three certainties in life. However, that title-taking will not be without its bumps and the visit of Southampton could well be one. Even before the 120 minutes of mentally and physically exhausting football against Paris Saint-Germain, Chelsea looked puffed out, especially in midfield. Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas has lost his early-season swagger. His passing is still on point \xe2\x80\x93 he misplaced just six of 80 on Wednesday night \xe2\x80\x93 but too often they are sideways and he is failing to influence games and drive his side to victory. Ramires was similarly unimpressive against the French champions and were it not for that foul on Marco Verratti \xe2\x80\x93 a challenge that falls firmly in the seen-them-given category \xe2\x80\x93 you could have been forgiven for forgetting he was on the pitch. The only problem with the exhaustion excuse, however, is that it overlooks the fact that the Chelsea midfield were totally outclassed by the PSG one. Verratti, Blaise Matuidi and Thiago Motta were excellent throughout, working hard off the ball to shut down Chelsea and working intelligently when on it to expose their faults. In the likes of Morgan Schneiderlin and Victor Wanyama, Southampton have the sort of the players that can combine skill and steel to cause Chelsea the same problems. With Diego Costa more concerned with working on getting his anger out rather than getting the goals in \xe2\x80\x93 he has not found the back of the net since the win over Swansea in mid-January \xe2\x80\x93 this could be a prime opportunity for a well-rested Southampton to inflict Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s first home league defeat of the season. IMC</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Chelsea are not panicking but must rediscover spark \xe2\x80\xa2 Blanc proves worth to Qatari backers as Chelsea are ousted\xe2\x80\xa2 Mourinho-led \xe2\x80\x98aggressivity\xe2\x80\x99 not enough to keep PSG at bay\xe2\x80\xa2 Southampton players take to the ice hockey rink during break</p>  7 A change is going to have to come for Mart\xc3\xadnez. Or else <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you are a football fan,\xe2\x80\x9d said Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez after the loss to Stoke, \xe2\x80\x9cand you lose a game, it\xe2\x80\x99s awful because there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing you can do until the next game. As a manager, I have the big advantage of being able to see what went wrong, the things not working, how we can change it for the next game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing, though. He isn\xe2\x80\x99t changing it. One of the biggest problems for Everton this season is that teams have figured out how to play against them and Mart\xc3\xadnez is struggling to find a way for his side to get around that, be that from the start or from the bench.</p> <p>The fans are certainly not happy and there is a grumble or two discharging from the dressing room but, crucially for the Everton manager, there is no indication that his hierarchy are ready to put the finger to the ejector button and send him hurtling into managerial orbit.</p> <p>However, despite the patience of the board, the importance of the game and the need for a win against Newcastle cannot be overstated. They will be helped by Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s poor form on the road of late \xe2\x80\x93 they have won just one of their last eight Premier League away matches \xe2\x80\x93 but they would be helped even more if Mart\xc3\xadnez could find a solution to the rot enveloping the club\xe2\x80\x99s form. Dropping the out-of-form Gareth Barry and Tim Howard would be a good start, as would getting more support to Romelu Lukaku, who seems to have spent most of the season doing a reasonable impersonation of Chuck Noland, only without the ball to keep him company. With all the money swarming around the Premier League, that board can only be so patient for so long. IMC</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Everton don\xe2\x80\x99t want Barkley to play for England at Under-21 Euros\xe2\x80\xa2 Lukaku rouses Everton to secure advantage against Dynamo Kyiv\xe2\x80\xa2 Everton forget their domestic slumber to keep European dream alive</p>  8 Can Sherwood win against a team not called West Brom? <p>Two ex-team-mates, managing two sides separated by just one point as they hover above the relegation zone. If QPR, Burnley and Leicester continue to put up such little resistance, then Tim Sherwood and Gus Poyet will save Aston Villa and Sunderland from the drop with a minimum of effort, or input \xe2\x80\x93 but neither can afford to rely on that contingency. At least their shared history at Tottenham should ensure there are no fireworks on the touchline, with Poyet especially in need of a more relaxed touchline demeanour following his embarrassing spat against Hull. In contrast, Sherwood is a manager who seems to rely on the pyrotechnics to inspire his charges. A poor start at Villa Park has turned around after two successive wins against Tony Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s local rivals, but he still has to prove he can get the team geed up for a non-derby game, and one away from home. There\xe2\x80\x99s little intrinsic reason for the Villa players or fans to go in to a match on Wearside particularly fired up \xe2\x80\x93 there\xe2\x80\x99s no animus between the sides \xe2\x80\x93 so Sherwood needs to demonstrate some motivational skills beyond the stereotypical blood-and-thunder tactics he seems to specialise in. Four goals in two games is a huge improvement on the club\xe2\x80\x99s recent goalscoring record, and there are signs that both Gabriel Agbonlahor and Scott Sinclair can rediscover some form to keep their team in the division. But Sherwood will have to win games against teams not called West Brom if he\xe2\x80\x99s to keep the Villa Park bandwagon rolling. TM</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Villa pitch invasion a disgrace but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mark return to \xe2\x80\x98dark ages\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\xa2 Poyet feeling the wrath as perfect storm of problems hits Sunderland</p>            Tim Sherwood says he wants the best for Aston Villa     9 A test for Berahino and a test for the Stoke defence <p>Saido Berahino turned up to watch a football match the other day. That must, of course, be a sign that he is joining that team. Ridiculous stuff, but it is the sort of ridiculous stuff a player has written about them when they are in the sort of form that Berahino is in. He has three goals in his last four league games or, if you prefer to look at it another way, 18 goals in 35 games (in all competitions). For a 21-year-old playing in a side battling against relegation and hardly jam-packed with playmakers, those scoring stats border on the phenomenal and it will be intriguing to see how Stoke cope with him. The Potters\xe2\x80\x99 back four tend to stutter and suffer at the feet of fast-paced, torso-twisting attackers, blessed with intelligent movement, players like Berahino. It will be intriguing too to see how Berahino \xe2\x80\x93 not the biggest nor the strongest attacker in the league \xe2\x80\x93 copes with the power of Stoke\xe2\x80\x99s robust defence. There are reports that Ryan Shawcross will have recovered from injury in time for this game and as Stoke\xe2\x80\x99s best defender, they well need him. Otherwise their good run of form away to West Brom \xe2\x80\x93 Stoke have won six and lost none of their last seven league visits to The Hawthorns \xe2\x80\x93 could be at an end. IMC</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 WBA threaten zero tolerance with fans bringing club into disrepute\xe2\x80\xa2 Stoke\xe2\x80\x99s Walters says that spitting is \xe2\x80\x98the lowest of the low</p>  10 Tough team choices await Pellegrini for trip to Burnley <p>If this were a regular Premier League weekend, one without a trip to Barcelona on the horizon, Manuel Pellegrini would send out his strongest Manchester City side against Burnley and not give it a second thought. However, because of that trip, the Chilean might well be tempted to try his luck and have the likes of David Silva, Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 and Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero watching from the bench or even the comfort of their couch. That would be as foolish as Ashanti or sticking your wet finger in a socket. Whatever others might say or believe, Pellegrini cannot allow his side to think that the league has slipped from their grasp and playing a weaker side when there is an opportunity to close the gap on Chelsea would be a tacit admission that his thoughts and ambitions lie elsewhere. Besides that, Burnley have already shown Pellegrini that they can fight back and given the paucity of teams around them, they are not dead and buried just yet.
