b'IT\xe2\x80\x99S GETTING PRETTY FUNKY IN THERE <p>Can you smell that stench? No, for once it\xe2\x80\x99s not The Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s grundies. Honest! They were washed last week and they\xe2\x80\x99re so squeaky clean that you could eat a steak dinner off them, while The Fiver has spent most of the day sniffing them to make sure. Sure, there have been a few concerned looks and the man from HR has been hovering for the past three hours, ready and waiting with a pair of tongs, but the point is the smell has nothing to do with The Fiver and everything to do with the foul odour emanating from the Queens Park Rangers dressing room, where, in a curious case of a rotten egg pointing out the mouldiness of its compatriots, Joey Barton has said that \xe2\x80\x9cone or two\xe2\x80\x9d bad eggs have ruined their season after their 6-0 shellacking at Manchester City sent them tailspinning into the Championship. It\xe2\x80\x99s getting pretty funky in there. It cannot have been easy for Chris Ramsey to hold his nose while he was doing his team-talks.</p> <p>Farewell, then, QPR, their relegation confirmed in the lamest manner imaginable. To be fair to the lads, for they are a great bunch of lads, it did take until the fourth minute before Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero opened the floodgates for City. Let\xe2\x80\x99s not be too harsh on them \xe2\x80\x93 even though QPR played with such gutlessness as if their players had played the entire match while wearing rat costumes, only taking a break from ducking out of challenges, misplacing passes, running into each other and giving away comical goals so that they could ask their agents to book them some swimming lessons in preparation for the mass jump off the sinking Loftus Road ship. In fact, they might as well have stood in front of their long-suffering supporters and formed a human middle finger. Unlike Burnley, QPR will not be missed.</p> <p>And there will be no end to the farce yet, QPR\xe2\x80\x99s plummet from the Premier League setting them on a collision course with the Football League, who are primed to slap them with a \xc2\xa358m fine for financial fair play breaches. The club submitted their accounts for the 2013-14 season to the League \xe2\x80\x93 they were promoted from the Championship that season \xe2\x80\x93 and what has the authorities in a tither is a \xc2\xa360m income injection classed as an \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional item\xe2\x80\x9d in the accounts which was to write off loans. Without that money from the club\xe2\x80\x99s owners, the loss would have been \xc2\xa369.7m. According to people cleverer than The Fiver, the League\xe2\x80\x99s position is that such equity injections by club owners are not permitted. Oh, QPR!</p> <p>Yet unlike, say, QPR\xe2\x80\x99s midfield, this one could run and run. QPR have vowed to challenge the legality of the fine, although let\xe2\x80\x99s hope their lawyers don\xe2\x80\x99t take any tips on defending from them. \xe2\x80\x9cLegal proceedings are ongoing as between Queens Park Rangers and the Football League,\xe2\x80\x9d a joint statement from QPR and the Football League said. \xe2\x80\x9cQPR challenges the legality of the Football League\xe2\x80\x99s Championship financial fair play rules and any charge against QPR (if any) for breach of FFP Rules shall not be commenced pending the outcome of that challenge. The proceedings are confidential in nature and neither party is entitled to comment upon the proceedings until the independent arbitral panel has delivered its decision.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>At least QPR\xe2\x80\x99s fans will have had their pain soothed this morning by hearing Harry Redknapp\xe2\x80\x99s take on their predicament and if there is one thing we can all agree on, it is surely that no one begrudges him not having a third relegation added to his CV. T\xe2\x80\x99riffic! \xe2\x80\x9cThe thing they have got in their favour is they have a fantastic chairman, a good board, and they have got good supporters as well, who are very loyal to the club,\xe2\x80\x9d Redknapp y\xe2\x80\x99knowed. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you have to be realistic. Nine of the 11 were playing in the Championship last year and, at the end of the day, we fell short. We weren\xe2\x80\x99t good enough.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Hmm. We\xe2\x80\x99ll have to end it here, The Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s knee is starting to hurt.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Jacob Steinberg from 8pm BST for MBM coverage of Arsenal 2-0 Swansea. </p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI went for a fist pump while jumping up at the same time. The next thing I knew I had gone through the ceiling\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ipswich fan Ross Morgan got a bit too excited after Paul Anderson scored the equaliser in the Championship play-off semi-final against Norwich. Lucky for him, Anderson has offered to foot the bill to the damaged ceiling.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY II <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI thought there would be a proper hullabaloo in the media if the gent in question were to be shot\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Peter Mangs, a Swedish gunman behind a string of shootings between 2003 and 2010 in Malmo, has claimed he once came close to shooting the footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic for parking illegally.</p> RECOMMENDED LISTENING <p>There\xe2\x80\x99s a packed pod for Football Weekly today, with AC Jimbo joined by Barry Glendenning, Philippe Auclair, Raphael Honigstein and Michael Hann.</p>      <p>Football Weekly is heading to Manchester!

Get your tickets here!</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWas surprised that you used a picture from Mayweather-Pacqiao on Friday. Surely first dibs on athletes wandering around aimlessly for the prescribed allotment of time before trousering a huge paycheck belongs to the Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s Vespa-riding, espresso-sipping, ice-cream hawking, greasy haired, tightly trousered Italian cousin La Cinque\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Christopher Smith.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMay I be the first of at least 1,056 other pedants to query how QPR\xe2\x80\x99s goalkeeper Rob Green is involved in the West Ham v Everton melee? Surely turning out for the wrong team must be his most calamitous footballing moment to date\xe2\x80\xa6. Oh wait\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Mike Pearson</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy husband, who grew up on a farm, now claims to have used a \xe2\x80\x9cmini front-end loader called a Bobcat\xe2\x80\x9d (a junior version of a bulldozer that is steered on the same principle) to clean out chicken houses. He confirms Jon Axon\xe2\x80\x99s statement that pushing the right-hand lever forward &amp; pulling the left-hand one back would cause a bulldozer to turn left, but adds that it would likely continue to pivot &amp;, in his words, \xe2\x80\x9cspin in a circle.\xe2\x80\x9d For a gentler left turn \xe2\x80\x9csuch as you would make in a car,\xe2\x80\x9d he recommends pushing the right-hand lever forward &amp; leaving the left in neutral. Given his professed inability for the last ten years to steer heavy wheeled suitcases, luggage carts, supermarket trolleys and vacuum cleaners, he clearly has experience of spinning something, very likely agricultural\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ann W.

That\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x9d tooted Pep.</p> <p>Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s all-round defensive hardman Branislav Ivanovic reckons that despite Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s complete lack of track record of giving game-time to anyone younger than Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o, the Special One will play his special kids next season. Or at least in the next two meaningless games against West Brom and Sunderland. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my opinion we have a great generation of young players,\xe2\x80\x9d honked Ivanovic.</p> <p>QPR defender Clint Hill believes that, even though he oversaw QPR\xe2\x80\x99s plummet back to the Championship, Loftus Road nice guy Chris Ramsey should get the chance to lead QPR back up to the Premier League. And then back down again. </p> <p>Any Spurs or Liverpool fans who are crazy/keen enough to follow their teams to Malaysia this summer? Any Spurs or Liverpool fans crazy/keen enough to follow their teams to Malaysia this summer and want to mingle with the locals? You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be doing it outside the stadium as some fans there want a boycott because the games may disrupt the national team\xe2\x80\x99s preparations for the World Cup qualifiers against East Timor and Palestine. Is this the moment the global game finally reached saturation point?</p> <p>Preston supporters were so happy at reaching Wembley for the League One play-off final that they allegedly beat up the Chesterfield captain, Ian Evatt, even though they\xe2\x80\x99d just beaten his side 4-1 on aggregate.
