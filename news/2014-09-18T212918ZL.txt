b'Louis van Gaal will succeed at Manchester United, says Arjen Robben'


b'<p>Arjen Robben has backed Louis van Gaal to get Manchester United back into the Champions League next season.</p> <p>The Dutchman was a 76th-minute substitute in Bayern Munich\xe2\x80\x99s 1-0 win over Manchester City in Wednesday evening\xe2\x80\x99s opening Group E match in Bavaria, with Robben having worked under Van Gaal at the German club and when the 63-year-old was in charge of Holland.</p> <p>United won for the first time this season with Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 4-0 defeat of Queens Park Rangers at Old Trafford, and travel to Leicester City on Sunday.</p> <p>Of Van Gaal Robben said: \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t spoken to him recently, but I was very happy for him that he won the game against QPR. Hopefully now he can show that he will do very well, but he needs time. I know how it works \xe2\x80\x93 if you are not winning, you get the pressure but the management at United know what sort of coach they have got and I am very confident he will be successful there.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI have worked with Van Gaal at Bayern as well as with Holland, so I have known him for a very long time. He is one of the few coaches, I think, who can make teams play better. He makes players better. United have some young, talented players and I have no doubts that he will do well at Old Trafford. He will get United back into the Champions League next season, where they belong. They are such a big club and that is where they belong.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>City\xe2\x80\x99s loss to Bayern means they are already playing catch-up in their group in their bid to progress to the knockout phase. Roma, who are their next opponents at the end of the month at the Etihad Stadium, defeated CSKA Moscow 5-1 in the evening\xe2\x80\x99s other game.</p> <p>Robben is unsure if City can now win through to the next stage. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say. We are only thinking about ourselves and we want to go through, we want to win our games and be top of the group,\xe2\x80\x9d said the winger. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is our target and we will give everything to do that. Roma had a big win and it was a surprise. I looked up at the scoreboard after 20 minutes and saw it was already 3-0, so they are flying.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be disappointing and frustrating for City, to lose 1-0 just a minute before the end, but they have a very good team. We have done well to get the victory. We could have scored earlier because we had the better opportunities, but overall, it was a good game between two very good teams.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of City\xe2\x80\x99s meeting on Sunday at the Etihad with Chelsea, Robben\xe2\x80\x99s former club, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cThese are always special games for players to play in. It is two great teams.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
