b'<p>As Kane milks the applause, Villa are left to contemplate their sixth defeat in a row, and it all turned on the red card, with Benteke\xe2\x80\x99s daftness causing the Villa side, who were the better team until that point, to go south somewhat. A stroke of luck and a bit of oomph from Harry Kane gets Pochettino off the hook for now. </p>'
