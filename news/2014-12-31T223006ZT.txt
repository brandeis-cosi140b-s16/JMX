b'Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s Mauricio Pochettino keen to beat his nemesis Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho'


b'<p>The spectre of Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has loomed large for Mauricio Pochettino at various stages of his career. The Tottenham Hotspur manager remembers when he was at Espanyol for his first playing spell and Mourinho was the assistant manager across town at Barcelona, working first with Sir Bobby Robson and then with Louis van Gaal.</p> <p>Pochettino did not have much luck against that Barcelona team over four years \xe2\x80\x93 Espanyol beat them only once, in February 1997 \xe2\x80\x93 but he fared rather better than he did when he became the manager of Espanyol and had to face Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s Real Madrid. In two seasons from 2010 Pochettino played him four times in La Liga, losing all four, failing to score in any of them and conceding 13. \xe2\x80\x9cUnlucky,\xe2\x80\x9d Pochettino says, with a smile.</p> <p>Results have taken a similar course in England. When Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s Southampton took on Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s Chelsea last season they lost 3-1 and 3-0 while this season his Tottenham team were beaten 3-0 at Stamford Bridge on 3 December. It has often seemed that Chelsea have held a hex over Tottenham but what about Mourinho over Pochettino?</p> <p>As Pochettino prepares to welcome the man he calls a \xe2\x80\x9cgood friend\xe2\x80\x9d to White Hart Lane for this season\xe2\x80\x99s return Premier League fixture \xe2\x80\x93 the 5.30pm kick-off on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day \xe2\x80\x93 there has been the usual talk of Tottenham facing a psychological challenge as much as anything else. The same applies, on a personal level, for Pochettino.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe psychological aspect is a factor in the preparations,\xe2\x80\x9d Pochettino said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to try to change things. Maybe this is a moment to do so. We need to fight. For the fans it is very important to win and we need to do our jobs. Chelsea is a very good team but it would be great for the fans if we got the three points.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Tottenham started brightly in the fixture at Stamford Bridge four weeks ago only to be undone by errors and Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s ruthlessness. But for Pochettino and his players it was a rare blot since the home defeat by Stoke City on 9 November. The other notable disappointment was the 0-0 home draw against Crystal Palace immediately after the Chelsea defeat.</p> <p>Pochettino professes himself to be \xe2\x80\x9chappy so far\xe2\x80\x9d at the job that he and his staff have done and he believes that gradually his methods have taken hold. He has not been heard to complain so much about the softness of the squad\xe2\x80\x99s mentality in recent weeks \xe2\x80\x93 such gripes were a feature of his early tenure \xe2\x80\x93 while the squad is impressively fit and his starting line-up appears more balanced and settled.</p> <p>Jan Vertonghen and Federico Fazio are developing an understanding in central defence and Christian Eriksen is thriving in his favoured No10 role behind the in-form Harry Kane.</p> <p>Fazio will be charged with nullifying Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Diego Costa and the head-to-head will stir memories of their previous meeting, in Spain last season. Costa, then at Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid, got into a tangle with Fazio, who was at Sevilla, and he dug his finger into the defender\xe2\x80\x99s cheek. Fazio responded by balling up his fist and punching Costa in the side. Costa did not play in the Stamford Bridge game because he was suspended.</p> <p>Pochettino talked of how his Tottenham team were \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent to two months ago\xe2\x80\x9d and, specifically, the improvement in their \xe2\x80\x9corganisation, mentality and physical condition\xe2\x80\x9d. He maintains that the key has been patience, which tends to be in short supply in the modern game. Fazio, who joined from Sevilla in late August, stands as a good example of the progress. He has found his feet after an erratic start.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou always need time to settle your philosophy,\xe2\x80\x9d Pochettino said. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe it is difficult to take time in football but this is the reality. The time is important when you want to change direction. We are very happy now with the players but, as a squad, you can always improve.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pochettino has had time to assess his players and the club will listen to offers for those who have struggled for playing time under him. Paulinho, Mousa Demb\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9, Emmanuel Adebayor and Aaron Lennon, together with the forgotten man, Beno\xc3\xaet Assou-Ekotto, could move in January. With the right-back DeAndre Yedlin arriving from Seattle Sounders, Kyle Naughton may also be pressed out.</p> <p>The problem, as ever, will involve the chairman Daniel Levy\xe2\x80\x99s valuations. He would be loth, for example, to take too great a hit on Paulinho, for whom he paid a then club record \xc2\xa317m in July 2013. It will be interesting to see whether Paul Mitchell, the recently appointed head of recruitment and analysis, can have an impact.</p> <p>What Pochettino needs, though, is a breakthrough victory \xe2\x80\x93 a major scalp to fire his reign. The biggest to date has been Everton, in the 2-1 Premier League win on 30 November. That of Mourinho and Chelsea would fit the bill for so many reasons.</p>'
