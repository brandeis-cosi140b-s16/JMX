b'<p>ARE ARSENAL THE CHAMPIONS OF EUROPEAN UNDERACHIEVEMENT?</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWith their defeat on away goals to Monaco, Arsenal have now exited the Champions League prematurely for, by my count, the 17th time in a row,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Albert in Vienna. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely this must be far and away the record for the greatest number of successive failures in the competition. But is it also the outright record in underachievement? Has any other club participated in the Champions League or European Cup more often in total without ever going on to win it? My first guess would be directed towards perennial champions from perhaps Greece, Belgium or the Czech Republic \xe2\x80\x93 if not Rangers.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Our heartfelt thanks go out to Pete Waterhouse from Merseyside, a hero who took up the cudgels and ran with this one, saving us no end of hardship because it meant we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to. Over to you, Pete:</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFirstly, to set some ground rules. I\xe2\x80\x99m not including qualification matches here, only full European Cup or Champions League rounds count. I\xe2\x80\x99m also going to call it the European Cup throughout, just because I prefer that name and that\xe2\x80\x99s what I was brought up on.\xc2\xa0Sadly, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find anyone to match Arsenals sterling run of elite mediocrity: 17 in a row is quite an achievement. The best I could find was 12 in a row by PSV Eindhoven (1998-2009), a statistic tempered by the fact that they won the competition in 1988. Real Madrid failed 11 years in a row before winning their 10th European Cup, La Decima, last season.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a list of clubs who have made the most appearances in the European Cup without winning it, in which I\xe2\x80\x99ve included anyone with more than 15 appearances and put their best performance. Champions from Greece, Belgium and the Czech Republic all feature, as do Rangers.</p> <p>Dynamo Kyiv: 27 appearances (semi-final in 1977, 1987 and 1999)</p> <p>Olympiakos: 26 appearances (quarter-final in 1999)</p> <p>Anderlecht: 25 appearances (semi-final in 1982 and 1986)</p> <p>Rangers: 23 appearances (semi-final in 1960 and 1993*)</p> <p>Galatasaray: 21 appearances (semi-final 1989)</p> <p>Panathinaikos: 20 appearances (final 1971)</p> <p>Arsenal: 19 appearances (final 2006)\xc2\xa0</p> <p>CSKA Sofia: 19 appearances (semi-final in 1967, 1974 and 1982)</p> <p>Rosenburg: 18 appearances (quarter-final 1997)</p> <p>Sparta Prague: 17 appearances (semi-final 1992*)</p> <p>Austria Vienna: 16 appearances (semi-final 1979)</p> <p>* In 1992 and 1993 the two finalists emerged from two groups of four teams. Rangers and Sparta Prague finished second in their respective groups.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Some other stats Pete found interesting: Benfica won the competition the first two times they entered it but have not won it in 29 appearances since then (never more than five successive seasons), while Celtic won the competition the first time they entered, but have not won it again in 21 attempts since (never more than eight successive seasons).</p> <p>WHY DO ASSISTANT REFEREES CARRY DIFFERENT COLOURED FLAGS? </p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhile getting my hair cut recently the lady stylist told me she had been to see Spurs and asked if I know that the linesmen\xe2\x80\x99s flags signify seniority and that she knew as she had Googled it,\xe2\x80\x9d writes John Tumbridge, who got a refreshing twist on the usually banal holiday-related hairdresser chat. \xe2\x80\x9cMy obvious initial response was to scoff; somehow I managed to restrain myself, and I checked and there is indeed a Yahoo Answers-type response that suggests that the flags are in terms of seniority, but it could also be read as a sarcastic reply. Is my hairdresser correct or do we just use the different flags to show which slow, biased, shortsighted, elderly chap is which?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Your stylist is correct, John, but only up to a point. In the days when linesmen were plain old linesmen rather than \xe2\x80\x9cassistant referees\xe2\x80\x9d, it was traditional for the more senior of the pair to use the flag that was predominantly red, while his junior got the yellow one. This was in the days before the introduction of fourth officials to control substitutions and field complaints from angry managers, so the senior linesman was assigned to the touchline that had the dugouts and substitutes\xe2\x80\x99 benches behind it. With fourth officials now on the scene, the different coloured flags wielded by those running the line at football matches are purely for identification purposes, as an aid to football clubs or journalists who might need help identifying a particular assistant referee.</p> <p>Michael Walker adds: \xe2\x80\x9cNow the fourth official has assumed control of substitutions, there is no notable difference [between the ranks of assistant referees] except when the ref comes off with an injury, the senior assistant will take over or be on the touchline with the subs if the fourth official takes over the whistle.\xe2\x80\x9d And thanks also to Ciaran Barlow who provides this example of what the different coloured flags look like.</p> <p>DOES WHAT GOES UP ALWAYS GO DOWN?</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs things stand, it looks like all three newly promoted teams \xe2\x80\x93 Leicester City, Burnley and QPR \xe2\x80\x93 are going straight back down to the Championship,\xe2\x80\x9d observes Femi Ogunniyi. \xe2\x80\x9cI would like to know if this has ever happened before (in England or any other league), where all the promoted teams in a season get relegated back to the second tier.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Everton celebrate Gareth Farrelly\xe2\x80\x99s goal in 1998 but would it be enough to seal Bolton\xe2\x80\x99s fate? Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Allsport    <p>It has happened before in England, Femi, back in the 1997-98 Premier League season, when Barnsley, Bolton and Crystal Palace were relegated having been promoted the previous season. It went right to the wire, however, as reader Nathan Atkinson explains. \xe2\x80\x9cBarnsley and Palace were relegated with games to spare, but Bolton still had a real chance to avoid the dreaded drop going into the final day,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes. \xe2\x80\x9cPerennial 1990s strugglers Everton occupied 18th place going into the final game, one point behind the Trotters, but with a better goal difference. Everton started well against Coventry and took the lead through a Gareth Farrelly screamer, whilst Gianluca Vialli put Chelsea ahead against Bolton. A towering Dion Dublin header levelled matters at Goodison Park and Everton were left hanging on.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIncredibly, Chelsea fans appeared desperate for Bolton to equalise and the home support at Stamford Bridge unanimously got behind the away team. After some sustained Bolton pressure, Chelsea broke away with numbers and Jody Morris made it 2-0. Everton held on for their crucial point and stayed up on goal difference, and have still never been relegated from the Premier League.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all bad news for Crystal Palace. Tom Kelly points out that despite finishing rock bottom of the Premier League \xe2\x80\x9cthey did get into the Intertoto Cup, where they were summarily beaten 4-0 on aggregate by Turkish side Samsunspor.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>TAKING ADVANTAGE OF FAIR PLAY</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe Uefa Respect Fair Play ranking has been used since 1995 to grant three berths for the first qualifying round of the Uefa Cup/Europa League,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Max Green. \xe2\x80\x9cMy question is, which team has gone the furthest in the competition after receiving a berth from Uefa for fair play?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As several readers wrote in to point out, Manchester City are the team to have extracted most benefit from the additional Uefa Cup or Europa League berth awarded to the highest placed national associations in the Uefa Respect Fair Play ranking. In 2008 England topped the table and the Uefa Cup spot went to Manchester City, who began the 2008-09 season on 17 July with a 2-0 win at EB/Streymur from the Faroe Islands Premier League. The same scoreline at home laid the foundation for a European campaign that did not end until 9 April, when a 2-1 victory over Hamburg wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to prevent them losing 4-3 on aggregate and going out in the quarter-finals.</p> KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhich team in the current Premiership has been in the top flight the longest? Is it really Coventry City, as so many sports presenters tell us?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Graham Codd 14 years ago in 2001, at a time when \xe2\x80\x93 younger readers may be surprised to learn this \xe2\x80\x93 Coventry City were actually top-flight staples \xe2\x80\xa6 and it was called \xe2\x80\x98The Premiership\xe2\x80\x99.</p> <p>Here\xe2\x80\x99s how we answered: By mentioning Coventry City, we assume you\xe2\x80\x99re after the club with the longest current unbroken run in the top division, Graham. But we don\xe2\x80\x99t know which sports presenters you\xe2\x80\x99ve been listening to. Coventry, who were promoted under Jimmy Hill\xe2\x80\x99s stewardship in 1967, are the fourth-longest serving members of the elite. Liverpool were promoted in 1963, and haven\xe2\x80\x99t slummed it in the meantime, while neighbours Everton have held their top-flight status ever since 1954, despite their best efforts during the 90s. Then there\xe2\x80\x99s Arsenal. They were promoted from the old Second Division in 1919 and have never been away since. But, predictably, seeing as they hold the record for current top-flight longevity, the nature of their promotion that year is controversial, to say the least.</p> <p>In 1919, the First Division was extended from 20 to 22 clubs. During previous expansions, the relegated clubs from the previous season were re-elected, while the top Second Division sides were promoted as usual. So Derby and Preston, the two top Second Division sides in 1915 \xe2\x80\x93 there had been a break for the first world war \xe2\x80\x93 did indeed move on up. And Chelsea, who had finished 19th that season, were, as expected, re-elected.</p> <p>But the reasons for Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s escape were somewhat arbitrary. In 1915, Manchester United had, to avoid relegation, fixed their last game (against Liverpool of all people). They won 2-0 and sent Chelsea into the relegation places instead, but Liverpool chairman John McKenna must have felt some guilt, because at the League\xe2\x80\x99s AGM in 1919 he gave a speech insisting on the continued presence in the top flight of the Stamford Bridge club.</p> <p>For some reason however, he also suggested that lowly Arsenal, who had finished fifth in the Second, should be rewarded for their long service to the League. They should replace the team which came 20th in 1915, he argued. And so it came to pass. The unfairly relegated club? Why, Tottenham Hotspur.</p> <p>For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive.</p> CAN YOU HELP? <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWho has missed the most penalties in their career?\xe2\x80\x9d asks Richard Dennis. \xe2\x80\x9cThis stems from watching the delightful Mr Rooney missing yet another penalty against Liverpool last month, which got me thinking that he must be up there for this particular honour. I mean it must be quite difficult to miss more than, say \xe2\x80\xa6 10, as your club would be reluctant to let you take any more?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRangers gave champions Hearts a guard of honour at Ibrox on Sunday,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Roland Tye. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine many (even any) teams have experienced that at the home of Scotland\xe2\x80\x99s most successful club. That got me thinking: which clubs have given/received the most guards of honour? And are there any interesting stories in this regard (ie teams refusing to)?\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Rangers players form a guard of honour for Hearts players at Ibrox. Photograph: Jeff Holmes/PA    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHas any player has scored a \xe2\x80\x98perfect dead ball\xe2\x80\x99 hat-trick in a game, coming from a free-kick, penalty and straight in from a corner?\xe2\x80\x9d muses Rob Yeoman.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBrentford\xe2\x80\x99s Jota has now scored in the last minute (or at the very least, injury-time) four times (Fulham home, Wolves home, Fulham away, Nottingham Forest home) this season. Is this a record?\xe2\x80\x9d asks Tim Griffiths.</p> <p> </p> <p>Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com.</p>'
