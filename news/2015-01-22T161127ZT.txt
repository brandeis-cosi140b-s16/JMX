b'The Fiver | When you were 16 years old'


b'ON GAARD! <p>The Fiver neither knows nor cares what you were doing when you were 16 years old. Chances are, if you were anything like the Fiver at 16, you were drinking yellow-pack rot gut in a bush then furiously chewing gum so that when you walked in the door at 10.30pm, Mr and Mrs Fiver thought you had spent the night playing pool against yourself at the local arcade rather than drinking yellow-pack rot gut in a bush. (They knew, by the way. Oh they knew.)</p> <p>And chances are, if you are now spending your time reading this, then you were probably not doing what 16-year-old Martin Odegaard was doing today and that is putting pen to paper for a deal to sign with Real Madrid for a reported \xc2\xa33m with a reported \xc2\xa380,000 landing in his Credit Union account each week. Yes, you read that right. A 16-year-old is signing for Real Madrid for \xc2\xa33m and \xc2\xa380,000 is going to land in his Credit Union account each week. Makes you sick to your back teeth doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?</p> <p>Unveiled to a group of hacks today \xe2\x80\x93 the number of which could have filled the Bernab\xc3\xa9u a few times over and who were kept waiting for a full hour and 15 minutes \xe2\x80\x93 here is what the young man had to parp about it all: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a dream come true, it\xe2\x80\x99s unbelievable and it\xe2\x80\x99s incredible that I am ready for the best club in the world. It\xe2\x80\x99s an honour.\xe2\x80\x9d Once The Fiver woke up from that torpor-inducing soundbite, it heard one more parp from the prodigy before nodding off again: \xe2\x80\x9cReal Madrid was the best option, both from a sports point of a view and also from outside. And the best conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>That last line should calm those who took to a lazy-story generating social media site to express their concern for Odegaard\xe2\x80\x99s future. One of which was not The Fiver, which was playing it cooler than Captain Birdseye skinny-dipping in the Arctic. That was because The Fiver knows. The Fiver knows Odegaard is moving to the sort of club where they take their time with the development of young players and their fragile talents \xe2\x80\x93 right, Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o? \xe2\x80\x93 and where they have a distinguished history of nurturing said talent into their first team \xe2\x80\x93 right, Juan Mata? \xe2\x80\x93 rather than, say, just buying the biggest player in the world that year and not giving an eff about the kids. That club, The Fiver reasoned, was the sort of solid basis that should help him navigate the many pitfalls of a career in professional football. Phew!</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is probably the Hobnob actually as it\xe2\x80\x99s strong in the dunk\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s Sam Vokes gets into the spirit of the thing in a Twitter Q&amp;A. The question, by the way, was: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s your favourite biscuit?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> RECOMMENDED VIEWING <p>When the Fiver was told about our new video series we were expecting in-depth coverage of a selection of exciting chops, steaks and cutlets. Instead \xe2\x80\x9cGuardian Football meets \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d in actuality involves talking to footballers. First up: Mr Em lets Barry Glendenning into his house.</p>            FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had some issues with my virus-riddled computer not properly loading pictures in my emails, so woe is me for confusing your cute blank picture from yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver as another incident and refusing to actually read the email (as if I needed the picture to not laugh at the jokes? I know, it\xe2\x80\x99s all so silly in hindsight). Anyway, I eventually got around to trudging through it, so I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s satisfying to know that I felt really stupid\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Jose Ordonez.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was dismayed and concerned for the strength of my Wi-Fi reception when reading Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver on my mobile device. The often topical illustration was not loading and all I saw was a blank square, credited to Big Website. Upon further reading I was quick to understand the illustration was indeed topical, and probably the best gag of the whole email. This makes me wonder, if The Fiver were to publish a blank email, would it be funnier than the usual 500 rambling words simply there to bookend the Soulmates plug? And it\xe2\x80\x99s not like Big Website would care too much, I mean look at the sloppy work the photo editor is signing off on\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Jef Diesel.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf The Fiver really needs space fillers (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver), then might I suggest you write about Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s clash between Equatorial Guinea and Burkina Faso. With 12 syllables in their names combined, this was surely the wordiest meeting of football sides since, er, these two met in 2011. Prior to that, the honour must have belonged to 2010\xe2\x80\x99s Trinidad and Tobago versus Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (15 syllables). Of course, everyone\xe2\x80\x99s dream match in this sort of thing would be a juicy tie between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Democratic People\xe2\x80\x99s Republic of Korea (26, including the \xe2\x80\x98thes\xe2\x80\x99). And perhaps Bosnia and Herzegovina (nine), would get a look in. But for pure place names \xe2\x80\x93 no ifs, buts, ands, thes, democratics and republics \xe2\x80\x93 the award should go to yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s African combatants. Fortunately for you, Fifa has only seven monosyllabic members, and you\xe2\x80\x99re not likely to see Chad, Laos and Guam cross swords anytime soon. You might see Wales v Greece, though. Or you might get really lucky, with France v Spain\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Trevor Marshallsea.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI know it probably wasn\xe2\x80\x99t you, but how could you, Fiver? How could you do a feature on weird footballer websites and not include the wonder that was Aki Riihilahti\xe2\x80\x99s site. Probably something to do with spelling his name, but I remember it being one of the more interesting insights into a footballer\xe2\x80\x99s mind. How can you not be intrigued by entries such as \xe2\x80\x98Dougie Freedman Testimonial Appreciation Club\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98I am not a Borat of Germany\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ferg Slade.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
