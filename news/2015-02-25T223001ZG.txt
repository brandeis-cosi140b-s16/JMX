b'Gareth Barry: Europa League gives Everton relief from domestic worries'


b'<p>Gareth Barry has accepted the Europa League represents Everton\xe2\x80\x99s best hope of qualifying for European football next season and admitted a sense of anxiety has crept into of the club\xe2\x80\x99s recent league performances, especially at home.</p> <p>Everton are ostensibly the best-placed English club to reach the last 16 of the Europa League when they entertain Young Boys of Bernon Thursday with a 4-1 advantage from the away leg, yet Barry knows they dropped more domestic points at home in a 2-2 draw with Leicester City on Sunday after leading.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRealistically the best hope we\xe2\x80\x99ve got for a successful end to the season is to try to win the Europa competition because that would bring a Champions League place,\xe2\x80\x9d Barry said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is a massive target to aim at. There\xe2\x80\x99s no reason why we can\xe2\x80\x99t go all the way because we seem to be able to play without pressure in Europe. It is hard to put a finger on why that is the case but for whatever reason we have not been able to put a run of results together in the league \xe2\x80\x93 our points total is not where we want it to be. That creates a sense of anxiety that can creep into your play, but it is down to us to put it right,\xe2\x80\x9d the midfielder said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe scored the first goal at home against Leicester and we should have been strong enough to see the match out from there.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>When Barry was at Aston Villa the club decided to make the league the priority and it backfired. After departing Europe through sending a weakened team to CSKA Moscow in 2009, when the second-tier competition was still the Uefa Cup, Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Neill\xe2\x80\x99s side lost confidence and failed in their bid for a top-four finish at home. \xe2\x80\x9cWe ended up missing out on both targets, but we won\xe2\x80\x99t be making the same mistake here,\xe2\x80\x9d Barry said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe manager has made it clear from day one that whatever happens we want to try and win our European matches.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez has confirmed Tim Howard will start against Young Boys despite the goalkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s costly mistakes against Leicester. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter coming back from injury Tim needs all the games he can get,\xe2\x80\x9d the Everton manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a very experienced player, still the perfect age for a goalkeeper, and experience is exactly what you need in a European game.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have such a reliable character as Tim in your squad the best thing to do is let him get on with his job, then you can build for the future. If you look at the three performances since he came back, taking in the games against Chelsea and Young Boys as well as the one against Leicester, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is an issue with his goalkeeping.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot afford to be complacent against Young Boys. We might have a healthy lead but they did very well against Basel in their last game and Basel are having a great season. We need to treat the game and our opponents with respect.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Everton (4-2-3-1, probable): Howard; Coleman, Jagielka, Distin, Baines; Barry, McCarthy; Osman, Naismith, Mirallas; Lukaku.</p> <p>Young Boys (4-2-3-1, probable): Mvojo; Hadergjonaj, Vilotic, Von Bergen, Lecjaks; Sanogo, Gajic; Steffen, Gerndt, Nuzzolo; Hoarau.</p> <p>Referee S Johannesson (Swe)</p> <p>ITV, kick-off 8.05pm</p>'
