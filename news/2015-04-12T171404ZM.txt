b'<p>These are the moments when it seems as if English football is getting the old Manchester United back. They have taken their time and there are still imperfections but finally they are operating with the dynamism, the exhilaration and sense of adventure that is supposed to be mandatory for any set of players who pull on their colours.</p> <p>They played in a way that had Louis van Gaal announcing it was time for supporters to \xe2\x80\x9cgo on the streets and hold their heads up\xe2\x80\x9d and they won with so much to spare it was difficult not to think Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s position at Manchester City might have strayed dangerously close to irretrievable. This was City\xe2\x80\x99s sixth defeat in eight matches and their manager increasingly sounds lost about what has gone wrong.</p> <p>Nobody said it would be easy getting to the top of a sport and staying there but it is coming up for seven years since the money started pouring in from Abu Dhabi and City\xe2\x80\x99s owners are entitled to expect better than four wins in 15 games.</p> <p>The potential ramifications for Pellegrini are obvious but the real story here was of the re-emergence of one of the great forces. United were ruthless once they had shaken off the jolt of Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero\xe2\x80\x99s early goal. The plodding football we saw earlier in the season has been replaced by the old, thrilling excitement and the volume was turned high. Old Trafford, for the first time in a long time, seemed like a contented place.</p> <p>\xc3\x81ngel Di Maria and Radamel Falcao, the two players who were supposed to spearhead Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s first season in charge, did not even set foot on the pitch until it was 4-1. Yet Van Gaal always did say the team\xe2\x80\x99s structure was more important to him than selecting players based purely on their reputations and, slowly but surely, the evidence is being seen.</p> <p>Who could have thought, for example, that one of the forgotten men, Ashley Young, would hold this kind of influence when the superstars started arriving? Or that the coach who once led a brilliant, slick Ajax side to the European Cup would ever laud Marouane Fellaini\xe2\x80\x99s ability to \xe2\x80\x9cplay the ball to the same colour [shirt] every time\xe2\x80\x9d? Young and Fellaini have taken turns as the two players United\xe2\x80\x99s crowd disliked the most. Yet Fellaini is now being acclaimed in a way that was once implausible while Young is playing with enough distinction that the watching England manager, Roy Hodgson, must be considering a recall.</p> <p>Young started United\xe2\x80\x99s recovery with their equaliser and his confidence could be measured in the moment when he subjected Pablo Zabaleta to a back-heeled nutmeg, shortly before setting up Fellaini to score the second.</p> <p>Elsewhere Juan Mata was wonderful again, particularly when it came to those triangular passing moves with Ander Herrera and Antonio Valencia. All of these players have suffered at times during some of the more difficult periods at Old Trafford, post-Ferguson. All have been coaxed out of it.</p> <p>More than that, this victory was also a demonstration of competitive courage bearing in mind the way the game started. City set off like a team in a hurry and Jes\xc3\xbas Navas really ought to have scored even before James Milner and David Silva took advantage of slack marking to set up Ag\xc3\xbcero for the opening goal.</p> <p>The problem for City was that the final whistle was still 82 minutes away. Zabaleta was at fault for United\xe2\x80\x99s first two goals. Later it was Mart\xc3\xadn Demichelis\xe2\x80\x99s turn when Mata made it 3-1 and Chris Smalling headed in the fourth. Silva was a frequent menace and at least Ag\xc3\xbcero is scoring again, adding a second late on for his first goals since 24 February.</p> <p>Yet City have inexplicably dropped away from that point on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day when they were joint-top with Chelsea. Vincent Kompany did not last beyond half-time because of recurring injury problems and it was another occasion when it seemed as though Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s heart was not in it.</p> <p>The game started turning away from City after 14 minutes when David de Gea aimed a long clearance to the left, where Fellaini and Herrera had doubled up on Zabaleta. City were vulnerable as soon as Zabaleta lost his balance and, though Ga\xc3\xabl Clichy was first to Herrera\xe2\x80\x99s cross, the ball spun off his body and fell for Young to hook an improvised shot into the exposed net.</p> <p>City, and Silva in particular, continued to move the ball at a speed that troubled their opponents but they had a raw edge. After 27 minutes Young slipped the ball through Zabaleta\xe2\x80\x99s legs, then took it back from Daley Blind. Fellaini had made his way to the far post and had several inches on the nearest defender, Clichy, to head United into the lead.</p> <p>City had legitimate complaints that Fellaini was fractionally offside, even if it was by little more than a few tufts of hair, and similar grievances about Mata\xe2\x80\x99s starting position when Wayne Rooney played him in midway through the second half. Yet Pellegrini was more concerned about his team\xe2\x80\x99s defending. Demichelis lost the ball to Fellaini in the build-up to Mata\xe2\x80\x99s goal, leaving himself badly out of position as the Spaniard ran clear to clip his shot past Joe Hart.</p> <p>Six minutes later Demichelis did not follow Smalling\xe2\x80\x99s run and the defender headed in Young\xe2\x80\x99s free-kick to beat Hart again. United were rampant and Ag\xc3\xbcero\xe2\x80\x99s late goal, from Zabaleta\xe2\x80\x99s cutback, came almost in slow motion, with barely a flicker of celebration.</p> <p>Man of the match Ashley Young (Manchester United)</p>'
