b'<p>Brendan Rodgers rounded on Raheem Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s advisers and the role they played in destabilising the buildup to a vital game after watching his team succumb 4-1 to Arsenal and slip out of the Champions League reckoning. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not a 20-year-old boy and you pick up the phone and ask to speak to the BBC,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rodgers. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t do it. Him in particular. But, of course, if he is asked to do that by other parties then that is what he\xe2\x80\x99ll do.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn the modern game it\xe2\x80\x99s something that would frustrate us all. It\xe2\x80\x99s the market. In fairness to Raheem, I brought Raheem in from the youth team so I know the kid well and I know a big part of this is nothing to do with him. Kid who is focused on his football, works hard every single day, he just wants to play his football. The kid gives me everything every time he trains and plays. Loyalty is not something so prevalent in the modern game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Arsenal 4-1 Liverpool | Premier League match report </p>   <p>Rodgers has spent time talking privately to Sterling and he reaffirmed his belief that the forward is going nowhere. \xe2\x80\x9cI had a good chat with him and given my opinion on it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rodgers. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing I will say on Raheem\xe2\x80\x99s situation is anyone can see through his football development, and financial, Liverpool Football Club is the best place for him.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe has had the opportunity to play, which is key for a young player. It\xe2\x80\x99s the model of Liverpool, the owners want to create world-class talent. He came in at 17 years of age, I deemed him worthy to come in and become a regular. In two and a half years he has proven that. He has played in a number of different positions, which has improved him tactically and technically.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Rodgers suggested that the hullaballoo had no impact on Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s performance against Arsenal. There was little he and his team-mates could do to repel some outstanding attacking football. Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s run of seven straight wins has pushed them up to second place in the Premier League table.</p> <p>While Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger tried to maintain a sense of realism about his outside chance of challenging Chelsea at the summit of the Premier League, he insisted his team would do everything to stay in position \xe2\x80\x9cif the opportunity presented itself\xe2\x80\x9d to take advantage.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe need for us to be perfect and Chelsea not to be perfect,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe just want to give the maximum in all our matches. Chelsea have a difficult programme, us too. Let\xe2\x80\x99s focus on what we can master. What we can master now mathematically is the top four.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Raheem Sterling flickers on fringes as Arsenal expose contract farrago | Barney Ronay </p>   <p>Arsenal look very well set for that, having opened up a nine-point lead over Liverpool with one of their most emphatic wins of the season.</p> <p>Rodgers conceded the Champions League was now out of the equation for him. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have been dealt two big blows in the last two games [against Manchester United and Arsenal]. We won\xe2\x80\x99t, I very much doubt, be in top four come the end of the season. There is too much ground to make up. We must focus on the FA Cup now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Already without the influential Martin Skrtel, they will be without Emre Can for the trip to Ewood Park in the quarter-final replay on Wednesday after his sending off. Mario Balotelli did not make the trip to London after deciding his knee was too sore. \xe2\x80\x9cHe deemed it not able for travel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rodgers.</p>'
