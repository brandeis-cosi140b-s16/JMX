b'Premier League fans\xe2\x80\x99 verdicts part 1: Arsenal to Manchester City'


b'Arsenal \xe2\x80\x93 Bernard Azulay \xe2\x80\x93 goonersdiary.co.uk <p>8/10 There\xe2\x80\x99s no hiding the disappointment of our title ambitions evaporating before the leaves had even turned brown and, after so many seasons when we\xe2\x80\x99ve been expected fallers at the first Champions League knockout hurdle, our capitulation on home turf against Monaco was devastating. Nevertheless, while the AKB v WOB (Ars\xc3\xa8ne Knows Best v Wenger Out Brigade) debate rages ad infinitum, most footie fans would be over the moon with a top three finish, never mind a Wembley encore.</p> <p>The stars Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez. Aside from his obvious quality, in these mercenary times a new arrival who puts everything on the line, in every single minute of every single match will inevitably be an instant hit. Also worth a mention: Franny Coquelin, who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a game on loan at Charlton in December, has turned into our Makelele-like midfield linchpin, while Laurent Koscielny deserves far more credit. The flops Yaya Sa-no-goal, Szczesny for failing to grasp the mantle instead of a pack of Marlboro, and the entire team\xe2\x80\x99s failure to step up at crucial times.</p> <p>Summer targets The rise of Le Coq has resulted in a change in priorities. After clamouring for so long for an invisible midfield behemoth \xc3\xa0 la Pogba, suddenly we\xe2\x80\x99re coveting all our competitors\xe2\x80\x99 top-shelf keepers, while there is a dearth of centre-forward options.</p> <p>Best and worst away fans Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s midweek travellers were the best. Newcastle didn\xe2\x80\x99t impress.</p> <p>Ideal montage music for Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s season highlights BB King \xe2\x80\x93 Same Old Story (Same Old Song)</p>  <p> Related: Premier League fans\xe2\x80\x99 verdicts part 2: Manchester United to West Ham </p>   Aston Villa \xe2\x80\x93 Jonathan Pritchard <p>9/10 That\xe2\x80\x99s a post-February rating, of course. Thankfully those pre-Sherwood days have quickly become a distant memory. Paul Lambert seemed to lose his confidence and with it the dressing room: we bear him few grudges, the biggest niggle being it took the owner so long to take action. Sherwood came with plenty to prove: he\xe2\x80\x99d been rejected by others and had a London swagger that rarely sits well with the average Brummie. How wrong we were. He\xe2\x80\x99s instilled the $64,000 ingredient into the team \xe2\x80\x93 confidence \xe2\x80\x93 and, pleasingly, he\xe2\x80\x99s been self-critical when he\xe2\x80\x99s got it wrong. We\xe2\x80\x99ve enjoyed one truly sensational day at Wembley, and whatever happens next Saturday, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking forward to August. I\xe2\x80\x99ve also bought a gilet and some pointy shoes.</p> <p>The stars Alan Hutton was easily man of the Lambert season. Since then, Delph, Cleverley and Benteke, among others, have been giants. Bacuna has also excelled of late. Grealish could go either way. The flops Aly Cissokho started well but faded.</p> <p>Summer targets Cleverley, a new deal for Benteke and a game-bossing centre-half.</p> <p>Best and worst away fans Blackpool were best; West Brom worst.</p> <p>Highlights montage music Conchita Wurst \xe2\x80\x93 Rise like a Phoenix.</p>     The fans\xe2\x80\x99 2014-15 Premier League team of the season - based on performances against their teams    Burnley \xe2\x80\x93 Tony Scholes \xe2\x80\x93 @Clarets_Mad <p>6/10 Expectations were realistic \xe2\x80\x93 we were hoping to stay out of the bottom three but didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite manage it. There were times when it looked possible but we were never able to string together a run of good results. I think the manager and players performed well, though, and we weren\xe2\x80\x99t too far short in the end. Perhaps the worst aspect was not getting our player recruitment right in either window.</p> <p>The stars We\xe2\x80\x99re not a team of stars, but Danny Ings scored ten goals and Ashley Barnes had an outstanding spell up front. Defensively we were more than OK, with goalkeeper Tom Heaton and central defenders Michael Duff and Jason Shackell playing consistently well. The flops Some of the new signings didn\xe2\x80\x99t have an impact. Matty Taylor missed much of the season with injuries, Steven Reid was often out, and neither of the two new strikers \xe2\x80\x93 Lukas Jutkiewicz and Marvin Sordell \xe2\x80\x93 scored a league goal.</p> <p>Summer targets With Ings set to leave, we\xe2\x80\x99ll need a clever forward \xe2\x80\x93 but I\xe2\x80\x99d also like to see a creative midfielder and an injection of pace.</p> <p>Best and worst away fans Swansea, QPR and Newcastle were worst \xe2\x80\x93 the best were those who filled our away end, and several managed that.</p> <p>Highlights montage music Calvin Harris \xe2\x80\x93 We\xe2\x80\x99ll be Coming Back.</p> Chelsea \xe2\x80\x93 Trizia Fiorellino \xe2\x80\x93 ChelseaSupportersGroup.net <p>9.5/10 The season was nigh-on perfect. We were expected to win the title \xe2\x80\x93 correction, Jos\xc3\xa9 was expected to win the title \xe2\x80\x93 and he did it with bells on. Also he did it his way, with no concessions to public opinion. Some may argue we were expected to go further in the Champions League but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we had the firepower for that. The Carling Cup was a bonus.</p> <p>The stars The brightest star of all was Eden Hazard, quite rightly named Footballer of the Year. His artistry ensured that we were never boring, despite what the media would have you believe. What makes Hazard even more invaluable is the way he dealt with being individually targeted for special physical attention by many opponents. But just as important was John Terry \xe2\x80\x93 still defying time, still putting his head where most defenders fear putting their boot. And a special mention to F\xc3\xa0bregas \xe2\x80\x93 as well as having a pretty good season, he delivered a red card to remember. The flops None, really \xe2\x80\x93 maybe Cuadrado, but let\xe2\x80\x99s see where we are after pre-season.</p> <p>Summer targets With Cech seemingly on his way we need a back-up. We also need another quality striker and, with a heavy heart, we must start the search for a long-term replacement for Terry.</p> <p>Best and worst away fans Bradford were best \xe2\x80\x93 amazing scenes when they knocked us out of the cup. The worst \xe2\x80\x93 surprisingly \xe2\x80\x93 were Palace.</p> <p>Highlights montage music One for Jos\xc3\xa9 here: Britney Spears \xe2\x80\x93 Oops I Did It Again.</p> Crystal Palace \xe2\x80\x93 Chris Waters \xe2\x80\x93 @Clapham_Grand <p>9/10 To be close to equalling or bettering last year\xe2\x80\x99s points tally and position is verging on the miraculous given the poor start we had under Neil Warnock. The club has been transformed under Alan Pardew, and there\xe2\x80\x99s now real optimism that he can take Palace on to the next level. The performance at Anfield last weekend was typical of our best moments: resolute, solid and full of flair on the break.</p> <p>The stars Mile Jedinak continued where he left off last season until a prolonged absence due to the Asia Cup and a flailing elbow saw him fall out of favour. James McArthur and Scott Dann have impressed, but the transformation of Jason Puncheon into a midfield libero this year has been a revelation. Yannick Bolasie has drawn plenty of headlines, too, and was applauded off by the home fans when he was subbed at Anfield. If he can find a bit more consistency, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be formidable. The flops I still have no idea why we loaned in Yaya Sanogo from Arsenal. He\xe2\x80\x99s contributed little, verging on nothing.</p> <p>Summer targets To push into the top ten \xe2\x80\x93 who\xe2\x80\x99d have thought that\xe2\x80\x99d be the aim a few years ago? \xe2\x80\x93 we need a top quality centre back and a striker who can notch 15 goals a season. And a new goalkeeper may also be on the cards.</p> <p>Best and worst away fans QPR were worst, Southampton best.</p> <p>Highlights montage music Depeche Mode \xe2\x80\x93 I Just Can\xe2\x80\x99t Get Enough</p>     Romelu Lukaku: 20 goals    Everton \xe2\x80\x93 Steve Jones \xe2\x80\x93 BlueKipper.com <p>5/10 After finishing in a European spot last season, it\xe2\x80\x99s disappointing to be stuck in tenth this time round. I really expected us to be battling for qualification again. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all underwhelming: to finish top of the group in Europa League and go to Wolfsburg and Young Boys and win was outstanding \xe2\x80\x93 but to flop out of the FA Cup to West Ham and the Capital One Cup to Swansea, both at the third-round stage, was particularly poor.</p> <p>The stars I honestly don\xe2\x80\x99t think we had any outstanding individuals this season. Jagielka and McCarthy played well for most of the campaign, though, and Lukaku deserves praise for scoring 20 goals. The flops Atsu, Kon\xc3\xa9 and McGeady didn\xe2\x80\x99t live up to expectations, but they were out injured for long periods. Distin and Alcaraz were both poor.</p> <p>Summer targets I hope we sign a top-class midfield playmaker, as Pienaar and Osman are getting old and injured. We need someone classy to put that final pass through \xe2\x80\x93 and another striker to get on the end of those through-balls would be very welcome, too</p> <p>Best and worst away fans Palace were the loudest visitors we had at Goodison. The worst were Manchester United, for breaking the minute\xe2\x80\x99s silence for Sir Philip Carter.</p> <p>Highlights montage music The Seekers \xe2\x80\x93 We Shall Not be Moved.</p> Hull \xe2\x80\x93Rick Skelton \xe2\x80\x93 @HullCityLive <p>4/10 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a major let-down on the pitch given the investment in the squad last summer, while the ongoing \xe2\x80\x9cHull Tigers\xe2\x80\x9d nonsense continued to cause division off it. The disappointment started early with the needless exit from the Europa League and, though there have been moments of quality, consistent inconsistency has ruled. Steve Bruce bought players who didn\xe2\x80\x99t meet the standards of professionalism he\xe2\x80\x99d established in the squad and has failed to get the best out of players who are capable of much, much more. We\xe2\x80\x99ve also been riddled with injuries \xe2\x80\x93 too many to just be pure luck.</p> <p>The stars Nikica Jelavic makes a big difference. Whenever he\xe2\x80\x99s injured, which is too often, we\xe2\x80\x99re unrecognisable. Michael Dawson improved after a tough start and, in a season where big names have let us down, Paul McShane, Stephen Quinn and David Meyler never have. The flops \xc2\xa310m Abel Hern\xc3\xa1ndez and Tom Huddlestone, who has been garbage for 18 months.</p> <p>Summer targets We need quality in midfield and we\xe2\x80\x99re crying out for pace on the break.</p> <p>Best and worst away fans Lokeren fans were incredible in the Europa League, while Man City were the very definition of \xe2\x80\x9cYou only sing when you\xe2\x80\x99re winning\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Highlights montage music The Smiths \xe2\x80\x93 Heaven Knows I\xe2\x80\x99m Miserable Now.</p>     Nigel Pearson: antics.    Leicester \xe2\x80\x93 Chris Whiting \xe2\x80\x93 @ChrisRWhiting <p>7/10 Well, it\xe2\x80\x99s just about worked itself out in a roundabout way. I was dreading writing this review and having to apologise for my cocky pre-season predictions, but as it is I\xe2\x80\x99m pretty satisfied. We\xe2\x80\x99ve gone from world beaters to whipping boys to world beaters again. And most fans in Leicester took Nigel Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s antics in good humour.</p> <p>The stars It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to look past \xe2\x80\x9cthe magic man\xe2\x80\x9d Esteban Cambiasso: it\xe2\x80\x99s been a privilege to see such a talented, composed and cultured footballer gracing Filbert Way\xe2\x80\x99s famous turf. Jamie Vardy had a great second half to the season and Robert Huth transformed our defence. The flops It\xe2\x80\x99s been sad to see Danny Drinkwater fail to flourish in the Premier League. Cult hero Anthony Knockaert has seemingly dropped off the face of the earth this season, Andrej Kramaric has failed to make a real impact, and Paul Konchesky\xe2\x80\x99s best days are far behind him.</p> <p>Summer targets Huth is a must, as is securing Cambiasso and signing a new left-back.</p> <p>Best and worst away fans Stoke\xe2\x80\x99s were very noisy; Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s struggled.</p> <p>Highlights montage music Rudimental \xe2\x80\x93 Not Giving In.</p>  <p> Related: Manchester United can replace David de Gea but goals are most striking need | Daniel Taylor </p>   Liverpool - Steph Jones  <p>5/10 It was pretty grim. We had a good afternoon back in September, a brief flurry of optimism somewhere around the start of the year and a fair few lows. But mainly we had mediocrity. Expectations that were running rampant this time last year all but disappeared by Bonfire Night. We ground out a few results to make two semi-finals but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make the final step in either. The manager spent plenty of time talking up the team and his part in the winning streak and players\xe2\x80\x99 development. There was a lot of hot air blowing around a lot of the time.</p> <p>The stars Philippe Coutinho showed flashes of brilliance and guile. Emre Can looks like he could be good for us long term. But mainly the Spirit of Shankly and fans groups \xe2\x80\x93 from our club and others \xe2\x80\x93 were the stars with their ongoing campaign to reclaim the game and reduce ticket prices. The flops Those behind the scenes and the owners who continue to show no leadership, no knowledge of how to run a club and zero regard for the supporters, but have plenty of time to hook up with Dunkin\xe2\x80\x99 Donuts.</p> <p>Summer targets Some ready-made players and leaders. James Milner\xe2\x80\x99s been rumoured \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99d welcome him for starters. And a goalscorer, too.</p> <p>Best and worst away fans Crystal Palace fans were pretty good: they stayed behind to acknowledge Gerrrard in his last game, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve been at the forefront of the cheaper tickets campaign. The worst? The regulars with their asinine chants.</p> <p>Highlights montage music The Beatles \xe2\x80\x93 Yesterday.</p>     Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero: under-appreciated.    Manchester City \xe2\x80\x93 Lloyd Scragg \xe2\x80\x93 @lloyd_scragg <p>6/10 It\xe2\x80\x99s been a frustrating season, characterised by underperformance and, ultimately, underachievement. Early exits from both domestic cups set the tone, but most disappointing of all was our total failure to put Chelsea under any pressure, which was criminal having worked so hard to overturn an eight-point deficit in the winter. Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s tactical naivety was brutally exposed against Barcelona, and whether he\xe2\x80\x99ll still be at club at the end of the summer remains to be seen. It\xe2\x80\x99s not all doom and gloom, though: our form since the derby shows that, with a few new signings, we can be a force again next season.</p> <p>The stars Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero has been brilliant, and again under-appreciated by many. We can\xe2\x80\x99t continue to merely accept his consistent excellence as commonplace: he\xe2\x80\x99s a player to be celebrated, and one of the finest ever to grace the Premier League. Another deserving of greater acclaim is Joe Hart, who has emerged from a difficult period as a much better keeper. He\xe2\x80\x99s been superb for 18 months now. The flops Fernando\xe2\x80\x99s been a huge disappointment, Vincent Kompany\xe2\x80\x99s poor form has continued and the jury remains out on Mangala.</p> <p>Summer targets An overhaul. Kevin De Bruyne, Raheem Sterling and Paul Pogba wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be bad.</p> <p>Best and worst away fans Sheffield Wednesday were best; QPR worst. They brought barely 500.
