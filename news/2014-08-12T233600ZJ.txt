b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho hails Chelsea signing Diego Costa after friendly double'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho said he was delighted with his new striker Diego Costa after the \xc2\xa332m signing from Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid scored twice in the opening seven minutes of his first appearance for his new club at Stamford Bridge. Costa took only 57 seconds to find the net before quickly adding to his tally as Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side geared up for their Premier League opener at Burnley on Monday with a deserved 2-0 victory.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can we expect? I expect Diego and Diego is a team player who works hard, he\xe2\x80\x99s not just about goals,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about his defensive work, mentality and ambition. This is the player we bought and we were waiting for since last season. This is why we didn\xe2\x80\x99t buy a striker in the winter market. We were waiting for him, we have him and hopefully everything goes well.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe looks adapted to the team and the Premier League, not just Chelsea, should be happy. Sometimes we lose important players going to other countries and sometimes we bring new top players here.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou can consider that [a bargain] because the market is crazy and the values are very high.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFor a striker like him, a champion in Spain, a Champions League finalist, a 25-year-old, we consider the price was very much in our favour.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Costa certainly made an immediate impression. A pass from Ramires inside the opening minute allowed him the oportunity to demonstrate why he was so coveted by his new manager as he finished past the Sociedad goalkeeper, E\xc3\xb1aut Zubikarai, from a tight angle to give the hosts the lead.</p> <p>Costa doubled Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s lead when he tapped home from close range after Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle\xe2\x80\x99s shot from the edge of the penalty area crashed off a post. Costa missed a chance to snatch a hat-trick in the second half and Fernando Torres also fluffed a clear-cut opening. Thibaut Courtois \xe2\x80\x93 largely untroubled for most of the match \xe2\x80\x93 had to be alert to deny Chori Castro in the 77th minute.</p> <p>Mourinho confirmed after the friendly that his striker Didier Drogba is recovering well from the injury he picked up last week. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s good. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say ready for Monday but with the quality of our medical department and the mentality he has, I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible for him to recover for Monday.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea (4-3-3): Courtois; Ivanovic (Zouma, 82), Cahill (Azpilicueta, 45), Terry (Christiansen, 86) , Ake (Luis, h-t); Ramires (Oscar, h-t), Matic (Van Ginkel, 82), F\xc3\xa1bregas (Mikel, 71); Sch\xc3\xbcrrle (Willian, h-t), Costa (Torres, 60), Hazard (Salah, 82)</p>'
