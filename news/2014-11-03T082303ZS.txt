b'<p>Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero believes a new bespoke training regime means he will not suffer another injury-blighted season like last term, and that the routine has been crucial to the striker\xe2\x80\x99s flying start to Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s campaign, with the winner in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s derby his 12th goal so far.</p> <p>Last season the Argentinian suffered five different injuries and was limited to 34 club appearances yet Ag\xc3\xbcero still managed 28 goals. In all he has had 17 separate problems since joining in summer 2011.</p> <p>Yet after suffering two more injuries during Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup campaign \xe2\x80\x93 he failed to score in five games at the tournament \xe2\x80\x93 Ag\xc3\xbcero adopted a training regime tailored specifically for him on returning to City.</p> <p>Ag\xc3\xbcero said: \xe2\x80\x9cI was given the opportunity to have a personalised routine when I came back from the World Cup which meant putting in a demanding double shift that worked wonders. It has been some time since I trained that intensely but it\xe2\x80\x99s worked really well going into the new campaign and helped my performance levels.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>His 63rd-minute winner \xe2\x80\x93 a 12th goal in 14 appearances \xe2\x80\x93 against Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium sealed City\xe2\x80\x99s first win in four games and cut the deficit to the leaders, Chelsea, back to six points.</p> <p>Ag\xc3\xbcero said the win had restored the team\xe2\x80\x99s faith that they could overhaul Chelsea in the table.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cChelsea are doing very well and they keep winning but we have to go on and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure they will drop some points,\xe2\x80\x9d he told City TV.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey play at Liverpool next weekend and we will see if they drop points but the important thing is that we have to win games.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Argentinian is currently the division\xe2\x80\x99s top scorer, but he stressed: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a long way to go.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s important to continue like that and it is important that all the goals mean that we win games. I always say that goals are great when they mean victories.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
