b"The Fiver | 'Please gamble as fecklessly as possible'"


b'<p>RAFFLE BAFFLE</p> <p>The Fiver likes nothing better than to sit down for an evening in front of the TV watching adverts for gambling websites, broken up by the irritating sports broadcasts they invariably punctuate. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s getting our \xe2\x80\x9cin-play on\xe2\x80\x9d with the giant disembodied head of an overweight c0ckney spiv or just a bit of \xe2\x80\x9cwot you after\xe2\x80\x9d with a generic stunnah and her $tevie Mbe-impersonating sidekick, we particularly enjoy the insincere post-script in which we are advised to please \xe2\x80\x9cenjoy gambling responsibly\xe2\x80\x9d. To the Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s ears, the subtext is clear: \xe2\x80\x9cPlease gamble as fecklessly as possible\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>One football club who didn\xe2\x80\x99t gamble responsibly is Sky Bet Championship side Nottingham Forest, currently ninth in the Sky Bet Championship table, who were hit with a transfer embargo preventing them from signing any new players during the January transfer window, having been found to be in breach of FFP rules after recording losses last season, when they were also in the Sky Bet Championship. Still, having shipped losses like that it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if they had a spare couple of hundred grand knocking around with which to splurge on reinforcements next month, eh?</p> <p>Oh.</p> <p>This morning at Wembley, in a ceremony hosted by an excitable Scotsman and the woman in a yellow dress who sits beside him on television, the names of nine clubs nominated to win a \xc2\xa3250,000 transfer kitty from Sky Bet by various supporters who like a punt were thrown in a tombola and given a good swirl. And in a state of affairs that was in no way embarrassing or awkward for the Sky Bet Football League, or any satellite television company associated with it, the independent Football League director Richard Bowker proceeded to draw Nottingham Forest, who, like many clubs, got a little bit too greedy during the Sky era and are now paying the price.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been great that our title sponsors Sky Bet and all 72 Football League clubs have come together, and it has seen a response from over 70,000 fans,\xe2\x80\x9d said Football League chief executive Shaun Harvey, who knows a thing or two about clubs which have sailed close to the financial wind. \xe2\x80\x9cNottingham Forest will be very worthy winners and can use the money for loan fees or loan-players\xe2\x80\x99 wages, but not for transfer fees.\xe2\x80\x9d Whether or not they\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to irresponsibly stick the lot on Chelsea to beat their hated rivals Derby County 3-0 in the Milk Cup at the odds of 10-1 being offered by the Sky Bet Championship sponsors tonight remains unclear, but the Fiver thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s worth a punt.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Jacob Steinberg from 7.45pm GMT for MBM coverage of Derby 0-3 Chelsea in the Coca-Cola Cup.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>10.12am, 15 December: \xe2\x80\x9cGood morning. Yes, bad result on Sat. Read your messages reflecting over weekend. Embracing challenge to turn it around. We can do it together\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Reading boss and recent Twitter arrival Nigel Adkins gets his social media on in the wake of the 6-1 defeat at Birmingham. </p> <p>5.35pm, 15 December: Reading decide they can\xe2\x80\x99t do it together and sack him. Steve Clarke has since been appointed boss.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if Gazprom has been riffed on before, but, in spite of the current geopolitical tensions and the fact that it represents the rampant commercialisation of football, I think the thing I find most upsetting about their Big Cup advert is the fact that an attacking player seems to be closing down the keeper in the box for a goal-kick. Surely we all know that the ball does not become live until it leaves the 18-yard box, meaning that the ad\xe2\x80\x99s creators either are unaware of the rules or just don\xe2\x80\x99t care. Yours huffily\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Michael Turner.</p>      <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI spotted this yesterday and thought you should be made aware. It might go some way to explaining why Louis van Gaal said that Falcao can only play 20 minutes per game\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 David Lovett [other apps are available \xe2\x80\x93 Fiver Ed].</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
