b'<p>Raheem Sterling has confirmed he rejected Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s offer of a \xc2\xa3100,000-a-week contract not as a \xe2\x80\x9cmoney-grabbing 20-year-old\xe2\x80\x9d but to assess his prospects of success at the highest level come the end of the season.</p> <p>The England international made the admission in a BBC interview on Wednesday, given in response to accusations he is holding Liverpool to ransom over a new deal. Sterling states during the 27-minute interview that football ambition is behind his non-commitment, rather than financial gain, and provides no assurance his long-term future lies at Anfield.</p>  <p> Related: Theo Walcott\xe2\x80\x99s toils loom large in Raheem Sterling contract stand-off | Paul Wilson </p>   <p>He also admits being \xe2\x80\x9cquite flattered\xe2\x80\x9d by reported interest from Arsenal, one of several clubs alert to the contract dispute along with Chelsea and Manchester City, and claims he would have accepted less than \xc2\xa3100,000-a-week from Liverpool had they offered a contract last season.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not about the money at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sterling, who is on \xc2\xa335,000 a week with Liverpool until 2017. \xe2\x80\x9cNever once in my life has it been about money. I talk about winning trophies throughout my career. I don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about how many cars I\xe2\x80\x99m going to drive or how many houses I\xe2\x80\x99ve got. I just purely want to be the best I can be.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He added: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be perceived as a money-grabbing 20-year-old. I want to be seen as a 20-year-old kid who loves playing football and doing his best for the team. I never want the fans to think bad of me but it has been too much for me this season with everyone talking about it [the contract] and I just want to get through this season and be part of want we want to achieve.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Brendan Rodgers revealed recently that Sterling and his intermediary, Aidy Ward, had put talks on hold having failed to make progress since they commenced in October. The Liverpool manager claimed the decision stemmed from Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s desire to concentrate on football but, as the BBC interview demonstrates, the situation has since intensified.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI will definitely give guarantees at the end of the season. I\xe2\x80\x99m just focusing on my football,\xe2\x80\x9d was Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s reply when asked if he would be a Liverpool player in June. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is my career and I want the best for me and to reach the goals I had as a kid.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Sterling described Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa3100,000-a-week, five-year contract offer as \xe2\x80\x9cflattering\xe2\x80\x9d but said it would remain unsigned while he focused on Champions League qualification and winning the FA Cup. \xe2\x80\x9cI just want to focus on football and at the end of the season assess my position of where I am as a 20-year-old in the Premier League.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The forward claimed his future could have been resolved after last season\xe2\x80\x99s title challenge. He added: \xe2\x80\x9cIf, at that point in time, I was offered a contract, I most definitely would have signed straight away and probably for far less money than is being said now. I think the timing was a bit off.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Sterling celebrates scoring for England against Lithuania last week with Wayne Rooney. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters    <p>Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez\xe2\x80\x99s departure for Barcelona last summer and Steven Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s impending exit have left \xe2\x80\x9ca little dent\xe2\x80\x9d according to Sterling, although he backed Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s emerging talent to emulate the pair\xe2\x80\x99s achievements and claims Anfield and Rodgers are \xe2\x80\x9cgreat\xe2\x80\x9d for young players. He also insists playing up front is \xe2\x80\x9cwhere I see myself\xe2\x80\x9d and his recent switch to wing-back \xe2\x80\x93 cited as a potential cause of conflict with Rodgers \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cis difficult for me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Sterling is fit for Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Arsenal on Saturday despite missing the friendly between England and Italy as a precaution against a toe problem. He described reports of a transfer to London, where he spent his childhood, as a compliment, although Liverpool would not countenance a sale with the player under contract for another two years. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite flattering,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s interest.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFor me it is quite flattering but I try to block everything out of my head. The next game is against Arsenal and I want to do my best. I won\xe2\x80\x99t be hiding.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The England international may get his wish to return to the Liverpool attack on Saturday with Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana doubtful.</p>  <p> Related: Football transfer rumours: Arsenal to move for Milan\xe2\x80\x99s Stephan El Shaarawy? </p> '
