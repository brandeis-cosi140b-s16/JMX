b'Diego Costa may not play again this season, says Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Jose Mourinho'


b'<p>Diego Costa may have played his last football for Chelsea this season after Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho confirmed he would recall the Spain forward after recent hamstring trouble only if the league leaders are struggling to claim the title.</p> <p>Chelsea, who are 13 points clear at the top, will secure the Premier League on Sunday if they defeat Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge and Costa will not be involved in that fixture. The Brazil-born forward has been troubled by hamstring problems since his final few months at Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid last year and, having suffered strains before Christmas, suffered a relapse in the victory at Hull in March.</p> <p>Costa missed Spain\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent international fixtures and, having been thrown on from the bench at half-time against Stoke on 4 April, tore the muscle again in his left leg and was replaced after only 12 minutes. Asked if the striker, who has been taking some part in training over the past 10 days, would feature against Palace, Mourinho said he was \xe2\x80\x9cout\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not been a setback but it just isn\xe2\x80\x99t worth the risk,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cIn this process, in the last month, if we lose a game and we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose a second match, he will be back immediately. But, because the results in the last month were always victories and a draw against the team in second [Arsenal], we don\xe2\x80\x99t need to rush him. We are trying to give him maximum stability for him to be stronger and stronger. No need for any risk.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho, who will have Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my fit to return on Sunday after calf trouble, was asked if it was likely Costa would feature again this season. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a chance he might not,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of his 19-goal top scorer. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we win Sunday, I would say he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t play next week against Liverpool. If we don\xe2\x80\x99t win on Sunday and we need points against Liverpool, I\xe2\x80\x99d say he would play against them. It\xe2\x80\x99s about judging it result after result. If we don\xe2\x80\x99t need him, probably he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t play.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Costa has begun a personal rehabilitation programme aimed at strengthening the hamstring in the hope he does not suffer similar problems, and will maintain that into the close season, with his participation in Spain\xe2\x80\x99s game in June clearly in doubt. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be a good period of work, rather than a long break,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are preparing a good working situation for him during the holiday period where he can obviously mix the holiday with work without fear.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
