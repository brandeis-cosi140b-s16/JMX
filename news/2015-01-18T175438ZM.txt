b'Manchester City v Arsenal: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened | Jacob Steinberg'


b'<p>Do not adjust your screen - Arsenal have won away at Manchester City, who are five points behind Chelsea, thanks to the perfect away performance. Goals from Santi Cazorla and Olivier Giroud won it for them and how they deserved it. They squeezed the life out of an anaemic City, in particular David Silva, and played with maturity, discipline and authority, defending well and attacking at the right moments. This is the blueprint Arsenal must follow in these games from now on. Maybe a team of son-in-laws isn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad, after all. Thanks for reading. Bye.</p>'
