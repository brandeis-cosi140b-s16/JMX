b'QPR 1-0 Sunderland | Premier League match report'


b'<p>Such was the sense of reality-biting expectation around Loftus Road, after a complex start to the season, most of the pre-match talk around the ground was bleak: never mind a win or a draw, even a goal would do as something to cling to. Not only did a tense encounter deliver\xc2\xa0that all-important goal, Charlie Austin\xe2\x80\x99s strike was enough to secure a precious three points to help relaunch QPR\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.</p> <p>It was Austin\xe2\x80\x99s first in the Premier League, the culmination of a Rickie Lambert-esque clamber up the football ladder from non-league to the elite division. Having been released by Reading as a teenager, the striker spent two years further down the pyramid, before beginning the serious stages of his climb.</p> <p>A regular scorer in the Championship, this step felt momentous, and Harry Redknapp is hopeful Austin can follow the example of some famous forwards of old. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of strikers have come out of the lower leagues: Les Ferdinand, Ian Wright, Ian Rush. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure Charlie will score at this level.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He will need to, particularly as Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my, who had been selected for the game, was withdrawn when Redknapp received a phone call confirming that Chelsea had met his \xc2\xa310.5m release clause. \xe2\x80\x9cA spanner was thrown in works at 12pm, getting a call saying Lo\xc3\xafc was leaving. It was a massive shock to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the QPR manager. The waters were muddied tonight by reports that Arsenal had also met the release clause.</p> <p>Reacting to the Remy news was only part of the reshuffle. The other notable change was in strategy, as QPR abandoned the three-at-the-back experiment that had wreaked such confusion in earlier matches and reverted to a more conventional back four. It seemed a case of systems schmystems early on, though, as\xc2\xa0Sunderland threatened on a handful of occasions. Patrick van Aanholt and Steven Fletcher both went close.</p> <p>QPR awoke from their toothless slumber when, from nowhere, Leroy Fer \xe2\x80\x93 who impressed on his debut \xe2\x80\x93 slammed in a shot from almost 30 yards out that walloped against the crossbar. Gus Poyet sensed the dynamic change. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it was over-confidence, if it was that we were so happy and controlling the game that we thought maybe it was a little bit too easy,\xe2\x80\x9d he pondered.</p> <p>Austin delivered with his third attempt in quick succession. His persistence was rewarded when Fer nodded a\xc2\xa0corner into his path, and the 25-year-old lashed the ball into the roof of the\xc2\xa0Sunderland net. \xe2\x80\x9cGoals are very expensive, and that made the difference,\xe2\x80\x9d Poyet rued.</p> <p>Redknapp\xe2\x80\x99s team may not be perfectly formed yet \xe2\x80\x93 and no doubt the annual car-window interviews will punctuate transfer deadline day on Monday (Lassana Diarra\xe2\x80\x99s transfer should be completed imminently). But as they are, they could be pleased with their second half in terms of effort and resilience. Connor Wickham, Adam Johnson and Emanuele Giaccherini tested the Rangers rearguard, which held firm.</p> <p>Poyet, too, has work ahead to bolster his resources. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not my squad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not enough. I am going to be on the phone all the time.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Such is the beautiful illogic of football that QPR \xe2\x80\x93 who lost their first two Premier League games in underwhelming fashion while Redknapp juggles to try to create a more balanced squad \xe2\x80\x93 travel to Old Trafford next, sitting above Manchester United in the budding Premier League table. Something to build on.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLike everything in life, when you are down you have to pick yourself up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Redknapp. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is how you react to disappointments that proves who you are. We did that.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI said to the lads the world will look a better place if we win, and it does.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
