b'Louis van Gaal confident he can solve Manchester United injury crisis'


b'<p>Louis van Gaal has said he will solve Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s injury crisis by applying the methods that solved Arjen Robben\xe2\x80\x99s fitness problems and the manager is also confident that his players will click soon.</p> <p>United have five points from the opening five games and have won just once. Last Sunday the side capitulated at Leicester City, allowing four unanswered goals in 21 second-half minutes to lose 5-3.</p> <p>Van Gaal has nine players injured for Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s visit of West Ham United. Three of these, Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans, are frontline centre-backs and Tyler Blackett, who has been given a regular chance in the position, is also unavailable due to his red card at Leicester. While Van Gaal admitted this will force him to draft in reinforcements from the under-21 squad, he is aware of the various fitness problems that have dogged Smalling, Jones and Evans during their United careers.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI have been told [about this] and now they are confirming [it]. But I have good hopes that we shall improve in that matter because normally I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any injuries,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, before citing the case of Robben when Van Gaal was in charge of Bayern Munich from 2009-11. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a good example, for a player who was many times injured \xe2\x80\x93 Robben \xe2\x80\x93 he was never injured [during my reign].\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Asked precisely how he will ensure the injuries stop, Van Gaal said: \xe2\x80\x9cBy training. By training sessions and adapting to their level. It was not only Robben but every player. And we are doing that here in the same way, only less than I have done with Bayern Munich. We have to improve the level and intensity so players can play the game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Gaal insists his methods will work even on the injury-prone Smalling, Jones and Evans. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m 25 years in this profession and you learn every year but you gain a philosophy in all the years and apply that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The defensive trio are all predominantly right-sided and Van Gaal suggested the club may have tried to sign another during the summer window. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe we were in the market already in August for a right central defender. You never know. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to discuss that with you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>United\xe2\x80\x99s disappointing results have come against some lesser teams, with Swansea City winning at Old Trafford and Burnley and Sunderland managing home draws, alongside Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s victory. Van Gaal has started slowly at some of his previous clubs. In his opening season at Bayern, his side were seventh after 13 matches yet went on to win the title. In 1998-99 Barcelona were 10th after 14 games and won La Liga.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe give a lot of information [to the players] and you have to work out that information,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have said that before. There shall be a moment in the season when this information is too much \xe2\x80\x93 maybe at this moment it is too much for the players, but I have already said it\xe2\x80\x99s more [about] advice. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to be yourself, you have your own identity. But that\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult because we are starting with a new team, a new relationship between players, so that\xe2\x80\x99s why it needs time. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say that all the time because all the fans are very tired of hearing that sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Gaal said initially that his squad would need three months to click and from 26 October, which is around that mark, United face Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal in three of their next four games. The Dutchman is optimistic the players will be comfortable with his approach by then. \xe2\x80\x9cYou never know. I hope it is like that. In all my former clubs it has worked like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the 63-year-old, before citing Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s reverse. \xe2\x80\x9cIt did surprise me that from leading 3-1 we lost 3-5. I have a lot of experience but I never had an experience of five goals against.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He added regarding his defence: \xe2\x80\x9cMy concern is never the age or the experience. My concern is the profile and you have to fit in the profile and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to buy players who don\xe2\x80\x99t. There are a lot of defenders in the world but I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to buy any defender. I want to buy defenders who fit in the profile.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I like and age is not so important. I played with the Dutch national team, with Bruno Martins Indi and Stefan de Vrij \xe2\x80\x93 both 22. Never played in the Premier League or abroad. Now they are abroad because of the World Cup. I played with Ron Vlaar and he plays with Aston Villa. That was my defence and we did very well at the World Cup and until Leicester we [United] had only three goals against in spite of the fact we were not playing so well.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOur defensive organisation was very good and also in the United States [in pre-season] it was very good. But now you want to make everything negative, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not true. We scored three goals, Van Persie had a chance to make it four but then it was over.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
