b'Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho to unleash Diego Costa despite sharpness fears'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho fears Diego Costa has been blunted by a recent domestic three-match ban, as he prepares to throw the forward straight back into the fray against Paris Saint-Germain.</p> <p>Costa, who was suspended for a stamp on Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Emre Can, has not featured for three weeks, with that enforced lay-off prompting Mourinho to organise a practice game behind closed doors at the end of last week aimed at granting the 26-year-old a semi-competitive run-out. The striker is the club\xe2\x80\x99s top scorer this season with 17 goals in 19 Premier League games and, despite rustiness, will make an immediate return to the side.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe will start but a long rest is not good for him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho who, like Costa, vehemently contested the suspension. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s good for a player to be three weeks, or three matches, without starting a game. So I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be in the best condition. A little rest is welcome for everyone; a big rest isn\xe2\x80\x99t good for the players. So we are not going to see the best Diego. I hope I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong, but probably he will need this game to try to get back to his best.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe organised a game three or four days ago with the kids for him to compete in. We tried to replicate competition for him but it\xe2\x80\x99s different. I know he has hunger to play, a big appetite to play, and the Champions League scenario is a scenario that every player enjoys. And, at the same time, [Lo\xc3\xafc] R\xc3\xa9my and [Didier] Drogba have played in the last three matches. Obviously it\xe2\x80\x99s important for them to have had minutes and confidence and I know that I have them both ready for the game, too.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Costa\xe2\x80\x99s last goal in European competition was for Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid against Chelsea. Mourinho had hoped his \xc2\xa332m summer signing would prove the significant difference between his team and PSG. Last season\xe2\x80\x99s 3-1 defeat at Parc des Princes in the first leg of the quarter-final had prompted him to bemoan the lack of attacking options at his disposal at the time, with Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o absent injured and Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle having been preferred to Fernando Torres or Demba Ba from the start. That quartet have since moved on.</p> <p>Mourinho will hope his revamped frontline wounds PSG, whose preparations had been severely undermined by a flurry of injuries sustained during Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s wasteful 2-2 draw with Caen. Serge Aurier, Yohan Cabaye and Lucas Moura will miss the game, though Laurent Blanc ended Monday night\xe2\x80\x99s training session encouraged that Marquinhos, Blaise Matuidi and Thiago Motta would be fit having taken part in the session.</p> <p>The French champions\xe2\x80\x99 manager has warned his players Mourinho will seek to \xe2\x80\x9craise the temperature on the pitch\xe2\x80\x9d and urged them to remain calm and not react to any provocation in what will be a keenly contested occasion. Blanc was asked specifically about his young Italy midfielder Marco Verratti, whose temperament has proved suspect. \xe2\x80\x9cWith him, it\xe2\x80\x99s about how he controls his temper,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has to show he has improved on that level. I know Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho a bit and I know he\xe2\x80\x99ll raise the temperature on the pitch. So my players need to be cold, they need to be calm and they mustn\xe2\x80\x99t react even when it is hot out there on the turf. They must stay calm and cold. We can\xe2\x80\x99t afford any more yellow cards. It\xe2\x80\x99s a real test for Marco, but I think he has matured and will cope with it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho, who will hand Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas a first start since the midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s recovery from a hamstring injury, declined to comment on Blanc\xe2\x80\x99s remarks.</p>'
