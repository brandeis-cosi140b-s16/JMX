b'Chelsea v Manchester City: match preview'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has \xe2\x80\x98empirical evidence\xe2\x80\x99 that the world is against him. His star striker\xe2\x80\x99s unwitting tread on the foot of an opponent has been \xe2\x80\x98distorted\xe2\x80\x99 into a stamping storm and suspension while the Chelsea manager himself is \xc2\xa325,000 lighter for having had the temerity to suggest that the world is indeed against him. He might be without not only Diego Costa but Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas, who has a hamstring issue, against a City side who are having a wobble. Expect more fireworks.
