b'Juli\xc3\xa1n Speroni: the kid from Buenos Aires who became a Crystal Palace legend'


b'<p>Juli\xc3\xa1n Speroni is sitting at a table in the restaurant he co-owns, sunlight streaming in past the bottles of wine and olive oil perched in the window and the goalkeeper oblivious to the gridlock of the mid-afternoon school run choking Purley Cross outside. He has been asked to rattle off a list of the most talented players alongside whom he has lined up for Crystal Palace. A few throwaway names would do for his undemanding audience but, even putting politics aside, he seems genuinely stumped. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s so tough,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to remember that, before this season, I\xe2\x80\x99d played with almost 200 team-mates at Palace. Probably more.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The excuses, however justified, do eventually give way to an answer. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a defender I\xe2\x80\x99d say Gonzalo Sorondo, someone we didn\xe2\x80\x99t see enough of because of injuries, but what a player. Technically, so strong. When it comes to natural talent I saw Victor Moses going from academy to first team and Wilfried Zaha too. Raw talent growing up. Look at the potential of Yannick Bolasie. There was Nathaniel Clyne and Jos\xc3\xa9 Fonte, Dougie Freedman and Andy Johnson, Clinton Morrison \xe2\x80\xa6 no, it\xe2\x80\x99s too difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d It says everything about the Argentinian\xe2\x80\x99s longevity at Palace that Moses, now of Chelsea, was 13 when Speroni arrived in south London. Zaha, then 11, was still a year away from joining the academy.</p> <p>The post-season has been transformed into a celebration for Speroni. On Tuesday he welcomes Dundee, his first British club, to Selhurst Park for a testimonial to celebrate his 11-year stint with his current team. The majority of Alan Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s squad will feature, with the manager himself to enter the fray at some stage alongside his contemporary, John Salako. Former team-mates, from Aki Riihilahti to Danny Butterfield, will play a part while the visitors, backed by 1,700 travelling fans, will include Charlie Adam, Fabi\xc3\xa1n Caballero and Temuri Ketsbaia in their number.</p> <p>The 36-year-old goalkeeper will be feted by those in the Holmesdale who once draped a banner from top to bottom tier acclaiming their very own Manos de Dios. Speroni himself is still struggling to comprehend the level of adulation. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen they did that for my 250th game, I\xe2\x80\x99d gone out on the pitch expecting a little flag or something so big,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, sizing it up with one arm. \xe2\x80\x9cThen I saw those banners. I still can\xe2\x80\x99t thank them enough.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Speroni often ends up pinching himself when he contemplates the journey he has made from Saavedra, Buenos Aires to the Premier League via Dundee. Or, putting the geography to one side, to mid-table in the most watched league in world football via one relegation, a painful administration and 11 different managers \xe2\x80\x93 permanent, interim or caretaker \xe2\x80\x93 at Palace alone. His story is unconventional, that of a Boca Juniors fan who had fallen in love with the game while accompanying his grandfather to La Bombonera every other week but who ended up spending time in the academy at their rivals River Plate before breaking into the first team at his local side, Club Atl\xc3\xa9tico Platense.</p> <p>There he once returned to the dressing room after training to find armed men eager to berate the team for their failings. There were two senior appearances before footage of his displays reached Ivano Bonetti, the Italian \xe2\x80\x93 and former Palace player \xe2\x80\x93 in charge of Dundee at the time, and an unlikely opportunity in Europe awaited. He did not speak a word of English and he and his childhood sweetheart (and future wife), Marina, enlisted in a Tayside college to pick up the basics. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we had seven Argentinian players in the squad so that helped. I\xe2\x80\x99d read the lyrics of songs I liked, lots of Led Zeppelin and AC/DC, and got my friends to correct me when I spoke poorly. And I played. We reached the Scottish Cup final in my first full season. I had my nose broken in training just before the game \xe2\x80\x93 I came for a cross and one of my team-mates smacked me in the face with the back of his head \xe2\x80\x93 and they said I shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t play. But I was never going to miss a Cup final. I had two black eyes at Hampden.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Juli\xc3\xa1n Speroni playing for Crystal Palace against Everton on August 21, 2004. Photograph: Jo Caird/Getty Images    <p>There were only two and a half years at Dens Park but he impressed enough to be inducted recently into the club\xe2\x80\x99s hall of fame, with the rush to book flights and hotels for the testimonial a reflection of the esteem in which he is still held. Palace, newly promoted under Iain Dowie, prised him away in 2004 for \xc2\xa3500,000, though a quick glance at a YouTube video of his home debut, against Everton, offers a reminder that his association with his new club might have been short-lived. It is at around 90 seconds into the clip that Speroni grimaces, the commentator declaring \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m not quite sure what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing\xe2\x80\x9d as the goalkeeper dawdles at a back-pass, fails to trick Kevin Campbell and ends up conceding a penalty. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s actually Tony Popovic\xe2\x80\x99s fault for passing me the ball,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a penalty. Come on, he dived. As for the hair, what was I thinking? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I was young \xe2\x80\xa6</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou always want to impress early on when you sign for a new club but at the time I had a bit of South American naivety in me still. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never stopped the ball in the box since. I look back at that now and think: \xe2\x80\x98Why?\xe2\x80\x99 I had time, I could have kicked it straight away. But I grew up playing football, passing the ball around, sometimes taking risks. I learned. If I\xe2\x80\x99d done that back home it would have just been forgotten. Here I paid a big price. It took me three years to get back into the team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>There were only 15 league appearances in those first three seasons. He did not appear on a winning side in the Premier or Football League until December 2006, by which time Peter Taylor was in charge and had offered Gabor Kiraly\xe2\x80\x99s understudy the chance to move on \xe2\x80\x9cto get some games\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cI learned a lot in those first few seasons, even when things weren\xe2\x80\x99t good and I was out of the team. Mentally I became tougher. It was necessary to have that little shock, to learn how the game was played in this country \xe2\x80\x93 different to Scotland, to Argentina, to anywhere else. Even though I suffered a lot those first few years, I could take a lot of positives from it.\xe2\x80\x9d When Kiraly left at the end of that campaign, Speroni had his chance. In the eight seasons since he has started all but 10 of Palace\xe2\x80\x99s 352 league games.</p> <p>The top flight has showcased his abilities as he made his name on a bigger stage with those trademark reaction saves. The pair from Eden Hazard when Tony Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s Palace prevailed at Selhurst Park last season were two of his best, though Speroni tends to reflect on team performances rather than personal excellence with more pride. He charts the club\xe2\x80\x99s revival to an excruciating afternoon at Hillsborough on the final day in 2009-10, when the club languished in administration with its very existence on the line. They were in the Championship and a draw was required at Sheffield Wednesday to secure safety at their hosts\xe2\x80\x99 expense. \xe2\x80\x9cThe psychology of that season was incredible,\xe2\x80\x9d he reflects. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d been playing well, winning games and targeting the play-offs, and then we had 10 points deducted and were suddenly in a relegation battle. And, just like that, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t win a game and the club\xe2\x80\x99s future was up in the air.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat game got to us all but Hillsborough was where the bond was really strengthened with the fans. Screaming at [the club captain] Paddy McCarthy in stoppage time when he headed one out of my hands and behind for a corner \xe2\x80\xa6 we were having a right go at each other when the referee blew the final whistle.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The 2-2 draw kickstarted a new era for Palace. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was when things changed for the club. New owners took over that summer and since then we\xe2\x80\x99ve managed to build the situation we\xe2\x80\x99re in now. It all started at Hillsborough. If we\xe2\x80\x99d lost that game, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where Palace would be now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Their return to the elite in 2013 was played out under another three managers and via a play-off success over Brighton &amp; Hove Albion that was briefly overshadowed by \xe2\x80\x9cPoogate\xe2\x80\x9d. Palace\xe2\x80\x99s players had arrived at the Amex for the second leg of the semi-final to find the tension in the tie had clearly already had an explosive effect. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was, well, a mess. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what had happened. Ian Holloway went crazy but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he knew what had happened. He just jumped to conclusions and blamed everybody. I smelled it \xe2\x80\xa6 but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go closer. The first I knew that it was actually our coach driver, who had been ill, was when Paddy told the audience on stage at my testimonial evening. But what spirit we showed that night.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Juli\xc3\xa1n Speroni wants his testimonial on Tuesday night to be \xe2\x80\x98a celebration of my time at the club\xe2\x80\x99. Photograph: Tom Jenkins    <p>The final at Wembley included a critical save to deny Watford\xe2\x80\x99s Troy Deeney a tap-in, even if Manuel Almunia was the busier of the two goalkeepers on show, before Speroni was finally granted a chance to excel more regularly in the top flight. It was Pulis who oversaw safety last term, his No1 praising the \xe2\x80\x9corganisation\xe2\x80\x9d instilled in a squad who made history by surviving a Premier League campaign for the first time since the elite were revamped. The team have progressed again under Pardew this year, with Speroni now established as the latest in a succession of Palace goalkeepers who have spanned the generations: he now sits alongside John Jackson, John Burridge and Nigel Martyn.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat people even put my name anywhere close to those guys, for me, is just unreal,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve been such heroes for this club, real legends. It\xe2\x80\x99s an honour for me that people put me within that group. People talk to me about the way Palace fans feel about me, and I see it when I meet them around the ground or in the street, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see myself as that person. Players move around all the time in the modern game and when I first signed I never thought I\xe2\x80\x99d be here for 11 years. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve never felt the need or a reason to leave.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Fulham tried once and Sunderland and West Brom were poised last summer before his latest one-year extension kicked in, but he has put down roots in the area. His son, Thiago, is six and would be torn should England ever confront Argentina on the football pitch, while his daughter, Isabella, is seven months old.</p> <p>All the money raised at Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s game will go to charity, from Marie Curie to local community projects \xe2\x80\x9cstruggling without the funds\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been blessed through my career in many ways,\xe2\x80\x9d adds Speroni. \xe2\x80\x9cI want this to be a celebration of my time at the club; a memory the fans can take home and one I will cherish forever.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Speroni\xe2\x80\x99s managers at Crystal Palace (11): Iain Dowie; Peter Taylor; Neil Warnock (1); Paul Hart (interim); George Burley; Dougie Freedman; Lennie Lawrence (caretaker); Ian Holloway; Keith Millen (caretaker, 1); Tony Pulis; Millen (caretaker, 2); Warnock (2); Millen (caretaker, 3); Alan Pardew.</p>     Juli\xc3\xa1n Speroni\xe2\x80\x99s fantasy XI.
