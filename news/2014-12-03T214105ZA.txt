b'Arsenal v Southampton: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened | Jacob Steinberg'


b'<p>Ronald Koeman looks crushed, standing on the touchline, unable to take it in. You have to feel for Southampton. They gave as good as they got for long periods and were desperately unlucky first to lose Dusan Tadic and Jack Cork after they were on the receiving end of poor challenges and then when Toby Alderweireld injured his hamstring, leaving Southampton with 10 men. That opened it up for Arsenal and Alexis Sanchez pounced, meaning it\xe2\x80\x99s a second successive defeat for Southampton, who stay third. Arsenal go sixth, a point behind West Ham and two behind Manchester United. Thanks for reading. Night.</p>'
