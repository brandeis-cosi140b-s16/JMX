b'Louis van Gaal warns Manchester United players of \xe2\x80\x98rough\xe2\x80\x99 summer ahead of clearout'


b'<p>Louis van Gaal has warned he will be ruthless this summer when it comes to offloading players, saying it will be rough for those no longer required. The Manchester United manager also singled out David de Gea as impressing most this season, despite the goalkeeper appearing set to leave for Real Madrid, and the Spaniard was duly crowned the Players and Fans player of the year at the award ceremony on Tuesday night. Juan Mata was awarded the goal of the season prize.</p> <p>After Van Gaal presented De Gea with the fans\xe2\x80\x99 Player of the Year award, at the club\xe2\x80\x99s annual presentation evening, the Dutchman gave an impassioned speech during which he insisted United were \xe2\x80\x9cvery close\xe2\x80\x9d to Chelsea despite United being 15 points behind the champions with a match left. In a bizarre moment Van Gaal left the stage and returned moments later to thank a lady saxophone player.</p> <p>While the Dutchman said there could be many incomings, Robin van Persie, Radamel Falcao, \xc3\x81ngel Di Mar\xc3\xada, Rafael da Silva and Anders Lindegaard are among those who may depart while Adnan Januzaj could be loaned out. \xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be a rough summer for some of the players but I think a club like Manchester United has to be like that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>Van Gaal expects it to be a busy close season in the transfer market. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course it\xe2\x80\x99s always like that. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you have to keep the whole selection \xe2\x80\x93 when you purchase others players you get another stimulus also,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to how competition should increase overall quality within the squad.</p>  <p> Related: Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s Chris Smalling gives Hull City that sinking feeling </p>   <p>Van Gaal pointed to De Gea\xe2\x80\x99s progress when asked who has made the greatest impact in his first season as manager. \xe2\x80\x9cI think \xe2\x80\x93 he\xe2\x80\x99s enormous popular with the fans \xe2\x80\x93 David de Gea. In the beginning of the season as a manager I observed him, I analysed him and then I see his progress in the season \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic development from him. As a manager you look from that perspective. That\xe2\x80\x99s why David de Gea has impressed me the most because of this development.</p> <p>it will be tough to challenge Chelsea for the title next season. \xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be difficult. It is not easy in the Premier League. You can lose from every opponent. But I have confidence in the players and myself and the organisation.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Dutchman won the Champions League with Ajax in 1995 and took Bayern Munich to the 2010 final. With Van Gaal having guided the club back into the competition \xe2\x80\x93 as a minimum they will be in August\xe2\x80\x99s play-off round to enter the group stage \xe2\x80\x93 he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI have a very good record in the Champions League and I hope I can show this.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Gareth Southgate risks clash with clubs on Harry Kane and Luke Shaw </p>   <p>At the prospect of returning to the European Cup after only a single season\xe2\x80\x99s absence, Wayne Rooney said: \xe2\x80\x9cOur main objective was to get back into the Champions League and we\xe2\x80\x99ve done that. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got the quality to push on next season and I believe we can go on and win silverware. It was very important.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The captain and former Everton player aimed a dig at Liverpool. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you look at Liverpool what happened to them they were without it for years \xe2\x80\x93 which was no shame,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>Van Gaal offered a message to fans. \xe2\x80\x9cI can promise I can do my utmost best, that we shall fight to the end and more we cannot do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that we make the right decisions when you purchase players and when players are leaving the club \xe2\x80\x93 it is a natural process \xe2\x80\x93 and that the fans are not forgetting that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
