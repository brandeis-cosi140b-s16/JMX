b'Marcos Rojo back in Manchester United training after shoulder injury'


b'<p>Marcos Rojo has handed Manchester United a boost after returning to training following the dislocation of a shoulder in the derby defeat to Manchester City earlier this month.</p> <p>With Louis van Gaal preparing United for Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s visit of Hull City the game may come too soon for Rojo as the manager has previously stated players have to train for up to two weeks before being considered.</p> <p>After Hull, United face Stoke City on Tuesday and Southampton the following week so Rojo should come into contention for these matches if he is not deemed match fit for the Tigers game.</p> <p>It was initially feared Rojo could be out for as long as six weeks following the injury on 2 November, but the Argentinian has recovered quickly at a time when United are suffering from a long casualty list.</p> <p>Ander Herrera, the \xc2\xa328m summer signing, is facing a fight to reclaim a starting berth after being demoted to the reserves this week. The Spanish midfielder began the season in Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s first XI but lost his place following indifferent form and injury, having suffered a fractured rib.</p> <p>After the injury the 25-year-old was selected for the 2-2 draw at West Bromwich Albion \xe2\x80\x93 playing in a corset \xe2\x80\x93 but he has not featured since, with Fellaini scoring a fine equaliser at the Hawthorns and continuing to impress subsequently.</p> <p>The Belgian has started all of United\xe2\x80\x99s four games since, including meetings with Chelsea and Manchester City, while Herrera played for United\xe2\x80\x99s Under-21s this week, scoring in the 5-0 win over Blackburn Rovers in a Lancashire Senior Cup tie.</p> <p>Herrera has so far struggled with the pace of the Premier League and to be an influence in matches since joining from Athletic Bilbao.</p> <p>Jonny Evans, who also played against Rovers after returning from a broken foot, said: \xe2\x80\x9cI think the manager will have to assess that [a first-team recall] and also the fitness coaches. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been training for a week or two now but it\xe2\x80\x99s taking me time to get my fitness up as I\xe2\x80\x99ve been out for so long.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
