b'Sunderland 1-4 Manchester City | Premier League match report'


b'<p>It was the sort of night which mocked suggestions that this season\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League is a one-horse race and poured scorn on the notion that Manuel Pellegrini might be under some sort of pressure at the Etihad Stadium.</p> <p>With Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero at his ruthless best and Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 further deconstructing theories that he could be a fading force, Manchester City were irresistible.</p> <p>At times their football, frequently fast and one-touch, was so mesmerising they threatened to pass Gus Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s team off the pitch but the worrying thing for future opponents is that Sunderland scored first and were far from meek.</p> <p>Chelsea may hold a six-point lead at the top of the table but, on this utterly compelling evidence, Jose Mourinho has absolutely no cause for complacency. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t be champions in December,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pellegrini. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got six months more to try to be champions again but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will be just two teams fighting for the title, there\xe2\x80\x99ll be three or four. Manchester United have won their last four games and Arsenal are coming again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>City, though, hold an ace card in Ag\xc3\xbcero, who has scored 19 goals in 20 appearances this term. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there\xe2\x80\x99s a better striker in Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d the manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn his last few games I think he\xe2\x80\x99s shown he\xe2\x80\x99s one of the best five players in the world. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just that he\xe2\x80\x99s scoring, he\xe2\x80\x99s playing very well generally. And we\xe2\x80\x99re returning to our best form, there\xe2\x80\x99s trust in the team, it\xe2\x80\x99s different now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Poyet \xe2\x80\x93 still to name the same starting XI in successive games this season \xe2\x80\x93 changed the formula which secured a fine point against Chelsea last Saturday. Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s manager aimed to confuse City by shaking things up. Where his team had been content to sit deep against Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s players, they attempted to impose themselves, holding a high defensive line as, initially at least, they endeavoured to press Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s side.</p> <p>If this strategy produced mixed results, the switching of Connor Wickham from the left to right flank and the replacement of the injured Adam Johnson with Will Buckley briefly, deceptively, seemed to ruffle the visiting defence.</p> <p>And after Pablo Zabaleta blocked a shot from his former team-mate Jack Rodwell following Buckley\xe2\x80\x99s deceiving early cross, Wickham opened the scoring. Sebastian Larsson\xe2\x80\x99s reverse pass created the goal, which was tinged with fortune as Wickham benefited from the ball ricocheting back on to him after an attempted tackle. The ball flicked off the striker and arced impressively over Joe Hart like the cleverest chip.</p> <p>Revenge was not long in coming. Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s players, like Sunderland, were keen to press high up the pitch and they were beginning to prove considerably better at it. So much so that Ag\xc3\xbcero\xe2\x80\x99s equaliser had a certain air of inevitability. Or at least it did if you ignored the statistics. With City having surrendered 1-0 on each of their previous four visits to Sunderland, Ag\xc3\xbcero\xe2\x80\x99s was their first goal here since 2010.</p> <p>Connecting with Jes\xc3\xbas Navas\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful cross, Ag\xc3\xbcero nutmegged Sebasti\xc3\xa1n Coates before lashing an unstoppable right-foot shot beyond his one-time team-mate Costel Pantilimon from the edge of the area. Perhaps anxious to emphasise he can also create, he then set up Stevan Jovetic for his side\xe2\x80\x99s second.</p> <p>The moment when Jovetic took aim and whipped the ball through Pantilimon\xe2\x80\x99s legs came at the end of a fabulous move featuring around 30 passes. Things reached a conclusion when Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 teased Sunderland by retaining possession before picking out Ag\xc3\xbcero with his back to goal and the Argentinian lifted a perfectly cushioned flick into Jovetic\xe2\x80\x99s path.</p> <p>With Tour\xc3\xa9 taking increasing command of central midfield, where he made life awkward for Lee Cattermole, Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s players thoroughly deserved their lead. As a December chill which threatened to leave car windscreens in need of de-icing began to bite, Ag\xc3\xbcero, Tour\xc3\xa9 and Co continued enjoying themselves. Yet good as City were, sporadic cameos indicated why Dedryck Boyata and Mart\xc3\xadn Demichelis are not Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s first-choice central defensive combination and Fernandinho was forced to clear Rodwell\xe2\x80\x99s header off the line following Larsson\xe2\x80\x99s excellent corner.</p> <p>Not that such concerns mattered when Zabaleta struck. Reminding everyone that he is not all about defensive play, the right-back played a deft one-two with Samir Nasri before confounding Pantilimon with an audacious lob directed into the far corner.</p> <p>By now Boyata\xe2\x80\x99s habit of conceding unnecessarily clumsy fouls barely registered, and it became virtually irrelevant when Ag\xc3\xbcero scored his second. Meeting James Milner\xe2\x80\x99s cross, he ghosted in front of Santiago Vergini before flicking a shot beyond poor Pantilimon via the inside of a post. \xe2\x80\x9cFinally,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pellegrini, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99ve won at Sunderland.\xe2\x80\x9d Poyet, although the best part of two decades younger, looked considerably more tired afterwards. \xe2\x80\x9cCity were better than us in every aspect,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we paid the price.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
