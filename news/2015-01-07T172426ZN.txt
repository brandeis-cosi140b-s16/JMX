b'Newcastle to stick with John Carver while manager hunt continues'


b'<p>Newcastle United will take their time over appointing a manager and John Carver may remain in caretaker charge for not only Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Chelsea but also the home game against Southampton the following week.</p> <p>Although Newcastle remain interested in R\xc3\xa9mi Garde and are understood to have made contact with the former Lyon manager and Arsenal defensive midfielder, other candidates are being considered.</p> <p>It seems certain Alan Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s successor will be from overseas after Steve McClaren pledged his loyalty to Derby County. Newcastle regarded the former England and Middlesbrough manager as a strong contender but McClaren\xe2\x80\x99s comments seem to have ruled out any possibility of his re-locating to Tyneside.</p> <p>The BBC pundit and former Newcastle caretaker-manager Alan Shearer has hinted that a \xe2\x80\x9csmall part\xe2\x80\x9d of him wonders whether Mike Ashley, the club\xe2\x80\x99s owner, had encouraged Pardew to depart for Crystal Palace after telling him he would shortly be putting up the \xe2\x80\x9csold\xe2\x80\x9d signs at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park.</p> <p>Although this theory is contradicted by emphatic denials from the club that Ashley, who recently said he would not consider selling until the summer of 2016 at the earliest, is preparing for a sale, Shearer does not seem entirely convinced.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what [Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s intentions for the club are] because he never tells us anything,\xe2\x80\x9d he said during a BBC interview. \xe2\x80\x9cHe doesn\xe2\x80\x99t speak to anyone but there\xe2\x80\x99s a small part of me that thinks he might have given Alan Pardew a nod.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Quite apart from Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s insistence that Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s statement about remaining in control for at least 18 months remains accurate, offloading a football clubs is \xe2\x80\x93 as Aston Villa\xe2\x80\x99s owner, Randy Lerner, has discovered \xe2\x80\x93 difficult.</p> <p>There are other plausible explanations behind Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s departure. \xe2\x80\x9cIt did make me laugh when I heard people saying that Alan wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t leave Newcastle to go to Crystal Palace,\xe2\x80\x9d Shearer said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a million reasons why Alan would leave Newcastle to go to Crystal Palace: he\xe2\x80\x99d be on a better salary at a club where the fans would want him, he would buy and sell the players he wanted. There\xe2\x80\x99s three very good reasons to start with. That\xe2\x80\x99s where Newcastle are as a club, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid. Not good news but we\xe2\x80\x99re used to that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
