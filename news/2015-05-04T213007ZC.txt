b'<p>Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas rates Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho as the best manager for whom he has played and claims the Portuguese boasts an \xe2\x80\x9cedge\xe2\x80\x9d that sets him apart from others such as Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger and Pep Guardiola.</p> <p>The Chelsea midfielder celebrated his first Premier League title this weekend to cap a hugely successful first campaign back in English football after a three-year spell with Barcelona, initially under Guardiola. F\xc3\xa0bregas\xe2\x80\x99s only previous major honour in this country had been the 2005 FA Cup with Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s Arsenal. The \xc2\xa328m signing is confident the league trophy, which will be celebrated with a victory parade 24 hours after Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s final game of the season, will prove the first of many in a new era at the London club.</p>  <p> Related: John Terry feared he might not win Premier League title again </p>   <p>F\xc3\xa0bregas is, a strong candidate to become the team\xe2\x80\x99s vice-captain if, as expected, Petr Cech moves on this summer, praised the Mourinho effect as integral to this season\xe2\x80\x99s success at Stamford Bridge. \xe2\x80\x9cHe just loves winning,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not saying other managers I have played under don\xe2\x80\x99t but he has some edge that goes above anyone else I have ever been with. The mentality shows in every single training session, every game. I now understand why he has won what he has in his career.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe knows how to manage a team, knows how to get the best out of you, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what you want from a manager 100%. A manager who can motivate a player every three days when you play 60 games in a season \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s not easy, trust me. Everyone thinks we have a big squad but we don\xe2\x80\x99t. We have maybe 22 players and some of those are from the academy and under-21s. So it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy. He actually is doing a fantastic job. He\xe2\x80\x99s the best manager and has to get results but always manages to do that with any squad he\xe2\x80\x99s coached. He manages to make his team champions and that\xe2\x80\x99s the sign of a real winner.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cObviously you need someone behind it all which is the manager who, every single day, makes sure you are top of your game. Even, I remember when we went to Shrewsbury or when Bolton came to Stamford Bridge in the Capital One Cup. There\xe2\x80\x99s no game where he allows complacency to creep in and that helps: when you know if you don\xe2\x80\x99t perform in training, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t perform in a game where everyone thinks it is going to be easy, you don\xe2\x80\x99t play. Definitely, that helps.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Spain international gave the team-talk in the dressing room on Sunday before the victory over Crystal Palace which secured Chelsea their first title in five years, an indication of the esteem in which he is held within the squad. Cech, who has been reduced to Thibaut Courtois\xe2\x80\x99 understudy this season, is expected to leave after 11 years at the club \xe2\x80\x93 there is interest from Arsenal, Internazionale and Paris Saint-Germain \xe2\x80\x93 meaning an understudy to John Terry will be appointed this summer. F\xc3\xa0bregas is effectively competing with Gary Cahill for the role given Didier Drogba will also be out of contract.</p>  <p> Related: Chelsea are Premier League champions again \xe2\x80\x93 who can stop them next season? </p>   <p>Chelsea expect to make some additions this summer and interest has been registered with Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid for F\xc3\xa0bregas\xe2\x80\x99s compatriot Koke. The underused left-back Filipe Lu\xc3\xads could return to his former club as part of any deal for the attacking midfielder. Yet F\xc3\xa0bregas is convinced the current team can continue to progress.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHopefully it will be the start of a new era,\xe2\x80\x9d said F\xc3\xa0bregas, who turned 28 on Monday. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a new team even if we have the likes of John, Didier, Petr, [Branislav]Ivanovic and Mikel [John Obi] who have been a long time, but the new players will now feel this winning mentality which can go on for a long time.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI have always said, since the beginning of the season, that it is a very young, talented team and that as well is one of the causes that made me sign for the club. Potentially this team can be one of the best in Europe. And the manager still makes me feel things that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel for a while: he allows me to play and gives me confidence. Winning this title is up there with getting 100 points with Bar\xc3\xa7a to win La Liga. I feel important and that\xe2\x80\x99s what you want as a player. You want to feel part of it and that\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m doing at Chelsea.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
