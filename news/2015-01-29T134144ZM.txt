b'<p>Mario Balotelli\xe2\x80\x99s agent has told the player to knuckle down and fight for a place in the Liverpool starting lineup while also admitting that bringing the forward back to Italy from Manchester City was one of the biggest mistakes of his career.</p> <p>Balotelli has had a difficult start to his time at Anfield but Mino Raiola, who also represents Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Paul Pogba among others, said that being at Liverpool was the best lesson the 24-year-old had had in his whole life and that he expects the player to see out his contract with the Premier League club.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLiverpool are different from other clubs, Raiola told La Gazzetta dello Sport in a wide-ranging interview. \xe2\x80\x9cThere, [because of Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy] they can\xe2\x80\x99t allow themselves 10 players who run and a superstar [who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t]. Mario is a player who changes a game for you in two or three moments, so they have to adapt to him and him to them.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI saw him on Monday and said: \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ve got a [long] contract and I\xe2\x80\x99m not taking you away. Either you leave Liverpool for \xe2\x82\xac60m or \xe2\x82\xac70m and I win the bet or you die there\xe2\x80\x99. It\xe2\x80\x99s the first time that I\xe2\x80\x99ve had such a conversation with a player. I saw that he was calm, changed, different with respect to at Milan. Very disappointed in himself too.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe is going through times he\xe2\x80\x99s never had before. Before everybody wanted him to do well. He had space. At Liverpool, no: either you do as we say or you stay out [of the team]. Then he was out injured for eight weeks. He lost rhythm.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Raiola added that Balotelli has also been affected by personal problems during his spell at Anfield and has been particularly troubled by not being able to see his daughter Pia as often as he would like.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFinally there\xe2\x80\x99s the story about his daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d Raiola said. \xe2\x80\x9cPia has changed him but Mario has also found a woman [the girl\xe2\x80\x99s mother] who won\xe2\x80\x99t give him peace. If he organises to go see her on this day at this place, like clockwork there\xe2\x80\x99s a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s letter saying the little one has a fever. And Mario suffers a lot from this.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe real Mario has the ability to be the best in the world but not the character. And this phase at Liverpool is the most important lesson he has had. He has a sensational physique. Ronaldo does too but to keep it he has to drink mineral water. Mario eats spaghetti, cotoletta, he drinks iced tea. Now he is applying himself well. His private life is more settled. And there\xe2\x80\x99s no sense in asking whether Liverpool is the right place: it\xe2\x80\x99s the only place.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The agent, who has worked with Balotelli for the past five years, added that the player seems much calmer at Liverpool than he was at his former club Milan, where he was being asked to be a leader on the pitch.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOf all the champions I have represented I have never met one who has been forced to go through the injustices Mario has gone through,\xe2\x80\x9d Raiola said. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople don\xe2\x80\x99t know him. The truth is that Mario is an insecure kid and in his insecurity perhaps he sometimes does silly things. I have always wanted to satisfy my players. With others I have gone with my own mind but with him no. \xe2\x80\x98I need my mum, my friends, Italy,\xe2\x80\x99 he said. Being a dad and wanting to make him happy I brought him back to Italy from City. It was one of the biggest mistakes of my career.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI should have said to him: \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re not going back to Italy. City are a great club. They\xe2\x80\x99ll never let you down. This is the football that counts [one of the best leagues in the world] and you want to leave it\xe2\x80\x99. I\xe2\x80\x99m convinced I was wrong for another reason too: Milan needed a leader. Give the ball to Mario, he scores and everyone is happy. But he is not a leader and it was wrong to ask him to be one. There are great players who aren\xe2\x80\x99t leaders, and other not-so-great players who are.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
