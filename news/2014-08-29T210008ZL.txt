b'Lee Cattermole can get into England team, says Gus Poyet'


b'<p>Gus Poyet believes Lee Cattermole can emulate his former Sunderland team-mate Jack Colback and earn a place in the England squad.</p> <p>Cattermole has improved radically under Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s management at the Stadium of Light and, although they are very different midfielders, many north-east football watchers are surprised that Newcastle United\xe2\x80\x99s Colback received a call up ahead of Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s enforcer.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLee needs to say: \xe2\x80\x98If I keep performing the way I have been, then sooner or later I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have a chance,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Poyet. \xe2\x80\x9c I think there\xe2\x80\x99s a big opportunity for English midfielders after the decisions of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard to retire from international football. If Jack Colback and Fabian Delph don\xe2\x80\x99t take their chance this time, maybe another player will come into consideration \xe2\x80\x93 and that could be Lee.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s up to Roy Hodgson but if I was the England manager I would definitely pick Lee because I like his character and the way he plays the game. If, like me, he was Uruguayan there is no doubt Lee would be picked for the national team, because we like that type of combative player.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Cattermole\xe2\x80\x99s discipline has tightened up appreciably in the past year but he still reminds Poyet of his old friend Dennis Wise. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s something of Dennis in him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the former Chelsea midfielder. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are similar characters, they play in the same position, they hate losing, they improve the team and, now again, they show their frustration.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWisey was important, he was a leader and he helped the others maintain concentration. You need players like that. Wisey was the main person at Chelsea, we all followed him and were led by him. Now we are a different team when Lee is on the pitch; maybe that will help him get in the England team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>There was a time when Cattermole served as a magnet to red and yellow cards but he rarely lunges in with quite such reckless abandon these days and, having adapted to Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s possession-based game, is proving a much better passer than many people believed.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLee finished 20 games last year without being sent off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poyet. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s enjoying his football and we lose the ball less now. We are defending less so he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to make so many tackles but, in any case, that side of his game has improved dramatically.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
