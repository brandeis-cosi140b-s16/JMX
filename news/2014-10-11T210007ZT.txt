b'The life and grime of Crystal Palace\xe2\x80\x99s rapping winger Yannick Bolasie'


b'<p>Yannick Bolasie sits in the autumn sunshine chatting over a burger and sweet potato fries. Alongside the Crystal Palace midfielder sits his long-time girlfriend, Kelsey, while their one-year-old son, Kaidy, toddles about, beaming and clutching a chip.</p> <p>There is something refreshingly unflashy about the scene, about Bolasie. Born in Lyon to Congolese parents, the family moved to north-west London when he was a baby. He still lives in the area now. A modest house, hoodies and jeans, and a career path that saw him forge his way from non-league, via a season in Malta, all the way to the Premier League.</p> <p>The 25-year-old says he learned some of his biggest life lessons being left on the shelf at Hillingdon Borough. One of those has been to stay grounded. Walking down the street now most would not recognise him as a Premier League footballer. He likes it that way. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to try to live like Eden Hazard, for example,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a totally different lifestyle. He\xe2\x80\x99s gonna have a bigger house, a bigger this \xe2\x80\xa6 You can get attracted too much to that side. And then you forget what you do best. Football.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>On an improved contract with Palace, Bolasie says he prefers to save money than spend it. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m still going to live off the same budget I had before. I\xe2\x80\x99m not spending anything extra. I just put it in the bank \xe2\x80\xa6 [whereas] a lot of people if they change salary they start doing different things and just get lost a little bit.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>This week Bolasie has been in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Ivory Coast. If ever life in the Premier League does begin to distort reality, these trips bring him back down to earth with a bump. Budget airlines to Kinshasa, \xe2\x80\x9cold school\xe2\x80\x9d equipment to prepare for matches; Bolasie and the Peterborough defender Gabriel Zakuani joke about their international trips on Twitter and Instagram. But Bolasie, whose cousin is the DRC international Lomana LuaLua, also softens when he speaks about the problems facing the country where some of his family live.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a different kind of experience. You see people struggling, it\xe2\x80\x99s humbling. We went to visit a girls\xe2\x80\x99 school. It was built because there were so many rape cases of young women, they decided to give them education so they\xe2\x80\x99re not exposed to those sort of things,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. He wants to take Kelsey and Kaidy out there to visit his family, but he recognises it is not an easy place to visit. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a population where there\xe2\x80\x99s no middle ground. You\xe2\x80\x99re either poor or you\xe2\x80\x99ve got money. There\xe2\x80\x99s no in between.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>If football is Bolasie\xe2\x80\x99s life, then music is his passion. Type Bolasie\xe2\x80\x99s name into YouTube and you are as likely to find clips of his \xe2\x80\x9cGrime battles\xe2\x80\x9d with the New York Red Bulls striker Bradley Wright-Phillips as you are foot age of the winger\xe2\x80\x99s dazzling runs. Bolasie grew up rhyming, he says, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom school days. It was either that or playing football in the playground\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI listen to [grime] before matches. In the car I\xe2\x80\x99ll be rapping, the missus gets annoyed with it,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, with a grin. \xe2\x80\x9cKaidy nods his head to it. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that right, Kaidy?\xe2\x80\x9d Kaidy grins adoringly, before working his way around the table and proudly offering up a half-chewed sweet potato fry. \xe2\x80\x9cRight now when I\xe2\x80\x99m doing [music] a lot of people are taking more notice, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve always been doing it. I guess the attention\xe2\x80\x99s just come with the Premier League.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Wright-Phillips and Bolasie met while playing for Plymouth in 2009 and became close friends, united in their love of MCing. They began messing about, leaving lyrics on each other\xe2\x80\x99s voicemail, crying with laughter. And it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t long before word got around. Their talent was picked up by the grime rapper and producer Jammer, who featured the friends ripping into each other on the recent DVD Lord of the Mics 6.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cJust \xe2\x80\x99cos you got Wright in your name, don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you\xe2\x80\x99re a Gunner,\xe2\x80\x9d spits Bolasie, before launching a scathing attack on Wright-Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 career. \xe2\x80\x9cMan will get left in the park like Ji-Sung \xe2\x80\xa6 Looking bare eager couldn\xe2\x80\x99t score goals in the Championship, that\xe2\x80\x99s why he went down to League One \xe2\x80\x93 Brentford didn\xe2\x80\x99t want him neither.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The words prompt howls of laughter from the MCs crowded around Bolasie, filmed at a recent BBC 1Xtra recording. Wright-Phillips is just as merciless in his riposte: \xe2\x80\x9cAbout MC battle, you was in a relegation battle \xe2\x80\xa6 you want beef? I\xe2\x80\x99ll be carving cattle.\xe2\x80\x9d He also knows Bolasie\xe2\x80\x99s sore points: \xe2\x80\x9cNo goals? I feel so sorry for you \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Bolasie nods. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to score goals,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, firmly. The winger went all of last season without scoring, and a recent goal against Everton was only his fourth in 79 league appearances for Palace. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone says that\xe2\x80\x99s the only part of my game that\xe2\x80\x99s missing. Before I was a pro I used to score goals for fun. I want to bring that back into my game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>With Bolasie, it is not just talk. He carries a notebook everywhere, in which he meticulously writes down everything he does in an effort to improve his game. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s got all my scores \xe2\x80\x93 how much hours I sleep, points for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, protein after training, refuelling.\xe2\x80\x9d How many points for a burger? \xe2\x80\x9cEr \xe2\x80\xa6 nah, I\xc2\xa0wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get any points for that,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there\xe2\x80\x99s a points tally at the end of the week. You can trace it back. If you play good you can see where it\xe2\x80\x99s come from.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Bolasie says the programme, attributed to his trainer Rayan Wilson, has changed his body: from a beanpole to \xe2\x80\x9ca beast\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>But scoring goals is not just about physique. The Palace fans\xe2\x80\x99 favourite tells of a psychological battle to overcome his fear of the net. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the thought process, nothing else,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, quietly. \xe2\x80\x9cLast season I started panicking for no reason. You drain yourself out.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It was Tony Pulis, the then Palace manager, who saved him. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said: \xe2\x80\x98Let me be the worrier.\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of time for Tony Pulis.\xe2\x80\x9d Was Bolasie sad when he left? \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, a little bit. He\xe2\x80\x99s the one that gave me a lot of confidence. He come in and told me to believe in myself. He kept telling me I\xe2\x80\x99m a \xe2\x80\x98top, top player\xe2\x80\x99. Those exact words. And I\xe2\x80\x99d laugh at it. I\xe2\x80\x99d go: \xe2\x80\x98Ha ha\xe2\x80\x99. But he said: \xe2\x80\x98No, I\xe2\x80\x99m being serious.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Had other managers ever spoken that way to him? \xe2\x80\x9cNo. Not the way he did with me.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI remember we played against Arsenal [last season] I beat [Nacho] Monreal with so much ease, [Mikel] Arteta was coming along and then I decided to put in a cross. The gaffer came in after and said: \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re better than that. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got much more pace and strength than Arteta. Knock it past him and get it in the box.\xe2\x80\x99 From then I knew. Whatever he said to me was the truth. And Neil [Warnock]\xe2\x80\x99s given me the same sort of confidence. Not to the same extent \xe2\x80\x93 with [Pulis] it was literally every single game he\xe2\x80\x99d have a chat. But I think that brought the best out of me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>If Pulis gave Bolasie a supportive ear, the return of Wilfried Zaha has provided the competitive edge. The pair get on well but they are hungry to outdo each other on the pitch. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s competitive all round, even in training. [I say] \xe2\x80\x98Me and you! Competition! Let\xe2\x80\x99s go!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d says Bolasie, gesticulating wildly. \xe2\x80\x9cWe played each other five-a-side and I\xe2\x80\x99m saying: \xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t go past me.\xe2\x80\x99 He\xe2\x80\x99s saying: \xe2\x80\x98Two years ago I gave you a nutmeg \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99m saying: \xe2\x80\x98Leave that stuff. When you come against me, just pass it off, because you\xe2\x80\x99re not getting past me.\xe2\x80\x99 It just kicks off from there. It\xe2\x80\x99s funny.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Listening to Bolasie talk is fascinating. One minute he is a young guy, playfully cussing his friends, the next obsessively counting rest hours, or engaging in earnest discussion about his completed dribbles stats versus Premier League possession percentages (he made last season\xe2\x80\x99s top five).</p> <p>His agent, John Sorzano, says he is the smartest footballer he has ever worked with, a player who goes into financial meetings equipped with an understanding of spreadsheets, expenditure, tax and insurance. At home, says Kelsey, who is studying to be a bookkeeper, he is compulsive about housework. \xe2\x80\x9cThe best Hooverer ever\xe2\x80\x9d, and constantly tidying up after his young son.</p> <p>Bolasie smiles. A stickler for order and process, it cannot have been easy to go through four managers in two years at Palace, each time adapting to a different style of play.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone has their own philosophy,\xe2\x80\x9d he explains. \xe2\x80\x9cIan Holloway played wingers higher up and then wanted us to come back and receive the ball; Dougie\xc2\xa0Freedman didn\xe2\x80\x99t want us to come back too much because he wanted us to attack; Tony Pulis made the team sit back so it was literally you against the full-back.\xe2\x80\x9d And Warnock? \xe2\x80\x9cHe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t brought in his full philosophy yet because he wants to change things slowly. Which is good.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>How have the team pulled off a promotion and a second season in the Premier League with all that going on? \xe2\x80\x9cThe spirit in the dressing room,\xe2\x80\x9d Bolasie says.</p> <p>Kaidy starts to cry. His dad gives him a cuddle. Even when you finally reach the top, Bolasie acknowledges, football is not easy. Becoming a parent, though, has brought perspective.</p> <p>He will need it. Palace will have to work hard to maintain their status beyond this second season. Their campaign continues at Chelsea on Saturday, where Bolasie will be keen to add to the winning goal he scored at Goodison Park. If he does not, he can expect another voicemail from Bradley Wright-Phillips.</p>'
