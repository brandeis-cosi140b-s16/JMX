b'Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa3107m summer signings: how they have fared'


b'ADAM LALLANA <p>\xc2\xa325m from Southampton 984mins</p> <p>Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s biggest signing was unable to hit the ground running due to injury and has performed in fits and starts since, scoring against West Brom and Leicester.</p> DEJAN LOVREN <p>\xc2\xa320m from Southampton 1,533mins</p> <p>Centre-back Lovren has not looked comfortable since arriving at Anfield and was dropped for four games following last month\xe2\x80\x99s defeat at Crystal Palace.</p> LAZAR MARKOVIC <p>\xc2\xa319.8m from Benfica 559mins</p> <p>At 20 and having played in weaker leagues, Markovic needs patience but there have been few glimmers and his red card against Basel was perhaps costly.</p> MARIO BALOTELLI <p>\xc2\xa316m from Milan 967mins</p> <p>Yet to score in the Premier League and plainly not Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 first choice in the last transfer window, Balotelli\xe2\x80\x99s major contribution has been to ignite a debate on the merits of shirt-swapping.</p> ALBERTO MORENO <p>\xc2\xa312m from Sevilla 1,268mins</p> <p>Moreno has looked the most promising summer signing, although he has not been error-free. He, too, spent time out of the side after a tough start to November.</p> EMRE CAN <p>\xc2\xa39.75m from Bayer Leverkusen 369mins</p> <p>Injury meant that Can did not start a game until 19 October. There have been promising signs since and a goal against Chelsea, while deflected, augured well.</p> RICKIE LAMBERT <p>\xc2\xa34m from Southampton 832mins</p> <p>Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s dream move seemed to have soured when he had to wait until October for a league start, but goals against Crystal Palace and Ludogorets gave hope that there may yet be a happy ending.</p>'
