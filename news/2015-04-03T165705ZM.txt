b'Manchester United v Aston Villa: match preview'


b'<p>Everything is suddenly rosy at Manchester United after the consecutive victories over Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool mean Louis van Gaal can look upwards towards the leaders, Chelsea, as is his stated wish. Yet as the final stretch of the \xe2\x80\x9crat race\xe2\x80\x9d to qualify for the Champions League is entered Aston Villa arrive at Old Trafford having drawn 1-1 in the reverse fixture, despite having only 10 men for the final 25 minutes due to Gabriel Agbonlahor\xe2\x80\x99s red card in that December game. This resilience means United may have a difficult time maintaining momentum though, really, given their \xc2\xa3150m-plus summer transfer spend there should be only one victor.
