b'Five ways for the Premier League to use its new \xc2\xa35bn deal for good | Owen Gibson'


b'1) Cut ticket prices <p>As the amount raised from those who actually fill grounds on a weekly basis becomes less and less important to the bottom line of the biggest clubs, surely even the most myopic can see there is merit in a collective, across-the-board price cut in response to the latest bounteous TV deal. Even in the most cynical PR terms it would draw the sting of a lot of the criticism and ill-focused but deeply felt discomfort about where modern football is heading.</p> <p>Away fans spend the most and suffer the most upheaval to feed their addiction (soon to increase as a result of the introduction of Friday night matches and a rise in the number shunted around the calendar for live TV from 154 to 168). So it would seem sensible to start with them. According to the Football Supporters\xe2\x80\x99 Federation, top slicing 3% from the extra income raised by the new live domestic TV rights deal (\xc2\xa363m) would be enough to subsidise a \xc2\xa320 cap on away ticket prices. And given that away fans are key components in generating the helter-skelter atmosphere that feeds ever-spiralling rights fees from Boston to Bangalore that will boost the overall take to around \xc2\xa38.5bn, there are sound long-term business reasons too. The Premier League argues clubs are loth to give up their autonomy on ticket pricing. Yet the existing, modest Away Fans Fund has already set a precedent for centrally funded initiatives.</p> <p>Reducing the cost to away fans should be a given and just the start. The chief executive, Richard Scudamore, points out stadiums are fuller than ever before despite percentage ticket inflation typically running to almost four figures in the Premier League era. But the latest windfall should prompt urgent thought about how best to nurture the next generation: rolling out Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s teenage area to all clubs or extending concessionary prices to the age of 21 might be good places to start. Safe standing should be pushed up the agenda at speed \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps with a centralised fund to pay for the conversion of existing seated areas \xe2\x80\x93 in an attempt to allow groups of friends to mass together at affordable prices.</p>           Owen Gibson answers the key questions in the record \xc2\xa35.1bn TV rights deal.    2) Invest in grassroots facilities <p>The endless debate about where grassroots funding should come from has been going for more than two decades. This is the point at which it should stop. Scudamore is right that it is not for the Premier League alone to fund facilities, get the country moving and solve the obesity crisis. But putting \xc2\xa312m a year into the Football Foundation (a figure that stood at \xc2\xa320m in 2000) is simply not good enough.</p> <p>The figure should be index linked to increases in TV income. If that had been the case since 2000, it would now stand at around \xc2\xa3100m. But why stop there? Why not turbocharge the Football Foundation model? If new facilities in local communities can be linked to nearby clubs, the power of their branding and the possibility of expanding their community coaching schemes, all the better.</p> <p>In the meantime the FA\xe2\x80\x99s well thought through plan for 3G football hubs in 30 cities up and down the country by the end of the decade has been costed at \xc2\xa3150m. The chairman, Greg Dyke, has told staff to find \xc2\xa330m by taking a long overdue look at the FA\xe2\x80\x99s own priorities; the government (which should not be let off the hook here) has said it will contribute \xc2\xa350m. Local authorities, despite deep cuts that have fallen disproportionately on discretionary leisure spend, might reasonably be expected to stump up at least \xc2\xa320m. That leaves \xc2\xa350m to find \xe2\x80\x93 a rounding error in the new TV deal. While we\xe2\x80\x99re at it, perhaps it is also time to look again at the rule that mandates a 50-50 split for the FA\xe2\x80\x99s investment between the professional game and the grassroots one. Scudamore is right to say the priority for the Premier League is continuing to put on the show that draws viewers and big bucks. But with income at these levels it does not have to be an either/or. It can afford to do the right thing as well as the profitable thing.</p>     Graphic: The Guardian Photograph: The Guardian    3) Build better community links <p>To bash the Premier League as a rapacious money-making machine is unfair. Over recent years there has been growing understanding that it must do more than simply inflate the pay packets of players and agents. The question is: could it do more? The answer is yes. It has invested millions over the past three years into projects like lauded inner city community scheme Kickz and Premier League 4 Sport, which uses the allure of football to encourage kids to play other sports. It has now branched out into using coaches from its clubs to provide PE lessons in primary schools.</p> <p>Seeing these projects up close, there is no denying they can be powerful. Others fall closer to the category of PR fig leaves. But their very existence is an acknowledgment that the broadcasting billions could and should be doing more. At Parliamentary receptions and lobbying events, you will hear football\xe2\x80\x99s power brokers talk up the sport\xe2\x80\x99s ability to reach out to communities, cut crime and inspire learning. How much better if these schemes were better resourced by a unit devoted to social aims and co-ordinating clubs to link better with the communities in which they were once embedded.</p> <p>It would be better for everyone \xe2\x80\x93 for fans, for clubs, for the communities they serve and for the broadcasters pouring billions into their pockets \xe2\x80\x93 if the huge allure that currently attracts ever larger commercial deals could also power so-called community projects on a more ambitious scale. Clubs are more than just businesses and fans more than mere consumers but even the corporate world recognises the value of significant CSR investment.</p> 4) Greater redistribution to Football League and the non-league <p>Ever since the Premier League broke away in 1992 in the face of a weak and dithering FA, the debate has raged about how much it should redistribute to the rest of the pyramid.</p> <p>Every three years it habituallythe Premier Leagueit battled the Football League over parachute payments and so-called \xe2\x80\x9csolidarity payments\xe2\x80\x9d. While the former were index linked to broadcasting income, the latter were not, so the gulf between the haves and have-nots grew ever wider.</p> <p>The Premier League has quietly renegotiated its deal with the Football League to avoid that row in future. From 2016-17 Championship clubs will receive 30% of the value of a \xe2\x80\x9cyear three\xe2\x80\x9d parachute payment (currently \xc2\xa310m), while League One clubs will receive 4.5% of the value and League Two clubs will receive 3%.</p> <p>If that ratio was currently in place, Championship clubs would receive \xc2\xa33m each rather than the \xc2\xa32.3m they currently get. The Premier League points out that as TV income grows, so will the amount paid to the Football League. But as rights income goes up it is inevitable that money will become stretched and a chasm will open between the Championship and League One.</p> <p>Clubs coming down from the gilded elite will be cushioned by generous parachute payments but further down the league the riches slow to a trickle. A second increase of 70% in domestic live rights income can\xe2\x80\x99t help but increase the over-riding impression that the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s global product long ago left the moorings of the rest of the pyramid.</p> <p>The new arrangement is an advance in that it negates the need for a bruising row every three years, in which other issues were often thrown in to the pot. But it sets in stone a mechanism that cannot be challenged.</p> 5) Introduce the new living wage <p>As Scudamore toured radio studios to discuss the new bumper \xc2\xa35.1bn rights deal, he seemed baffled to be asked about an ongoing campaign to ensure football club employees are paid the living wage. Channelling the episode of the comedy series Father Ted in which the eponymous priest endlessly insists \xe2\x80\x9cthat would be an ecumenical matter\xe2\x80\x9d, he first said it was a topic for the clubs, then that it was a matter for politicians.</p> <p>Muttering that the Premier League was \xe2\x80\x9cnot a charity\xe2\x80\x9d, Scudamore queried whether cinema cleaners or bar staff at music venues earned the living wage while stars collected millions. He missed the point. Scudamore was playing his usual trick of speaking to his constituency \xe2\x80\x93 the 20 clubs \xe2\x80\x93 rather than the wider public but risked sounding like a banker defending bonuses.</p> <p>The reason the campaign has become totemic is because it exposes the underlying attitude of English football to the light. It also speaks to a business model that pays fortunes to compete for talent on the pitch but too often cuts corners elsewhere, leaving the game modern and shiny on the outside but lacking talent and resource on the inside. It is the same underlying ethos that does not properly remunerate or value youth coaches or provide proper career paths for many. Of the 20 Premier League clubs, only Chelsea has promised to pay its contracted staff the living wage. In a game now awash with more money than it can handle it would be the first, and simplest, step to showing it appreciates that there is a world beyond its walls.</p>'
