b'Swansea City v Arsenal: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0as it happened | Daniel Harris'


b'<p>As for Arsenal, forgetting the defensive issues that are too painful even to contemplate, they\xe2\x80\x99re still no nearer finding the balance going forward. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain did well, but the rest only flickered; there were moments of quality, but those are unavoidable with the players that they have on the pitch - missing was dominance of any kind. </p> <p>Anyway, thanks all for your company and comments. Bye. </p>'
