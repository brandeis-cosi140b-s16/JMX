b'<p>It was a performance that did nothing for Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s dubious claim that Arsenal are well-stocked in the striker department and under no pressure to bring in a replacement for the injured Olivier Giroud before the transfer window shutters come down. Yaya Sanogo was given the job of leading the line but was withdrawn 13 minutes from time, still without a goal in 17 Arsenal appearances and, on this evidence, well short of being the centre-forward his club need.</p> <p>With the game deep into time added on the Arsenal supporters offered their own damning judgment on what they had witnessed on an afternoon when Leicester played with tremendous energy and thoroughly deserved a point. \xe2\x80\x9cSign a fucking striker\xe2\x80\x9d reverberated from the travelling fans.</p> <p>Bathed in sunshine, the mood of the Arsenal faithful was darkened by the absence of a cutting edge as Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s side registered 24 attempts at goal \xe2\x80\x93 more than in any game last season \xe2\x80\x93 but only six were on target.</p> <p>Wenger introduced Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Lukas Podolski \xe2\x80\x93 one of the other forwards at his service \xe2\x80\x93 late on but his team had run out of ideas by that stage and the Arsenal manager was honest enough to admit to being genuinely concerned that Leicester, who looked dangerous on the counter-attack, may go on and pinch a winner. Jamie Vardy nearly did with just seven minutes remaining, when the Leicester substitute broke free only to be denied by a full-stretch save from Wojciech Szczesny.</p> <p>Asked about what the Arsenal fans were singing, Wenger replied: \xe2\x80\x9cEvery solution every time you don\xe2\x80\x99t win a game is to buy somebody anyway. We try our best and you have to trust us to find the best possible solution, but as well not to every time you don\xe2\x80\x99t win think that it\xe2\x80\x99s a miracle-man who wins you a game. Why did Man City not win yesterday against Stoke? They have plenty of strikers.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>There was, however, no escaping the fact that Sanogo looked like a man short of confidence and nowhere near ready to be the frontline striker for a club of Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s stature.</p> <p>Sanogo had a less-than-convincing hand in the opener, when Kasper Schmeichel deflected the forward\xe2\x80\x99s poor attempt to lob him into the path of Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez, who swept home his first Premier League goal. It was symptomatic of Sanogo\xe2\x80\x99s contribution. A one-on-one chance in the second half, after a fine run from Nacho Monreal on the Arsenal left, was also passed up.</p> <p>Wenger admitted Sanogo\xe2\x80\x99s goal drought is now an issue. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have been 21 and you start playing football and if you play up front and you don\xe2\x80\x99t score it\xe2\x80\x99s very quickly a problem,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think that problem will last very long. But at the moment, yes, when you have a chance to play for Arsenal as a centre-forward and you don\xe2\x80\x99t score, it\xe2\x80\x99s a problem for you.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe did find it very hard today. You can say he didn\xe2\x80\x99t score, yes. Is it on his mind? Of course, because he\xe2\x80\x99s a striker and he scored always many goals as a young player.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Sanogo, in fairness, was not the only Arsenal player that struggled on a day when Mesut \xc3\x96zil was anonymous. It was also a clear mistake to allow Laurent Koscielny to return to the pitch after he had required lengthy treatment following a clash of heads with Jeff Schlupp.</p> <p>When Schlupp broke away on the left, following a neat exchange with David Nugent, and delivered a superb centre towards the back post, Koscielny was caught ball-watching, unaware of Leonardo Ulloa, whose powerful header sailed into the far corner to quickly level the scores. Four minutes later Koscielny was withdrawn and replaced by Calum Chambers.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think if he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t injured we would not have conceded the goal,\xe2\x80\x9d Wenger said. \xe2\x80\x9cI had been told it was nothing serious and he could come back after two minutes with two clips on his head. That was a medical opinion. After that [Koscielny] asked to come off because he continued to bleed a little bit and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel comfortable moving.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Although Wenger bemoaned the lack of sharpness and creativity in his team, the Arsenal manager was quick to praise Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s spirited performance. Nigel Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s side worked tirelessly to make life uncomfortable for Arsenal but they also played with courage and were prepared to commit players forward.</p> <p>With two points from three tough opening fixtures, against Everton, Chelsea and Arsenal, Pearson is entitled to be pleased with the way that his players have acquitted themselves so far.</p> <p>Leicester may have had even more to show for their efforts here but Ulloa, set up by the lively Riyad Mahrez, could only find the side netting after sitting Chambers on his backside early in the second half.</p> <p>At the other end of the pitch Aaron Ramsey headed tamely into the hands of Schmeichel after Santi Cazorla\xe2\x80\x99s wonderful pitching wedge of a pass \xe2\x80\x93 the Spaniard delivered a similar ball in the lead up to S\xc3\xa1nchez\xe2\x80\x99s goal \xe2\x80\x93 and Sanogo shot straight at the Leicester keeper.</p> <p>It was that sort of day for Arsenal.</p> <p>Man of the match Riyad Mahrez (Leicester City)</p>'
