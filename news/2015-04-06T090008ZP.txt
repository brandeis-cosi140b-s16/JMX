b'Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend\xe2\x80\x99s action | Guardian writers'


b'1) Arsenal show developing Liverpool the way <p>The Arsenal v Liverpool match looked like what it should have: an uneven clash between two clubs at different stages of their development. Like Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s team have a strength in depth that Liverpool lack. And they appear to be forging a mentality that enables them to assert their prowess in big games, even if their non-performance in the home leg against Monaco in the Champions League means further proof is required before we make any conclusive judgment on that. Generally, though, there are good grounds for optimism at Arsenal, especially if the club\xe2\x80\x99s plans are enhanced by surprise boons such as the emergence of Francis Coquelin and H\xc3\xa9ctor Beller\xc3\xadn, neither of whom were expected to feature prominently, if at all, at the start of the season.</p> <p>The consistency that Beller\xc3\xadn has shown in virtually every match he has played since his ordeal in the defeat at Stoke in December could serve as an inspiration to some of Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s recent recruits, notably another young Spaniard, Alberto Moreno, who looked clueless when attempting to prevent Beller\xc3\xadn from scoring a wonderful opening goal at the Emirates. Moreno has goofed several times this season but has also shown plenty of promise. That could be said of many of the players Liverpool bought as they tried to build half a team with the proceeds of the sale of Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez. Several of them could emerge as influential players next season. Emre Can certainly should, preferably in midfield, even though he has done well in defence, his dumb sending off on Saturday notwithstanding. Liverpool will miss Can and Martin Skrtel on Wednesday when they go to Ewood Park in pursuit of the FA Cup that Brendan Rodgers now craves as he seeks evidence of progress from a patchy campaign. Rudy Gestede, who tormented a stronger Liverpool defence in the first match at Anfield, will be looking forward to that.

Some Newcastle fans were upset at that but they should not have been. Krul is an excellent professional who probably cares a lot more about his team than certain colleagues but football is also supposed to be about sportsmanship and he was just acknowledging a piece of exceptional skill. Surely he should be applauded, rather than condemned?

Photograph: James Marsh/BPI/Rex    <p>As Jonathan Walters laid the ball back to Charlie Adam 10 yards inside the Stoke half, your first instinct was to look towards Mame Biram Diouf. The Senegalese forward was the only realistic outlet for a player with Adam\xe2\x80\x99s range but his run had done little to tear him from Gary Cahill and the pass was not really on. By the time you had finished that train of thought, the ball was halfway through the air and it immediately became clear that no such reasoning had occurred to Adam, who admitted afterwards to seeing Thibaut Courtois off his line and asking himself \xe2\x80\x9cwhy not do it at a place like Chelsea?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Adam has done it before on a less exalted stage, and attempted it unsuccessfully on several other occasions, so a curmudgeon might reason that he who tries often enough will get it right once or twice. But the only important context here is that Adam had the brass neck to try it at the home of the league leaders \xe2\x80\x93 and speared the ball into a 66-yard arc of such power and accuracy that you concurred with Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho that the fault, if there was any from Chelsea, lay in sluggish closing down rather than Thibaut Courtois\xe2\x80\x99 positioning.</p> <p>Goal of the season? That was what Mourinho, seeking Adam out after the game, told the Stoke midfielder he had just produced. Despite particularly stern competition this weekend, he was probably right. \xe2\x80\x9cThe biggest thing is that you\xe2\x80\x99ve got the character, if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come off, to take the disappointment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam, and he was correct too. The best goals combine technical excellence with an outright lack of fear and, more often than not, come out with something you would never presume to see when watching a football match. Adam\xe2\x80\x99s effort at Stamford Bridge was more hit-and-expect than hit-and-hope, and that was what made his improbable intervention so thrilling.

If Adam bludgeoned his 66-yard shot with a three wood, Zamora was gracefully swinging a pitching wedge and the end result was every bit as devastating. There didn\xe2\x80\x99t even look to be a shot on when Zamora sprinted \xe2\x80\x93 as best as a 34-year-old who does not train can \xe2\x80\x93 into the inside right channel and, without breaking his stride, nonchalantly flicked the ball with the outside of his left boot to lob Boaz Myhill on the run. It was instinctive, effortless, judged to perfection and, to paraphrase Ruud Gullit, the sort of goal that Lionel Messi would have cherished. Whether it was better than the goal Zamora scored for Bath City against Grantham in January 2000 is a debate for another day. Stuart James</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: West Brom 1-4 QPR\xe2\x80\xa2 Charlie Austin: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m having a hell of a season. But Kane has scored 29\xe2\x80\x99</p>  5) Mailman Rooney always delivers <p>For some intriguing reason Wayne Rooney can still draw scepticism despite constantly delivering. The 79th-minute control-then-volley he smashed beyond Brad Guzan in Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s 3-1 win over Aston Villa was the latest entry into Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s ever-growing canon of Roy of the Rovers goals and did not go unnoticed by his team-mates. \xe2\x80\x9cI think the touch was actually better than the strike,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phil Jones. \xe2\x80\x9cHe plucked it out of the air with his weaker foot, swivelled on the half-volley and smacked it into the top corner. He does that week in, week out. Wayne\xe2\x80\x99s a leader and everybody follows him. He leads by example. He made a comment before the game saying it\xe2\x80\x99s no good beating Liverpool if you can\xe2\x80\x99t beat Aston Villa at Old Trafford and he was bang on.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He is also something else. Despite all the trophies and closing in on being the record goalscorer for United and England, Rooney is underrated: consistent excellence in any field is the mark of the very best, and he has been doing just that since he was a teenager.

Every now and then, though, some valid points are raised in the online arguments. Paul Merson\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing dispute with Andros Townsend has received rather too much attention already, but it does pose a pertinent question: just how good is the winger? Very good, if his England career is the sole guide: he has scored three times in seven games, averaging a goal every 116 minutes and delivering a glorious equaliser against Italy last week. But his time at Tottenham lends itself to a very different conclusion. Townsend has still only scored as many league goals for his club as he has managed in his brief international outings. He is yet to complete 90 minutes in the top flight this season and was granted just seven as a substitute at Burnley on Sunday. Merson asked Townsend if he missed the coach; another kind of coach \xe2\x80\x93 Mauricio Pochettino, rather than a four-wheeled vehicle \xe2\x80\x93 is clearly not particularly impressed. Paulinho, scarcely one of his favourites, began at Burnley. The underwhelming Erik Lamela came on before Townsend. His club days show few periods of fine form: perhaps when on loan at QPR, but they got relegated, and in September and October of 2013, prompting his international call-up, but apart from that his time in the Premier League has been undistinguished. He may be the opposite of many of the men who have underachieved for England in recent years: a far better player for country than club. Richard Jolly</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Burnley 0-0 Tottenham Hotspur\xe2\x80\xa2 Pochettino fears Champions League place is out of Spurs\xe2\x80\x99 reach\xe2\x80\xa2 Michael Cox: Tactical indecision results in deadlock at Turf Moor</p>  7) Southampton must now learn to break teams down <p>It was a line that has been used regularly in post-match press conferences at Goodison Park this season. \xe2\x80\x9cThey showed us a lot of respect and that made it difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d For a change, however, it was not Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez lamenting an opponent\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to sit deep but Ronald Koeman. The Southampton manager admitted the ambitious prospect of Champions League qualification was probably beyond his team following the 1-0 defeat at Everton. The visitors had their chances but were foiled by Tim Howard in the first half. In the second, however, they did not stretch the Everton goalkeeper once despite dominating possession and there was a glaring lack of creativity from Southampton as they pressed for an equaliser. \xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the space that players like Shane Long and Sadio Man\xc3\xa9 need,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted Koeman. Southampton will have to get used to confronting this new-found \xe2\x80\x9crespect\xe2\x80\x9d. Finding a solution \xe2\x80\x93 something Everton have struggled for after Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s impressive first season in charge \xe2\x80\x93 will be a determining factor in Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to build on a fine debut in English football next term. Andy Hunter</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Everton 1-0 Southampton\xe2\x80\xa2 Lukaku should not have joined Everton, says striker\xe2\x80\x99s new agent\xe2\x80\xa2 Southampton in profit for first time since 2009 to tune of \xc2\xa333.4m</p>  8) Does Allardyce suspect his time is up? <p>Sam Allardyce\xe2\x80\x99s demeanour was curiously relaxed, almost carefree, after his West Ham side were beaten at Leicester on Saturday. For those who attended Big Sam\xe2\x80\x99s press conferencesat Bolton, Newcastle and Blackburn, it was a curious and rather unsettling experience \xe2\x80\x93 as was seeing the number of chances the Hammers allowed Leicester to create in the final quarter, a period during which they seemed more intent on catching the Foxes on the break than on shoring up their creaking rearguard. But as Allardyce pointedly confirmed, that is how it has been since he got \xe2\x80\x9cthe big shout\xe2\x80\x9d (his words) at the beginning of the season that they had to attack more. The implication was clear: had he been allowed to instil a more discipline, West Ham would have accrued a darn sight more than 11 points from their last 14 games. Overall, however, it was hard not to leave with the impression that as far as he was concerned, next season will not be his problem. As if, in fact, the constant rumours suggesting his contract will not be renewed have a basis in fact \xe2\x80\x93 and he knows as much. Richard Rae</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Match report: Leicester 2-1 West Ham\xe2\x80\xa2 Jack Collison still chasing his footballing dream</p>      Sam Allardyce was not too pleased with what he was seeing as his West Ham side lost to bottom side Leicester City.

It\xe2\x80\x99s low and hard, heading into the bottom left corner of goal, but it\xe2\x80\x99s far from unstoppable and Allan McGregor dives to his right to keep it out. But the goalkeeper botches his save, spilling the ball into a dangerous area where an opponent prods it in while his marker dozes. It\xe2\x80\x99s a dismal, morale-sapping way to concede, and Hull are making a habit of it.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cCarroll supplied the breakthrough. McGregor will not enjoy the inquest and nor will Curtis Davies,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote David Hytner after Andy Carroll profited to give West Ham the lead in a 3-0 win against Hull in January. \xe2\x80\x9cValencia\xe2\x80\x99s shot from 25 yards was well struck but the goalkeeper appeared to be in the right position only to bat the ball back out centrally. Carroll reacted more quickly than Davies to tap home his fifth of an injury-truncated season.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey fell behind in the 18th minute,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote the Press Association on Saturday. \xe2\x80\x9cJonjo Shelvey\xe2\x80\x99s strike could have been held or pushed around the post by Allan McGregor, instead he pushed the ball out to the feet of Ki Sung-yueng, who accepted the invitation to score his seventh goal of the season with alacrity.\xe2\x80\x9d This time Alex Bruce was the dawdling defender.</p> <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s a horrible habit to fall into, although perhaps on this occasion McGregor was just rusty. After all, the statistics show that his miserably fluffed attempt to keep out Shelvey\xe2\x80\x99s shot was the Scotsman\xe2\x80\x99s only save in Hull\xe2\x80\x99s last two matches. Two weeks ago Chelsea scored all three of their shots on target in a narrow 3-2 win, while on Saturday Swansea had four shots on target and every one that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t flapped out to the nearest forward went straight in. It is unlikely to help their morale that statistically Lukasz Fabianski in the home goal fared even worse: Hull only had one, and scored. Not a good day for the goalkeepers.

Chelsea have lost twice all season, and have 70 points in the bank when a final tally of 82 may be enough. Costa\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal and recent injury struggles could have been more costly, however, were it not for another risk Mourinho took in the summer transfer window.</p> <p>Few players have retreated from Premier League view more dramatically this season than Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my; the French forward made 40 starts in 18 months with QPR and Newcastle, scoring a goal every other game. His appearances have dwindled, but the goalscoring ratio has remained strong. R\xc3\xa9my has started just four league games this season, scoring five goals - one every 93 minutes. That\xe2\x80\x99s better than Kane, Ag\xc3\xbcero \xe2\x80\x93 even Costa.</p> <p>R\xc3\xa9my, it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say, was signed as a backup to Costa, but not one without risks attached - at 28, he must have hoped to have made a bigger impact at Stamford Bridge, and he was little more than an afterthought in the first half of the season as Costa thrived. There have also been questions about his attitude, and health concerns that scuppered a summer move to Liverpool.</p> <p>Mourinho, who has allowed Romelu Lukaku, Fernando Torres, Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o, Andre Sch\xc3\xbcrrle and Demba Ba to leave the club permanently, took a risk in signing and then sidelining R\xc3\xa9my, with Costa starting whenever available and Didier Drogba offering a third forward option. The risk has paid off, with R\xc3\xa9my\xe2\x80\x99s last three strikes earning a point against Manchester City, a win at Hull, and another three points at home to Stoke on Saturday. Without that trio of close-range goals, Chelsea would be just two points ahead of the chasing pack. Niall McVeigh</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Chelsea lose Costa for key games with hamstring trouble</p> '
