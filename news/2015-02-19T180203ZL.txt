b'Luis Figo draws battle lines to replace Sepp Blatter as Fifa president | James Riach'


b'<p>It did not take long for Lu\xc3\xads Figo to receive a curve ball at his manifesto launch for the Fifa presidency. Asked if he could name any members of the organisation\xe2\x80\x99s executive committee the room, for a moment at least, fell awkwardly silent. There was a pause while the former footballer of the year processed his response, and then rattled off five.</p> <p>The question had caused embarrassment for a separate gimmick of a campaign last month by David Ginola so the mischievous interrogation was understandable, even if some might have hoped for a repeat faux-pas. Instead, Figo satisfied a few doubters and moved on to the next issue, covering an array of topics from racism to the World Cup during a stylish launch at Wembley that set to raise the profile of his bid to oust Sepp Blatter.</p> <p>Stylish it may have been yet the task Figo faces is immense. He has little over three months to convince Fifa\xe2\x80\x99s 209 member associations that he is the man to lead the world governing body and unseat Blatter, who is expected to secure a fifth term in office after 17 years.</p> <p>Along with the Dutch Football Association president, Michael van Praag, and the Jordanian executive committee member, Prince Ali bin al\xe2\x80\x91Hussein, there is hope that a genuine challenge can be made. Whether three contenders eventually become one \xe2\x80\x93 united and backed by Uefa \xe2\x80\x93 remains to be seen but Figo has already received high-profile support from David Beckham, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho and others.</p> <p>In reality, though, the 42-year\xe2\x80\x91old needs more than star-studded well\xe2\x80\x91wishers to stand any sort of chance in the Zurich election on 29 May. Given Blatter\xe2\x80\x99s hegemony in Africa and widespread support across Asia, South America and Oceania, there are numerous associations that will take some convincing if they are to switch allegiance.</p> <p>In such context, it is little surprise that Figo\xe2\x80\x99s manifesto \xe2\x80\x93 coined with the title #forfootball \xe2\x80\x93 appears to contain attractive proposals for associations outside Europe, aimed at enticing those whose vote will prove pivotal.</p> <p>He is the first candidate in the presidential race to release a full manifesto and his glossy 20-page document signs off with the message: \xe2\x80\x9cFootball runs through my veins, I am a man of football.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Perhaps the most radical of Figo\xe2\x80\x99s plans is a potential expansion of the World Cup to either 40 or 48 teams, significantly increasing the 32-nation tournament. In both cases the additional sides would be weighted towards non-European countries and the competition would be extended by three to four days. If 48 countries qualified, there would be two 24-team tournaments across two continents.</p> <p>Figo also proposes to reduce Fifa\xe2\x80\x99s cash reserves from $1.5bn (\xc2\xa3971m) to $500m, redistributing the $1bn surplus across all 209 member associations, arguing that there is no need to keep so much in the bank.</p> <p>He also intends to increase money invested into grassroots projects, pledging to inject half of Fifa\xe2\x80\x99s $2.5bn revenue over four years into grassroots.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think in the last few months we\xe2\x80\x99ve come to realise, maybe in the last few years, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen how Fifa\xe2\x80\x99s image has deteriorated,\xe2\x80\x9d said Figo, who had initially planned to launch his manifesto at Stamford Bridge until a change of plan on Wednesday.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn Brazil, during the World Cup, I witnessed all these protests against the organisation. Every time I went to a stadium and saw the reaction to the president of the organisation, it was quite negative.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a long road that we are on. I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to several people since I decided to present my candidacy. I have seen all these people, we have met bodies from different parts of the world.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe feedback I have received from the different associations really shows me that change is possible. I\xe2\x80\x99m also realistic, I know there are obstacles that we have to overcome.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0One of those obstacles, says Figo, is to convince associations across Africa that there will be continued, long-term benefits even if Blatter is deposed. The former Barcelona, Real Madrid and Internazionale winger recently spent 10 days on the continent \xe2\x80\x93 a Blatter stronghold \xe2\x80\x93 meeting with various federations.</p> <p>Figo vowed to implement a zero-tolerance policy towards racism following a week in which a group of Chelsea supporters aimed racist chants at a black man whom they refused to allow on to the Paris M\xc3\xa9tro after their Champions League match with Paris Saint-Germain, an incident that has been condemned by the club.</p> <p>His other manifesto proposals include: removing the triple punishment for those sent off for denying an obvious goalscoring opportunity in the penalty area, who also concede a spot-kick and pick up a suspension; increasing the use of technology in the game; introducing sin-bins for unsporting behaviour; and reverting to the old offside rule, whereby a player is judged offside whether directly involved in play or not.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI am an independent candidate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Figo, who is funding his campaign personally. \xe2\x80\x9cI am my own person, I have my own mind. But of course I am a global candidate. Of course I have spoken to the president of the European federation [Michel Platini], but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that I am backed up directly by one confederation.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs days go by, I am more and more hopeful about it. I started getting a lot of support from many, I am quite hopeful. I feel more and more convinced and feel stronger and stronger to achieve my objective.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In his manifesto, on the page next to Figo\xe2\x80\x99s glittering playing CV, is the quote: \xe2\x80\x9cMy focus as Fifa president will be to make sure more children, boys and girls, get the same opportunity I had. Better infrastructures, more training. It is time for me to give back to the world of football everything it gave to me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It is an admirable pledge in an age when alleged kick-backs and corruption have tarnished the image of the world governing body beyond repair. However, Figo\xe2\x80\x99s task is not to win the hearts of the footballing public, but to convince those who will need more than big words and bold promises.</p>'
