b'Mourinho: I told Hazard it was a game Chelsea will never lose \xe2\x80\x93 he complied'


b'<p>It said much for the way Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s afternoon had panned out that, when reflecting on a grind of a victory over Manchester United that leaves Chelsea two matches from the title, he was still pinpointing his most anxious moment of Saturday as having come around eight hours before kick-off \xe2\x80\x93 and in the lobby of the team\xe2\x80\x99s waterfront hotel.</p> <p>The manager had ambled down to breakfast, content in his week\xe2\x80\x99s tactical preparations in which Ruben Loftus-Cheek filled in as United\xe2\x80\x99s Marouane Fellaini back at Cobham to ensure Kurt Zouma was battle ready for the contest ahead. Then Mourinho bumped into the concierge to be told the Belgian could not be involved as he had just introduced himself at the front desk, dressed in jeans and having his picture taken with guests, and announced himself as \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Fellaini\xe2\x80\x9d to collect a pair of match tickets left for him by Eden Hazard.</p> <p>The Portuguese\xe2\x80\x99s first reaction was to be dumbstruck, albeit the silence quickly gave way to rather more colourful language, given a week of drills specifically designed to render this match \xe2\x80\x9c10 versus 10\xe2\x80\x9d had apparently gone to waste. Once the initial panic had subsided, his second was to reach for his smartphone and Google images of Fellaini\xe2\x80\x99s brother, Mansour. \xe2\x80\x9cI said to the doorman, \xe2\x80\x98Was it this one who was here?\xe2\x80\x99 and he pointed to the man who had come in,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cHa, he\xe2\x80\x99s the brother.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d That was about as jittery as it got.</p> <p>United may have dominated the ball at Stamford Bridge but Chelsea were largely content to let them operate at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length. Pragmatism has been prioritised of late, with rigid tactical diligence and discipline ensuring the lead established by the dazzling displays that had illuminated the first half of the season will not be lost. Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s visitors were bright and energetic, hogging the ball and menacing up to the six-yard box, but the hosts are experts at drawing the sting from high-calibre opponents.</p> <p>This side have not lost a league game to United, Manchester City, Arsenal or Liverpool since Mourinho returned to English football in 2013. Arsenal will need to wreck that record next Sunday if the title race is to be prolonged, in name only, into May but the management will presumably have another plan afoot to nullify Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez, Mesut \xc3\x96zil and co. Fellaini, such a menace of late during United\xe2\x80\x99s fine run, was suffocated by Zouma and, in Hazard, Chelsea had their own Belgian to wreak havoc.</p> <p>Where Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas and Diego Costa have excelled for periods this season, it is the 24-year-old playmaker who has consistently offered the leaders their forward propulsion. Hazard is a genius, a player capable of weaving through the clutter in possession to offer urgency and incision to a team that can, otherwise, lack invention against stubborn defence. His movement and speed of delivery ups the entire team\xe2\x80\x99s tempo. \xe2\x80\x9cHe makes the difference,\xe2\x80\x9d said Branislav Ivanovic. \xe2\x80\x9cHe gets kicked but never complains, works so hard all the time and is improving massively. He is flying. Give him the ball and he will do everything. Sometimes he looks like he is not from this world.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Next Sunday his fellow professionals may vote him the best in the country when the Professional Footballers\xe2\x80\x99 Association gathers for its annual awards evening. Memories will be fresh of his burst on to Oscar\xe2\x80\x99s backheel, United momentarily distracted as they appealed for a foul by John Terry on Radamel Falcao, with Hazard\xe2\x80\x99s clipped finish squeezed through David de Gea to provide this game\xe2\x80\x99s only goal. Hazard himself admits this has been his best campaign, last year having been blighted by moments where \xe2\x80\x9cI disappeared in some games\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is the humble star,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cPhysically, mentally, he\xe2\x80\x99s becoming very, very strong and he better understands his role.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe day before the United game I told him: \xe2\x80\x98This game we will never lose. Never.\xe2\x80\x99 But we needed to win. He understands clearly that, especially in a moment where the team doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have all its power, when the game becomes strategic, his talent is fundamental for the team. He copes better with the responsibility.\xe2\x80\x9d With Costa hamstrung and F\xc3\xa0bregas off colour, he is the player who ensures this side is something out of the ordinary. Chelsea could hope to blunt United, working as feverishly as ever all over the pitch to ensure their unbeaten home record was maintained, but it required a spark from the Belgian to leave them victorious.</p> <p>His intervention here, with an 18th goal of the season before the woodwork denied him further reward after the break, has taken Chelsea to the brink of their first league title in five years. Win at the Emirates Stadium next Sunday and the championship can be secured against Leicester City the following Wednesday. The mood at the final whistle on Saturday, while a much-improved United team licked their wounds, was one of joyous celebration, for all that the manager immediately reminded everyone the job is not yet done.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe want it done as soon as possible but if it\xe2\x80\x99s in the last game, so be it,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t go to Arsenal or to Leicester with the obsession of it has to be today.\xe2\x80\x9d Regardless, confirmation is close. This has been Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s title for some time.</p> <p>Man of the match Eden Hazard (Chelsea).</p>'
