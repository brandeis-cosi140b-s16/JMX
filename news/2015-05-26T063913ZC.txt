b'Carlo Ancelotti: Real Madrid confirm the departure of manager'


b'<p>Real Madrid have confirmed the departure of Carlo Ancelotti after two seasons at the Santiago Bernab\xc3\xa9u. Florentino P\xc3\xa9rez, the Real president, held a press conference on Monday when it was announced that the 55-year-old Italian is to leave with immediate effect despite having a year of his contract remaining.</p> <p>Ancelotti, who joined Real from Paris Saint-Germain in June 2013, won the Champions League and Copa del Rey in his first season. But after being eliminated from the Champions League at the semi-final stage by Juventus and failing to win La Liga, it is understood the former Chelsea manager was informed of his fate in a meeting yesterday.</p>  <p> Related: Dani Alves hits out at Barcelona for showing him \xe2\x80\x98lack of respect\xe2\x80\x99 </p>   <p>\xe2\x80\x9cCarlo is part of our history because he won the D\xc3\xa9cima for us,\xe2\x80\x9d said P\xc3\xa9rez. \xe2\x80\x9cBut here the demands are very high and we need to give Real Madrid a new push that allows us to reach the level that we want to be. It was a very difficult decision to make. The demands at this club are the utmost because Madrid always wants to win silverware.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe affection that the players and the fans have for Carlo is the same as the affection I myself have for him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ancelotti is set to have back surgery this summer to correct a long-standing problem and had indicated that he will take a break from football. \xe2\x80\x9cI can assure you that I have not lacked opportunities, from Italy, England and Germany. And I will not lack [offers] between now and next year,\xe2\x80\x9d he said last week. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I said it in the press conference and I repeat: I will stop for a year, also because I have a very serious reason for stopping.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI have to have an operation because of my cervical stenosis. For some time, it has been affecting my hands and if I lose any more time, it could pass into legs, so I have an appointment for surgery.</p>    <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I&#39;d like to keep in mind this two fantastic years at Real Madrid. Thanks to the club, the supporters and my players. #HalaMadridYNadaMas</p>&mdash; Carlo Ancelotti (@MrAncelotti) May 25, 2015    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAnd, frankly, I do not know how long I have to be physically stopped, in terms of the post-operative phase and the subsequent rehabilitation.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Napoli manager, Rafael Ben\xc3\xadtez, is the strong favourite to succeed Ancelotti at Real, with P\xc3\xa9rez confirming on Monday that an appointment would be made in the next week.</p>'
