b'<p>Brendan Rodgers accused Diego Costa of deliberately stamping on Emre Can and Martin Skrtel during a fiery Capital One Cup semi-final second leg that his Liverpool team lost narrowly to Branislav Ivanovic\xe2\x80\x99s extra-time goal for Chelsea.</p> <p>The Liverpool manager did nothing to conceal his unhappiness at Costa, who could face disciplinary proceedings from the Football Association because the referee, Michael Oliver, took no action on either occasion. A ban would potentially rule the striker out of Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League match at home to Manchester City.</p> <p>Skrtel could also be in trouble with the FA after a photograph emerged of him making an apparently offensive gesture.</p>  <p> Related: Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s TV conspiracy: six of the Chelsea manager\xe2\x80\x99s best complaints </p>   <p>The Chelsea manager, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho, offered a passionate defence of Costa, insisting that each of the flashpoints had been entirely accidental. He warmed to a familiar theme when he accused Sky TV of waging a campaign against his club.</p> <p>Mourinho was furious that the pundit Jamie Redknapp had criticised Costa for being \xe2\x80\x9cbang out of order\xe2\x80\x9d and having \xe2\x80\x9cput his studs in for a certain red card\xe2\x80\x9d, as Sky played footage of the striker\xe2\x80\x99s evening with the tag line \xe2\x80\x9cDiego Costa crimes\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Rodgers said: \xe2\x80\x9cHe [Costa] is an outstanding player \xe2\x80\x93 he obviously has this edge to him. We see the TV incidents, the two that he had. The one with Emre Can, that was poor, I felt. He could easily hurdle over the young player but he directs his studs right on to his ankle, which could have been nasty. And the one with Martin Skrtel \xe2\x80\x93 again, there\xe2\x80\x99s no need to do it. That\xe2\x80\x99s the sad thing. He\xe2\x80\x99s a top-class player and he\xe2\x80\x99s clever enough that the officials don\xe2\x80\x99t see it. But it\xe2\x80\x99s poor by him because he\xe2\x80\x99s an outstanding player and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>           Diego Costa acted poorly during Liverpool versus Chelsea match, says Brendan Rogers \xe2\x80\x93 video    <p>Rodgers was asked whether he was surprised that Oliver and his assistants had missed the controversies. \xe2\x80\x9cThey clearly didn\xe2\x80\x99t [see],\xe2\x80\x9d Rodgers said. \xe2\x80\x9cShould he have had a red card? That\xe2\x80\x99s up to the officials. It certainly would have been. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t good for the game. The referee didn\xe2\x80\x99t see it. It\xe2\x80\x99s not my job to tell him. It\xe2\x80\x99s disappointing when you see such a good player behave like that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Diego Costa tries to light up Chelsea with his dark arts against Liverpool | Barney Ronay </p>   <p>Mourinho was clearly irritated when Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 comments were relayed to him and it was easy to feel that the relationship he once enjoyed with him when Rodgers worked under him at Chelsea had thawed.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe are very different persons,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said. \xe2\x80\x9cI could speak about Skrtel and I don\xe2\x80\x99t. He speaks about [Thibaut] Courtois [the Chelsea goalkeeper, who made vital saves] and he forgets [Simon] Mignolet [who also made saves]. To say Courtois played fantastic \xe2\x80\x93 I could say the same about Mignolet. He is a fantastic manager but we are different persons.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho was furious that Oliver did not award Costa a penalty in the 23rd minute, after the striker had been clattered by Skrtel and he felt that Jordan Henderon and Lucas Leiva ought to have received second yellow cards. Mourinho was making the point so forcibly to the fourth official, Phil Dowd, that he did not see Ivanovic head home the only goal of the second leg from Willian\xe2\x80\x99s free-kick.</p>  <p> Related: Chelsea 1-0 Liverpool (aet; Chelsea win 2-1 on aggregate) | Capital One Cup semi-final second leg match report </p>   <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you understand by a stamp,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said of the incidents with Costa. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe you are already influenced by the campaign on the television with the certain pundit saying that Costa has crimes. They must be nuts, the guy who says that. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t speak about the penalty. If I comment about that, I will be in trouble. Sky calls it a crime \xe2\x80\x93 I have to say that he goes to the ball, he chases it, the opponent goes to the floor and he puts his foot there, when he is looking at the ball. It is a great campaign.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe know how much that pundit loves Chelsea, so you are sitting there, you are very well-paid, these guys have a good seat, earning a lot of money, no pressure, they are never wrong \xe2\x80\x93 they have to be fair and they have to be honest.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho was asked to specify which pundit he was referring to but he refused. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know his name because when I see him, I switch off the television,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s passage to a Wembley final against Tottenham Hotspur or Sheffield United was hard-fought and it featured injuries to Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas (hamstring), Filipe Lu\xc3\xads (calf) and Ivanovic (foot). Mourinho said that F\xc3\xa0bregas had been withdrawn because he felt he was on the brink of a serious injury and that Ivanovic\xe2\x80\x99s boot was covered in blood after a tackle. Ivanovic was able to last the 120 minutes.</p>'
