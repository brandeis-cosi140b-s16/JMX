b'QPR v Chelsea: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>You could see it coming a mile off. Chelsea were underwhelming throughout, and scored with their only shot on target. Chelsea regain their seven-point lead at the top of the table, with a game in hand. It is also a massive plus for Mourinho that neither the goalscorer Fabregas or Matic were booked, which means that they will be available to face Manchester United and Arsenal, Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s next two fixtures.</p> <p>QPR\xe2\x80\x99s players worked hard \xe2\x80\x93 Hill, Onuoha and Barton were particularly impressive \xe2\x80\x93 but I can\xe2\x80\x99t help feeling that with the players at their disposal, they are better off going all-out attack, a la Villa, rather than trying to play conservatively. QPR are two points short of Hull in 17th.</p>    <p>I don&#39;t care about the result. We made Chelsea look ordinary and had the better chances. We will bounce back. Proud of everyone.</p>&mdash; Tony Fernandes (@tonyfernandes) April 12, 2015    <p>Tony you should care pal. Thanks for your emails and tweets, making a poor game bearable. See you next time! Bye!</p>'
