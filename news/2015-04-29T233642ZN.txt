b"Nigel Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s rant in full: Leicester manager's 'ostrich' outburst"


b'<p>After Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s loss to Chelsea Nigel Pearson became embroiled in an argument with reporter Ian Baker, ending in the manager storming out having called Baker an ostrich. Read the transcript in full below:</p> <p>Nigel Pearson The bottom line is what has given us a chance to survive has been the collective spirit we have. To win four games on the spin at any level, but certainly at Premier League level, is difficult and for the players to have to deal with the amount of criticism and negativity they\xe2\x80\x99ve had to endure over the course of the season has tested us. Without wanting to talk too much, the players come out with awful lot of credit for dealing with setbacks and I expect them to deal with tonight\xe2\x80\x99s setback as well.</p> <p>Ian Baker What criticism are you talking about?</p> <p>NP Have you been on holiday for six months? Have you been away for six months?</p> <p>IB No, I am just not quite sure what specific criticism you are referring to?</p>         Watch the rant in full    <p>NP I think you must have either your head in the clouds, or been away on holiday, or reporting on a different team, because if you don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that question . . your question is absolutely unbelievable, the fact you do not understand where I am coming from. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that question then I think you are an ostrich. Your head must be in the sand. Is your head in the sand? Are you flexible enough to get your head in the sand? My suspicion would be no.</p> <p>IB Probably not.</p> <p>NP  I can, you can\xe2\x80\x99t. You can\xe2\x80\x99t. Listen you have been here often enough and for you to ask that question, you are either being very, very silly or you are being absolutely stupid, one of the two because for you to ask that question, I am sorry son, you are daft.</p> <p>IB There hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been much harsh criticism of the players.</p> <p>NP  You are wrong. No, you are wrong. You have been in here, I know you have so don\xe2\x80\x99t give that crap with me, please don\xe2\x80\x99t give that crap with me. I will smile at you because I can afford to smile at you. Now do you want to ask a different question or do you want to ask it differently. Come on, ask it. Ask it or are you not capable?</p> <p>IB I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you, erm ...</p> <p>NP (mimicking his voice) You don\xe2\x80\x99t know. What\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x99erm\xe2\x80\x99?</p> <p>IB I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you\xe2\x80\x99ve taken that question.</p> <p>NP Well you must be very stupid. I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry. (Pearson gets up and leaves)</p>    <p>If getting called an ostrich by Nigel Pearson is not a career highlight i don&#39;t know what is.</p>&mdash; Ian Baker (@ianbakersport) April 29, 2015    Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s previous flashpoints <p>1. Verbal confrontation with a fan </p> <p>Pearson was fined \xc2\xa310,000 and handed a one-match touchline ban after after arguing with a fan during the club\xe2\x80\x99s loss to Liverpool in December. The FA found him guilty of using \xe2\x80\x9cabusive and/or insulting words towards a spectator\xe2\x80\x9d. He said later: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had run-ins with fans in the past and in the heat of the moment these things happen. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to repeat what happened on either side. I\xe2\x80\x99m more than happy to stand up for myself in that situation. If people were offended then that is regrettable. But there is no need to apologise to somebody of that ilk.\xe2\x80\x9d </p> <p>2. Altercation with James McArthur </p> <p>Pearson was involved in a bizarre incident with a former transfer target, James McArthur, during his side\xe2\x80\x99s 1-0 home defeat to Crystal Palace in February. Pearson was bowled over on the touchline by McArthur after a tackle by Marc Albrighton, resulting in what was initially a friendly exchange. But after the manager playfully grabbed McArthur around the throat before helping him to his feet, he then prevented him from returning to the pitch by grabbing hold of his shirt. Asked why he refused to let go of McArthur, Pearson replied: \xe2\x80\x9cBecause he said something to me.\xe2\x80\x9d Asked to elaborate, Pearson added: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have to reveal anything do I? I\xe2\x80\x99m more than capable of looking after myself.\xe2\x80\x9d </p>     Nigel Pearson gets to grips with Palace\xe2\x80\x99s James McArthur in February.    <p>3. Angered by Match of the Day comments </p> <p>Pearson hit out at Match of the Day pundits for making a \xe2\x80\x9cmountain out of a molehill\xe2\x80\x9d following his clash with McArthur. Pearson thought the way it was covered by Gary Lineker, Danny Murphy and Jermaine Jenas was unfair. He said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not helpful when the three fountains of knowledge on Match of the Day make a mountain out molehill, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in that on Saturday. The lad\xe2\x80\x99s OK and it was very light hearted. How it was reported was totally inaccurate. You\xe2\x80\x99re looking for news which is not there.\xe2\x80\x9d Lineker responded by tweeting: \xe2\x80\x9cAh Nigel Pearson is blaming MOTD for making a mountain out of a molehill. We\xe2\x80\x99d best be careful in future, the fella can look after himself.\xe2\x80\x9d </p> <p>4. And another argument with a journalist </p>            <p>Following Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s 0-0 draw with Hull, Pearson was riled when a reporter asked him whether his team were \xe2\x80\x9cwaxing\xe2\x80\x9d or waning\xe2\x80\x9d in the relegation run-in. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have to use that sort of analogy,\xe2\x80\x9d he responded. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are in the same position. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got ten games left, six games at home, and our home form has to be drastically improved for us to give ourselves the best chance. That\xe2\x80\x99s it. You got any more questions you want to ask? Obviously not.\xe2\x80\x9d Pearson can then clearly be heard saying: \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99Waxing or waning?\xe2\x80\x99, fucking hell. My arse,\xe2\x80\x9d before getting up and appearing to utter the word: \xe2\x80\x9cPrick.\xe2\x80\x9d </p>'
