b'<p>This time there was no sprint down the touchline from Tim Sherwood. Instead the abiding image of the afternoon was of the Aston Villa manager standing on the edge of his technical area with his head in his hands after Per Mertesacker, with the easiest of headers, scored Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s third. There were still 28 minutes remaining and, as Sherwood retreated to the dugout and closed his eyes for a moment, it was easy to imagine the Villa manager wishing that the final whistle could be blown there and then.</p>  <p> Related: FA Cup final: Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez inspires Arsenal to win over Aston Villa </p>   <p>Over in the royal box Randy Lerner, the Villa owner, and Prince William, a fan of the Midlands club, stared into the distance. Moments earlier the two of them had shared a laugh. Now the game was up. A day that had started with hopes of winning a first piece of silverware since 1996, and a first FA Cup in 58 years, had turned into an exercise in damage limitation. So much for the fairytale ending that had Lerner, who has been desperately trying to sell the club for the past few years, bowing out with a trophy.</p> <p>The question beforehand had been whether Villa were capable of replicating the superb performance they produced against Liverpool in the semi-final; the simple answer was that Arsenal were never going to let them. Villa were outclassed and outplayed and at times it seemed as if the occasion was too much for them. The brutal truth is that Sherwood\xe2\x80\x99s players never really turned up.</p> <p>Sherwood\xe2\x80\x99s message to the players since he took over as manager in February has been to \xe2\x80\x9ctake the shackles off\xe2\x80\x9d and play with freedom, yet this vapid display was a throwback to the Paul Lambert days. Villa looked inhibited and nervous, failed to play with any tempo and spent much of the afternoon chasing shadows. When they did seize possession, their football was pedestrian and ponderous.</p> <p>It was embarrassingly one-sided and, while it can be dangerous at times to reach too much into statistics, this was not one of those occasions when the numbers lied. Arsenal had 25 attempts on goal. Villa managed two, both of which were blocked. Wojciech Szczesny could have taken the day off.</p> <p>Tackles were desperate, late and cynical at times as Villa tried in vain to stem the tide of yellow shirts pouring forward. Tom Cleverley, Alan Hutton and Fabian Delph received yellow cards inside the opening 37 minutes and Ashley Westwood and Gabriel Agbonlahor were booked in the second half. It is not that Villa were dirty; they were just so far off the pace.</p> <p>Sherwood takes defeat badly \xe2\x80\x93 he revealed in the lead-up to the final that it is not unusual for him to shed a tear after losing \xe2\x80\x93 and he looked crestfallen at the end. His primary aim of keeping Villa in the Premier League has been achieved \xe2\x80\x93 and it was no mean achievement given the terrible mess the club were in when he replaced Lambert \xe2\x80\x93 but it will take some time for him to get this humiliating defeat out of the system.</p> <p>As for Christian Benteke, if this turns out to be the final game of his Villa career \xe2\x80\x93 and that will almost certainly be the case \xe2\x80\x93 it was not much of a way to sign off. Isolated in attack and suffering from a chronic lack of service, Benteke was a peripheral figure for much of the afternoon. To add insult to injury it was Benteke who allowed Mertesacker to get away from him for that third goal.</p> <p>It was an unimpressive audition for a big summer transfer but it would be harsh to make any sort of judgment on him on a day when so many Villa players underperformed. Liverpool will certainly not be put off and the expectation is that the Merseyside club will meet the \xc2\xa332.5m release clause in Benteke\xe2\x80\x99s contract over the coming weeks. There is also a possibility that Chelsea will enter the race. Either way Sherwood knows he is powerless to keep Benteke and that leaves a huge hole to fill in a summer of rebuilding.</p> <p>Other key individuals were subdued here. Delph, such a driving force in midfield over the last few months, was unable to exert any influence on the game and the sight of Mesut \xc3\x96zil \xe2\x80\x93 of all people \xe2\x80\x93 dispossessing the England international inside the Villa half in the early stages was symptomatic of the way Sherwood\xe2\x80\x99s side started the game.</p> <p>Cleverley, who is now a free agent and also likely to have played his final game in a Villa shirt, was a passenger in a midfield that Arsenal controlled while Charles N\xe2\x80\x99Zogbia looked like a substitution waiting to happen well before his number came up eight minutes into the second half.</p> <p>So much had been expected of Jack Grealish \xe2\x80\x93 perhaps too much for a 19-year-old who made his first Premier League start only last month \xe2\x80\x93 and it was hard for the teenager to make much impression against an Arsenal side that were totally dominant. Grealish, who had a decent appeal for a penalty turned down late on when H\xc3\xa9ctor Beller\xc3\xadn tugged at his shirt, will have to wait to follow in the footsteps of his great-grandfather, Billy Garraty, who won the FA Cup with Villa in 1905.</p> <p>Another penalty claim had been rejected earlier in the second half when Gabriel Agbonlahor, N\xe2\x80\x99Zogbia\xe2\x80\x99s replacement, tumbled to the ground but Sherwood knew better than to make too much of either incident and made the point that he did not want to be seen to be making excuses. The reality is that Villa were comprehensively beaten and that long wait for an eighth FA Cup goes on.</p>'
