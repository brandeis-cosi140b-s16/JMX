b'Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Raheem Sterling to face Sunderland after break from burnout'


b'<p>Raheem Sterling is scheduled to return for Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League visit to Sunderland on Saturday having been given a new year break by Brendan Rodgers to reduce the risk of burnout.</p> <p>The 20-year-old missed Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 win at AFC Wimbledon in the FA Cup third round on Monday as he was on holiday in Jamaica. The England international was given time off by Rodgers after again leading the line in the 2-2 draw against Leicester City at Anfield on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, his 34th appearance of the season for club and country. Sterling has spent the past few days in the country of his birth but is due back on Merseyside in time for the weekend trip to the Stadium of Light.</p> <p>Rodgers has been keen to rest Sterling several times this term but the winger\xe2\x80\x99s growing importance, combined with Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s difficult campaign, has restricted the number of opportunities available. He was given a break against Aston Villa earlier in the season, appearing as a 61st-minute substitute in the 1-0 defeat, and was also on the bench at Real Madrid in the Champions League but had started 13 games in succession prior to the FA Cup tie at Kingsmeadow.</p> <p>Liverpool have six games in 21 days this month, including the Capital One Cup semi-finals against Chelsea and the FA Cup fourth-round meeting against Bolton Wanderers at Anfield, and Rodgers is keen to protect a key player who has been instrumental in the team\xe2\x80\x99s recent recovery. Sterling has scored three goals in six matches since becoming the focal point of Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 3-4-2-1 formation, with his tireless displays keeping Mario Balotelli, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini on the bench.</p> <p>Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s representatives are in talks over a new contract and Anfield officials remain confident of finalising terms in the near future.</p>'
