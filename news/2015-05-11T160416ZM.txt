b'Manchester City offer Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 to try to land Juventus\xe2\x80\x99s Paul Pogba'


b'<p>Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s determination to prise Paul Pogba from Juventus has led to Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 being offered as a makeweight in a deal for the Frenchman, who is valued at \xe2\x82\xac100m (\xc2\xa371.5m) by the Italian champions. City have visited Turin to hold talks over a potential transfer for the 22-year-old.</p> <p>They face competition from Real Madrid, Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and Manchester United, who signed the midfielder from Le Havre in July 2009 before allowing him to depart on a free to Juve three summers later.</p> <p>City have offered not only Tour\xc3\xa9, whose relationship with the club is troubled, but Samir Nasri, Stevan Jovetic, Aleksandar Kolarov and Edin Dzeko to Juventus should the Serie A club wish to include one or more in any deal for Pogba. City are the only club to have gone to Turin to firm up their interest in buying a player who would be the ideal replacement for Tour\xc3\xa9 and would be expected to be the mainstay of the midfield for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Juve are reluctant to sell but will listen to offers in the region of \xe2\x82\xac100m, though their preference would be a straight cash deal and it remains to be seen if they would accept a player in part-exchange.</p> <p>Pogba\xe2\x80\x99s first choice is to play for Real Madrid or Barcelona, with City then favourites ahead of PSG. Real\xe2\x80\x99s interest has caused Zinedine Zidane, coach of their Castilla \xe2\x80\x98B\xe2\x80\x99 team, to make contact with the player\xe2\x80\x99s camp by telephone to begin a dialogue. At the end of March Zidane told Canal+: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we are talking about a player like Pogba, it is only logical Real Madrid are interested in signing him. He is a player with immense potential, who still has an important margin for improvement. He is still young and has an exciting future ahead of him. Where Pogba will play next season? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the answer to that question. You will have to ask him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Although Barcelona have a transfer ban for 2015 imposed by Fifa, they may be able sign Pogba and loan him back to Juve before registering him next year.</p> <p>City\xe2\x80\x99s sporting director, Txiki Begiristain, and chief executive, Ferran Soriano, are willing to offer Pogba around \xc2\xa3250,000 a week, a figure in the region of that earned by Tour\xc3\xa9, the club\xe2\x80\x99s highest-paid player. Despite Juventus being in the Champions League semi-finals the executive hope to sell Pogba a vision of City as an ongoing domestic force whose progress has enabled them to reach the last 16 of that competition for the past two seasons, with the Frenchman viewed as the driving force to take them to the next level.</p> <p>City hope that Pogba can be joined by Wolfsburg\xe2\x80\x99s Kevin De Bruyne, who at 23 would be part of a fresh dynamic team. Patrick De Koster, De Bruyne\xe2\x80\x99s agent, confirmed City\xe2\x80\x99s interest. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a meeting with Klaus Allofs [Wolfsburg\xe2\x80\x99s sporting director] next week to find out what they want to do,\xe2\x80\x9d he told TalkSport. \xe2\x80\x9cI will know if they want to offer Kevin a new deal or allow him to move. Manchester City, Bayern Munich and PSG have made informal contact with me, but there have been no official offers.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe situation has now changed with Wolfsburg qualifying for the Champions League next season, so wherever he plays next season it will be in the Champions League. If Wolfsburg decide to sell Kevin, then he will have a choice of clubs who can win their domestic league and challenge for the Champions League as well. The choice is his.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Although Tour\xc3\xa9 has been offered as a makeweight for Pogba there is no guarantee the Ivorian will leave the club this summer, though with his agent, Dimitry Seluk, claiming it is \xe2\x80\x9c90%\xe2\x80\x9d certain he will do so, City are considering their options.</p> <p>Dzeko, Nasri, Jovetic, and Kolarov are viewed as others who could leave, each of them having disappointing seasons for the club in a Premier League title defence that fell away since 1 January when City were joint-leaders alongside Chelsea, who sealed the title last week.</p>'
