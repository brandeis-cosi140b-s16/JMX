b'Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho defends Diego Costa after win over Hull'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho was in full flow, detailing the education being offered Diego Costa by his new team-mates on the foibles of English football and insisting that only two of the Spain forward\xe2\x80\x99s seven cautions this season had been justified, when the referee Chris Foy shuffled past the huddle outside the changing rooms. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Chelsea manager. \xe2\x80\x9cMr Foy. Mr Foy. Come and tell the guys, please. Diego is crying in the dressing room because you gave him a yellow card, and these guys are asking me why.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The official initially appeared embarrassed, craving the anonymity of the darkness at the end of the tunnel. But, rather than escaping into the night, he paused and eventually drew a handkerchief from his pocket, handing it to Mourinho, presumably for Costa to dry his eyes. The manager cracked up in fits of hysterics, the mood instantly lightened, even if his concern over Costa\xe2\x80\x99s reputation preceding him will persist. No one has been booked more often in the Premier League this season than the Brazil-born forward, a player whose eagerness to rough up opposing centre-halves alerted referees to potential trouble before the season started.</p> <p>The aggression will bring the type of disciplinary problems Mourinho will accept. His objection has been over the perceived softer yellows, for petty fouls and now, more than once, for diving. Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s incident of simulation came just before the hour mark, when he tumbled a little too theatrically over Tom Huddlestone\xe2\x80\x99s threat of a challenge. Costa did not stay grounded for long or, indeed, appeal for a free-kick but was cautioned regardless. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t believe seven bookings because I remember two that are understandable and fair,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cOne was against Newcastle, because he complained with the referee with arms in the air and body language that was not acceptable for referees.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe other one was against Liverpool, when there was a really aggressive duel with [Martin] Skrtel, fighting in a yellow-card way. All the others [were incorrect]: the first one at Burnley is a penalty and a red card for the keeper; other times when it was not simulation; or when he touches one guy and it is a yellow card. Everything he does is a yellow. But seven? It looks like everybody comes ready for him. When he was at Atl\xc3\xa9tico he created a certain image and people don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that he can change \xe2\x80\xa6 that we can teach him what English football is \xe2\x80\x93 the mentality, what people accept, what is a red card here. People don\xe2\x80\x99t see he is intelligent enough to understand it. He has changed.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Those changes were instigated in talks with staff and team-mates, the likes of Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas and C\xc3\xa9sar Azpilicueta warning the forward how any hint of an elbow or tackle from behind would be punished. He has apparently taken that advice on board, not that the card tally to date would suggest as much and his yellow card on Saturday did not feel outrageous. Rather more in focus was Foy\xe2\x80\x99s overall performance, and particularly his decision to spare Gary Cahill a dismissal, either for a lunge at Sone Aluko or his own dive between Huddlestone and David Meyler while the hosts\xe2\x80\x99 lead was still restricted to Eden Hazard\xe2\x80\x99s early header.</p> <p>Steve Bruce denounced that as theatrics better suited for Swan Lake, with frustration at the non-award \xe2\x80\x93 particularly given the referee had been willing to caution Willian and, later, Costa for the same offence \xe2\x80\x93 soon gripping Huddlestone. The midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s horrible challenge on Filipe Lu\xc3\xads merited the red card. He now faces a four-match suspension, after earlier picking up his fifth caution of the season, and will also be fined by his club. \xe2\x80\x9cKnowing Tom the way I do, he\xe2\x80\x99ll be disappointed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruce. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was an accumulation of reasons why it happened.\xe2\x80\x9d Not least the way the match was slipping away.</p> <p>This was Hull\xe2\x80\x99s ninth game without a win, the defeat confirmed by Costa\xe2\x80\x99s first goal in four matches, though there was a show of support from the travelling fans for their beleaguered manager. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, they only chanted my name because of the way their team played, and rightly so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruce.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEven with 10 men, they\xe2\x80\x99re still competing. I appreciate their support, but if they keep seeing their team perform like that, then I think they\xe2\x80\x99d see as much as I do: I\xe2\x80\x99m convinced we\xe2\x80\x99ll be OK.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The loss of Michael Dawson, for at least a month, with a hamstring was a blow, while Hatem Ben Arfa\xe2\x80\x99s time at the club is clearly over with the player training alone in Paris. These are troubled times.</p>'
