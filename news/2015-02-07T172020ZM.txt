b'Manchester City 1-1 Hull City | Premier League match report'


b'<p>Eighty-five years had passed since Hull last defeated Manchester City away. That sequence continues but only just as Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s team came mightily close to a third home loss on the bounce, a result that would have left their title defence hanging by a thread.</p> <p>Pellegrini was stalking the technical area hoping for a late equaliser or better during the closing minutes. Despite a fine Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero attempt that hit the bar, it appeared it would never come. But then, two minutes into added time, James Milner, a substitute, drilled a 20-yard free-kick beyond Allan McGregor and the hosts had snatched a draw.</p> <p>With their win at Aston Villa, it meant Chelsea extended their lead to seven but it could easily have been nine.</p> <p>However, City\xe2\x80\x99s most recent league win remains the 3-2 victory over Sunderland on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day. Since then, the champions have drawn 1-1 at Everton, lost 2-0 to Arsenal at home and shared a goalless draw with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge.</p>  <p> Related: Aston Villa 1-2 Chelsea | Premier League match report </p>   <p>There was also the embarrassment of being knocked out of the FA Cup by Middlesbrough here and so with this result City must hope to finally secure a league victory again at Stoke on Wednesday.</p> <p>However much the manager denies it, the champions continue to miss Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9, whose Ivory Coast take on Ghana in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99sAfrica Cup of Nations final. This was the fifth match without the midfielder. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have no doubt about how important a player Yaya is. But we play other games without Yaya and we could win,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini said.</p> <p>The first half was a contender for their poorest this season. By the close City were 1-0 down and being booed off by some of their fans, a sentiment the players could hardly argue with. Passes had gone awry, first touches were clumsy and their play was simply too slow. City had sleepwalked through the half and if the manager put a proverbial flea in each of his players\xe2\x80\x99 ears at the break, the sight of Edin Dzeko being caught in possession soon after the referee, Jonathan Moss, blew to start the second half must surely have angered him.</p> <p>David Meyler\xe2\x80\x99s opener, his first goal since April\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup semi-final win over Sheffield United, was a gift following a calamitous series of errors from the home defence.</p> <p>The chief culprit was Mart\xc3\xadn Demichelis, the central defender again preferred to the \xc2\xa340m Eliaquiam Mangala, who was a substitute.</p> <p>Before the mistake that initiated Meyler\xe2\x80\x99s strike, Demichelis had over-hit a back-pass at Joe Hart. This caused the goalkeeper to miscue a hack away, sending the ball up in the air and when Demichelis tried to clean up the mess he had created the Argentinian contrived only to connect a boot with air.</p>  <p> Related: Nigel Pearson plays down drama after James McArthur touchline tangle </p>   <p>The episode was an unwanted augury. Moments later Hart could have collected the ball but this time Demichelis intervened to kick it away from his keeper\xe2\x80\x99s hands.</p> <p>Then disaster struck. A Jake Livermore shot was superbly saved by Hart, but from the rebound Gaston Ram\xc3\xadrez\xe2\x80\x99s effort beat the keeper, struck his left post, and, following up, Meyler smashed home from close range.</p> <p>Thirty-five minutes had been played but the goal had been coming all half. Earlier, a Robbie Brady cross from the left was headed against the bar by Ahmed Elmohamady after he too easily beat Ga\xc3\xabl Clichy.</p> <p>Time and space were constantly available to Hull, something no champion-elect side should allow. Five minutes before the interval Sone Aluko could have doubled the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 advantage but instead blasted over from close range.</p> <p>City had only a weak Dzeko header that was aimed at McGregor and a sweet surge from Vincent Kompany that ended with him dinking a pass into Ag\xc3\xbcero\xe2\x80\x99s path to show before the players turned around.</p> <p>What followed was a far brighter effort, the least that was expected following a dismal opening half. David Silva may have been right to be angered when Moss denied him a penalty after Alex Bruce bundled him over in the area but the problem was that despite more huffing and puffing City still suffered a sharpness deficit.</p> <p>Kompany summed up the day his side were having when he blocked a shot from Silva and as the final 10 minutes arrived. Fernando, Dzeko and the Spaniard had all been pulled from the starting XI as Pellegrini desperately tried to avert a devastating reverse. In the end the Chilean did. But there must be concern.</p>'
