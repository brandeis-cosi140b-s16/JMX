b'Aston Villa 3-3 QPR | Premier League match report'


b'<p>The Premier League title race may have run out of legs but this battle to avoid relegation is promising to provide ample compensation. Christian Benteke scored a hat-trick to lift Aston Villa three points above the basement zone just when it appeared Charlie Austin\xe2\x80\x99s 17th goal of the season had earned Queens Park Rangers a second win in four days in the West Midlands to climb clear.</p> <p>Villa remain the lowest scorers in the division but under Tim Sherwood they have rediscovered their attacking mojo, no one more so than Benteke, whose equalising free-kick seven minutes from time was his seventh goal in his last five games. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get much better than that,\xe2\x80\x9d the Villa manager said in appreciation of his talisman.</p> <p>Sherwood endured mixed emotions on his reunion with Chris Ramsey, his opposite number in the dugout and longstanding coaching colleague, and now faces another homecoming as Villa visit Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday before their FA Cup semi-final at Wembley. At least life is no longer dull at Villa.</p> <p>QPR had lost 13 out of 14 games under Ramsey before winning four miles across Birmingham on Saturday at West Bromwich Albion and they must have believed they had chalked up another victory when Austin put them 3-2 up in the 78th minute. How that would have put pep in their boots before Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s derby with champions elect Chelsea.</p> <p>Sherwood and Ramsey embraced on the touchline before kick-off as they briefly acknowledged a friendship that had to be put on hold because of the significance of this match. By the end they could afford to renew good relations but it was the Villa manager who could afford to smile more, keeping a rival beneath them, even though he thought a boxing referee would have ended the fight at half-time, so dominant were Villa at that stage.</p> <p>Ramsey could claim a tactical coup as his switch from 4-4-2 to 3-5-2 early in the second half helped turn the game QPR\xe2\x80\x99s way, Armand Traor\xc3\xa9 coming on to offer pace on the left flank as Matt Phillips stayed very wide on the right and it was the former Wycombe Wanderers flyer who added to his opener by making QPR\xe2\x80\x99s two second-half goals.</p> <p>In four successive visits to Villa Park, QPR have taken the lead and failed to win. So perhaps the home side should not have panicked unduly when Phillips dived to head in Bobby Zamora\xe2\x80\x99s cross from the left edge of the box in the seventh minute. But the manner in which Villa\xe2\x80\x99s nervy back four failed to deal with Austin\xe2\x80\x99s initial right-wing centre was evidence of the edginess pervading both sets of players defensively.</p> <p>Sherwood unzipped his jacket at this disappointment. Within three minutes, he was throwing it to the ground in unbridled jubilation as Villa equalised. Benteke probably could not believe how much freedom he was allowed as his goals turned the game on its head by half-time.</p> <p>The Belgian looked marginally offside as he ran on to Fabian Delph\xe2\x80\x99s pass down the left wing. Mauricio Isla looked simply terrified as he allowed Benteke to cut back inside on to his favoured right foot as they entered the penalty area and strike a shot that deflected up off the Chilean defender and over Robert Green into the far corner of the net.</p> <p>Villa, cheered on wildly by Stan Collymore in the press box, proceeded to pepper the Rangers goal. Ron Vlaar, back after six weeks out with a calf injury, hammered a shot that nigh on knocked out Sandro. Gabriel Agbonlahor was hauled back by Clint Hill as the striker rolled his man going into the penalty area. Benteke saw his header from Leandro Bacuna\xe2\x80\x99s cross deflected just wide but the dam had to burst.</p> <p>Carlos S\xc3\xa1nchez won a crucial tackle against Niko Kranjcar on the edge of the Villa penalty area for Agbonlahor to nick the ball into the QPR half just as Sandro took him out. Benteke rampaged forwards and, turning inside the hapless Hill, calmly dinked home.</p> <p>The interval came at the right time for QPR, who not only had a chance to regroup but soon to reshape. With Karl Henry introduced as a third central midfielder, the wing-backs stretched the game with pace and width and, when this yielded a corner in the 55th minute, Hill headed in Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 delivery for his first goal in 20 months.</p> <p>Then came the breathtaking ending. Austin thought he had won it for QPR with a superb right-footed finish at the near post after a brilliant first touch to control Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 pull-back, only for Benteke to equalise five minutes later with a memorable free-kick that swerved in off a post after Hill had tripped Charles N\xe2\x80\x99Zogbia.</p>'
