b'<p>Charlie Austin looks out of the window at Queens Park Rangers\xe2\x80\x99 training ground and points across the empty pitches stretching into the distance as he tries to do justice to the scale of Michael Owen\xe2\x80\x99s Manor House Stables in Cheshire, where he recently paid a visit and was blown away by everything he took in. \xe2\x80\x9cOwen\xe2\x80\x99s gaff, it\xe2\x80\x99s just massive,\xe2\x80\x9d Austin says, puffing out his cheeks.</p> <p>An invitation from Owen was not something that Austin was going to turn down. The two share a mutual love of horse racing as well as a natural instinct for scoring goals and it takes little time in Austin\xe2\x80\x99s company to realise just how passionate he is about a sport that has turned into much more than a hobby for Owen and could do the same for the QPR striker in the future.</p>  <p> Related: Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend | Michael Butler and Nick Miller </p>   <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMichael invited me up there just into the new year and it was a real eye-opener,\xe2\x80\x9d Austin says. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think people realise how big a training yard is with the gallops. At somewhere like Lambourn [in Berkshire], everyone has got their yard plotted about and then they\xe2\x80\x99ve got gallops where they would have to go 500-1,000 metres up the road. But Michael Owen has everything on site, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking more than 100 acres. It was great to see it all and for me to be in the presence of a striker of his calibre.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It was Austin\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather, Alistair, who first got him interested in racing at the age of 15, around the time he was rejected by Reading for being too small. He remembers thinking how exciting it would be to own a racehorse one day, never imagining for one moment that a decade later he would be experiencing that thrill while playing in the Premier League.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPeople ask me what it\xe2\x80\x99s like scoring a goal,\xe2\x80\x9d says Austin. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, think of the best thing that could happen to you and times it by 10. Sometimes people say to me that I celebrate over the top, but when you score, the emotion \xe2\x80\xa6 you just can\xe2\x80\x99t control it. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same with owning a horse that wins.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Austin smiles as he thinks back to a \xe2\x80\x9cmad\xe2\x80\x9d fortnight across October and November last year, when Miss Sophierose, one of his horses, won at Worcester and everything clicked on the pitch. \xe2\x80\x9cWe played Aston Villa on the Monday, I got two and was man of the match, Sophie ran on the Wednesday and won, I scored against Chelsea on the Saturday \xe2\x80\x93 unfortunately we lost 2-1 \xe2\x80\x93 and then I played out of my skin in a 2-2 draw against Man City. On a personal note, that\xe2\x80\x99s as good as it gets,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, laughing.</p> <p>Together with Paul Fisher \xe2\x80\x93 his business partner \xe2\x80\x93 he has formed a syndicate called Excel Racing, which has six horses, and it is measure of how well connected Austin is in the industry that Tony McCoy was among the guests in his corporate box for Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Loftus Road last month.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve known Tony for about three years now,\xe2\x80\x9d Austin says. \xe2\x80\x9cI was friends with a load of flat jockeys. Obviously he\xe2\x80\x99s a jump jockey, our paths crossed and the following year I owned a racehorse, Interior Minister, and asked him if he\xe2\x80\x99d ride it for me \xe2\x80\x93 and the relationship went from there.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI knew Tony was an Arsenal fan, so I asked if he wanted to come to the Arsenal game at QPR. Fortunately for my family he was able to and he was in the box with them on what was the week before Cheltenham. For me, he\xe2\x80\x99s the greatest. People might look at him and think he\xe2\x80\x99s grumpy but when you\xe2\x80\x99re in his company, he\xe2\x80\x99s such a nice bloke.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The only disappointment was that McCoy went home happiest that night, despite the fact that Austin scored his 15th Premier League goal of the season. The 2-1 loss against Arsenal is one of nine defeats in QPR\xe2\x80\x99s last 10 league matches, leaving them four points adrift of safety ahead of two crucial away trips in the space of four days. QPR take on West Bromwich Albion, against whom Austin scored a hat-trick earlier in the season, on Saturday and travel to Aston Villa on Tuesday. \xe2\x80\x9cYou look at those two games and you think we need to get four to six points,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.</p> <p>Austin reflects on the season so far with mixed emotions. While there is no escaping his disappointment that QPR are at the wrong end of the table, the 25-year-old is entitled to take great satisfaction from being the fourth highest goalscorer in the Premier League in his first season in top flight football. Only Diego Costa, Harry Kane and Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero have scored more. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s quite surreal because I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have dreamed to be in the mix with people like that,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.</p>     The QPR striker Charlie Austin says he has England ambitions but accepts that Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s Harry Kane is ahead in the pecking order. Photograph: Martin Godwin for The Guardian    <p>Not that he wants to harp back to the days when he went to work with a trowel. While still in touch with the people who were there at the start of his remarkable journey from the Wessex League \xe2\x80\x93 Tom Killick, his manager at Poole Town, was also invited to the Arsenal game and went home chuffed to bits that Austin got him Santi Cazorla\xe2\x80\x99s shirt \xe2\x80\x93 there is a feeling that, after scoring 105 league goals in the last six seasons for Swindon Town, Burnley and QPR, all that talk about laying bricks is a little outdated.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI did an in-house interview with me and Les Ferdinand [QPR\xe2\x80\x99s director of football] and the question came up about me being a bricklayer,\xe2\x80\x9d Austin says. \xe2\x80\x9cLes interrupted, took the question and said: \xe2\x80\x98Look, I think we\xe2\x80\x99re past all that, he\xe2\x80\x99s done enough in football now to be known as a professional footballer.\xe2\x80\x99 So I would like to say I\xe2\x80\x99ve done enough to not forget about [the bricklaying], but to be recognised as a footballer.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The fact that Austin has been talked about for a possible England call-up is testament to just how far he has come. Playing for his country, Austin says, is his next goal and there is not the slightest trace of bitterness that Kane got a chance ahead of him in the recent internationals and made such an impact, scoring 79 seconds after coming on against Lithuania.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI saw the first goal, missed the next two and then flicked it on in the second half. I thought: \xe2\x80\x98He must come on now.\xe2\x80\x99 And do you know what, I was genuinely delighted he scored,\xe2\x80\x9d Austin says. \xe2\x80\x9c[Daniel] Sturridge, if he\xe2\x80\x99s fit, has to be called up, the same with Rooney and [Danny] Welbeck, so there is one slot. And one slot in my eyes \xe2\x80\x93 and this is not me trying to win sympathy \xe2\x80\x93 is Harry Kane. How could you not pick him?</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m having a hell of a season, yeah, great. But the guy has scored 29 goals. Eden Hazard has had a great season, don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong, but I voted for Harry Kane to win Young Player of the Year and the main award. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we can not give it to him. He\xe2\x80\x99s been the outstanding player.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Quick to tweet about Kane being on fire \xe2\x80\x93 complete with flame emojis \xe2\x80\x93 when the Tottenham Hotspur striker scored against Lithuania, Austin was taken to task on Twitter by Joey Barton, his QPR team-mate, the following morning for his \xe2\x80\x9chorrific\xe2\x80\x9d dress sense after he appeared on Soccer AM. Asked whether he has any response to Barton\xe2\x80\x99s comments, Austin replies: \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t actually. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just let sleeping dogs lie.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>After an inauspicious start, Austin and Barton have hit it off together. \xe2\x80\x9cMy first day, I came to the training ground within 45 minutes of signing and I was waiting for the security barrier to lift when he came out. I thought: \xe2\x80\x98That\xe2\x80\x99s Joey Barton.\xe2\x80\x99 He looked at me, just got in his car and drove off. I thought: \xe2\x80\x98Brilliant, here we go!\xe2\x80\x99 To be fair to him, he came in the next day, shook my hand and said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until he got home that he knew I had signed. The following day he invited me and Bianca, my wife-to-be, out to dinner and from then until now we\xe2\x80\x99ve been close mates.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Austin is optimistic that their friendship will continue in the Premier League with QPR next season, even if the odds are stacked against Chris Ramsey\xe2\x80\x99s side and their position appears perilous. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s belief. We\xe2\x80\x99re not coming into training all doom and gloom,\xe2\x80\x9d Austin says. \xe2\x80\x9cI really want to be part of something special here in the next eight games and I know, with the group of lads we\xe2\x80\x99ve got, there\xe2\x80\x99s a hell of a chance to stay in the Premier League.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
