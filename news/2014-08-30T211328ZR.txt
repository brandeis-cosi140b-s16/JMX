b'<p>Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez has accused Diego Costa of taunting S\xc3\xa9amus Coleman about his own goal during Everton\xe2\x80\x99s 6-3 defeat, saying Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s new striker needs \xe2\x80\x9cto understand the ethics\xe2\x80\x9d of the Premier League.</p> <p>Mart\xc3\xadnez was responding to comments from Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho that Everton\xe2\x80\x99s players had deliberately set out to \xe2\x80\x9cchase cards\xe2\x80\x9d to get his \xc2\xa332m signing in trouble on the day the former Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid player scored twice for his new club.</p> <p>The Everton manager said he was disappointed with Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s remarks and that Costa should be looking at his own behaviour before Chelsea complained about others.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think there are certain foreign players who, when they come to the Premier League, they need to understand the ethics,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a completely different culture and the last thing you want to be is disrespectful from a player to another player, even if he is on the opposing team. I am sure he will learn that very quickly. The last thing I would do myself is fall into a trap and be disrespectful that way.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>              <p>Mart\xc3\xadnez confirmed he was talking about Costa\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s own goal when Chelsea took a 3-1 lead and something was said that was provocative enough for Tim Howard to run out of his goal to confront the Spain forward. Costa had been booked for repeatedly tangling with Coleman earlier in the second half and Howard was also shown a yellow card.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat is something I am sure he [Costa] will learn quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d Mart\xc3\xadnez said, in response to questions about the own goal. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a real respect in the league and you can understand why the players weren\xe2\x80\x99t happy with that, the same way he was trying to win free-kicks with the way he was playing. It is going to take a little bit of time to understand this league is quite different and unique and it needs players to adapt to it rather than the league adapting to them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s version of events was quite different, alleging that Everton\xe2\x80\x99s players had deliberately targeted Costa to provoke him into a row. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like from this game, apart from our defending, was that some Everton players were trying to create problems for Diego,\xe2\x80\x9d the Chelsea manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think this is English football. It\xe2\x80\x99s also a contradiction for Everton because everything they normally do is good and positive. To be chasing yellow cards for a player of good behaviour, that is disappointing.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDiego is maybe the best player in the Premier League in the first three matches but he now has two yellow cards. One against Burnley when he didn\xe2\x80\x99t simulate and it was a clear penalty, and today everybody was chasing cards to try to get him in trouble.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Informed of those comments, Mart\xc3\xadnez said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m disappointed if a manager has won a game away from home and complained about our attitude.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
