That was a very important goal, after City had let their lead slip, and after City\xe2\x80\x99s draw with Burnley. After a pedestrian first half, that became a lot of fun.</p>     A close finish but Manchester City take the three points and celebrate a happy ending. Photograph: Andrew Yates/REUTERS  '
