b'Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Eliaquim Mangala to replace Vincent Kompany at QPR'


b'<p>Vincent Kompany\xe2\x80\x99s calf injury means Manchester City are likely to recall Eliaquim Mangala at centre-half for Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game at QPR, yet Manuel Pellegrini is continuing to stay positive despite his summer signing\xe2\x80\x99s uncertain form and the general criticism that has come the defence\xe2\x80\x99s way in recent weeks.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe had a bad result in the Champions League against CSKA Moscow but I think it is important to split the two competitions in which we are now playing,\xe2\x80\x9d the City manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Premier League is different. We are not in a bad position and we want to keep on picking up points.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI spoke with the players after the Champions League game and I still believe we can fight for the results we need to qualify but we do not have to think about that until after the international break. The Premier League picture is quite different.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI keep hearing questions about our defence but the league table shows we have the second-best defence along with Chelsea.\xe2\x80\x9d Southampton have conceded fewest goals this season with five; City, Chelsea and Swansea are next best with 10 goals against. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody says Chelsea defend very well but we have the same amount of goals conceded. So people can say what they want. I think my players have already demonstrated what they can do,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.</p> <p>Frank Lampard could be back to face QPR, though the midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s unexpected success in City colours has tended only to highlight the relative lack of impact made by Mangala, Fernando and others since arriving in the summer.</p>           Pellegrini says it is difficult for his side to recover between their Champions League and Premier League matches    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe had some restrictions when adding to our squad in summer. We could not have all the players we wanted so we tried to choose the ones we needed,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very happy with Mangala and I hope Mart\xc3\xadn Demichelis will be able to play in all the games when we might need him while Vincent is out. Demichelis had some criticism last year but he showed his worth by the end. I am sure Mangala will be the same \xe2\x80\x93 he is a good player and he is only just starting his career in England.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>For the same reasons, to do with financial fair play restrictions, Pellegrini does not expect to be adding to his squad in January. At least that is his feeling at this stage. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are two months and 10 or 12 games to go before we need to consider that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cFor now I think we have the correct squad for this season. At the moment we are not thinking of bringing anyone in.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini, however, does accept that City have suffered a loss of creativity through David Silva\xe2\x80\x99s injury and that Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 is not playing as consistently as last season, but he is unwilling to offer individuals as excuses. \xe2\x80\x9cAny team would miss a player of Silva\xe2\x80\x99s quality and Samir Nasri is just coming back from an injury too but I do not want to complain about one player more or less,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have the squad to deal with the four competitions.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cTour\xc3\xa9 will continue to be picked because I know how much he wants to play. Those arguing he could do with a break, a rest from the pressure because of the red card on Wednesday, do not know him as well as I do. I am talking with him every day, he has all my support and all my confidence. He wants to carry on playing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
