b'Manuel Pellegrini urges Manchester City to raise standard in Europe'


b'<p>Before rushing off for an audience with Juan Carlos I of Spain, who awaited in his office, Manuel Pellegrini was clear Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 and the rest of Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s star turns have to perform against CSKA Moscow in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s crucial Champions League encounter.</p> <p>So far, against Bayern Munich and Roma, Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s squad have lacked inspiration, with Tour\xc3\xa9 a particular disappointment. After losing 1-0 in Bavaria and drawing 1-1 with Roma at the Etihad Stadium, City have a point and are virtually playing sudden death in Group E.</p> <p>In those two outings Tour\xc3\xa9, David Silva, Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero, and Edin Dzeko were among those who disappointed. Asked how important it was the Ivorian and his other big guns fire, the manager said: \xe2\x80\x9cI always say when you want to win something you need a team that knows how to play and after that you need to have your best performance.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe have very important players and of course they must make the difference after the team plays in a way I like. Maybe against Bayern Munich we were a little bit unlucky, it was a game we play away. Against Roma we didn\xe2\x80\x99t play well, but I hope we start now in Champions League playing the way we have in the last two games in Premier League.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>This was reference to the 2-0 win at Aston Villa and Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s 4-1 victory over Tottenham Hotspur, which featured an Ag\xc3\xbcero quadruple.</p> <p>Yet here was a topsy-turvy affair that featured four penalties \xe2\x80\x93 one missed by the Argentinian \xe2\x80\x93 plus a Federico Fazio red card and ended up as a thumping from the champions while featuring sloppiness from them, as noted by Pellegrini. The chief culprit was Fernando, who gave away possession in threatening positions, a cardinal sin for all holding midfielders.</p> <p>His manager said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe must be balanced. Football is always different, if you are talking about the game we played [against Spurs], of course, it\xe2\x80\x99s not normal to concede or lose so many balls near our box. But if you talk to me about the [other] games we play, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose balls but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have clear chances to score.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe had excess of [clumsiness] with the ball at our foot because we lost three or four important balls near our box, that can finish with a goal. And in that way I am sure we will have the concentration we need first to not concede a goal [against CSKA]. And, after, to work the 90 minutes, and working as an offensive team as we always do, we are going to score goals.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The City executive have targeted the quarter-finals to show progression from last term\xe2\x80\x99s achievement of reaching the last 16. Yet despite this the Chilean refuses to bill the clash at the Arena Khimki, which will be empty due to CSKA\xe2\x80\x99s stadium ban for racist behaviour from fans, as the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s most important match.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree about that because when we started the game against Bayern Munich it was a very important game and against Roma also,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are talking just about Champions League. What we know is that we must win if we want to continue to have options to qualify for the next stage. But we are not just playing Champions League. If we don\xe2\x80\x99t win against Tottenham and Chelsea wins, eight points behind Chelsea is very difficult.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe are involved in four competitions, at the moment in three. After that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to start the FA Cup. I hope we are going to play in the same way as we did, especially against Aston Villa, not conceding one chance \xe2\x80\x93 well I think one chance in 90 minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ag\xc3\xbcero\xe2\x80\x99s four against Spurs featured two penalties plus two of the sharp finishes that have marked his time with City, and throughout his career. The striker is now the club\xe2\x80\x99s highest Premier League scorer on 61 goals, passing Carlos Tevez\xe2\x80\x99s record of 58. If Ag\xc3\xbcero continues in similar vein against Leonid Slutsky\xe2\x80\x99s team in Moscow they could be blown away.</p> <p>Joe Hart, whose fine save at 2-1 from a Roberto Soldado penalty was pivotal, offered an intriguing revelation regarding Ag\xc3\xbcero: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think he will be unhappy with me saying it \xe2\x80\x93 that some days in training he is useless. That is just down to him. He\xe2\x80\x99s a big-match player. Finishing-wise he is the best.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>While Frank Lampard will not travel due to the muscle injury suffered against Spurs, City badly need Ag\xc3\xbcero and his team-mates to prove, again, how good they are in Moscow.</p> <p>Man of the match Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero (Manchester City)</p>'
