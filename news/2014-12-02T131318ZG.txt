b'Gr\xc3\xaamio\xe2\x80\x99s ugly failure completes miserable year for Luiz Felipe Scolari | Conrad Leach'


b'<p>No matter how much most of the Brazilian public would like it, Luiz Felipe Scolari will not go away. More than five months after leading Brazil to the joint-worst defeat in their history, he is upsetting a lot of people all over again.</p> <p>Scolari resigned as manager of the Sele\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o a week after the 7-1 humiliation against Germany in the World Cup semi-finals but he was not out of the game for long. At a time when his friends were rapidly disappearing \xe2\x80\x93 one opinion poll had his approval rating fall from 68% before the World Cup to, perhaps unsurprisingly, 20% after their elimination \xe2\x80\x93 one old mate gave him a call. Fabio Koff, the president of Gr\xc3\xaamio, asked him back to the club where he made his name. The club were in mid-table, with five wins after 12 games, and needed a lift. Many may have thought the time was not right for Scolari to return to football but in late July, barely three weeks after the Germany game, return he did.</p> <p>Despite the hurried nature of his appointment there was some sense behind Scolari\xe2\x80\x99s move. It was with Gr\xc3\xaamio, in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, where he came to wider attention in 1995, by winning the Copa Libertadores. Those roots \xe2\x80\x93 southerners like Scolari are called gauchos \xe2\x80\x93 have landed him in trouble now.</p> <p>Scolari felt the need to prove himself all over again, post-World Cup. How better to do it than by qualifying for the tournament that made his name? At times it seemed as if he was working his magic: the Tricolor went on a run of 11 games with only one defeat. They did not concede a goal in the last eight games of that run and gave themselves a chance of finishing in the top four, which guarantees qualification for the Libertadores.</p> <p>Scolari\xe2\x80\x99s team maintained their momentum in the league up until the middle of last month. On his 66th birthday Scolari had the best possible present, a 4-1 win over their local rivals, Internacional, but then the wheels fell off.</p> <p>At home against the league leaders, Cruzeiro, on 20 November Gr\xc3\xaamio lost 2-1 and Scolari\xe2\x80\x99s assistant, Fl\xc3\xa1vio Murtosa, was sent off near the end for allegedly calling the referee \xe2\x80\x9ca son of a bitch\xe2\x80\x9d. Scolari rounded on the Brazilian FA, the CBF, for sending the same fourth official to their games time after time. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t like him, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like us. We can\xe2\x80\x99t even look at him,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>With that defeat the game in S\xc3\xa3o Paulo against Corinthians assumed even greater importance. Gr\xc3\xaamio lost 1-0, conceding the goal late in the second half which all but scuppered their Libertadores hopes. Scolari, having found his voice after the Cruzeiro game, then really hit his stride. He accused the referee of not giving what he thought was a clear penalty and then claimed the CBF did not want teams like his in the Libertadores.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe [Libertadores] teams have already been chosen,\xe2\x80\x9d Scolari said, in defeat. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not interesting, as a business, for those who run our football to have two teams from Minas [Gerais, a state] and two from Rio Grande do Sul, in the Libertadores.\xe2\x80\x9d Maybe Scolari\xe2\x80\x99s words were a self-fulfilling prophecy. Gr\xc3\xaamio lost 1-0 on Sunday night to Bahia and, with one game left in the league, cannot now qualify for the Libertadores.</p> <p>The Superior Tribunal de Justi\xc3\xa7a Desportiva (STJD) has opened investigations into what he said and he could be banned for six games. Scolari has little faith in the STJD. Corinthians were investigated over the possible ineligibility of a player, Petros. Scolari said before last week\xe2\x80\x99s decision: \xe2\x80\x9cCorinthians won\xe2\x80\x99t lose four points, they will win four points. It\xe2\x80\x99s all sewn up.\xe2\x80\x9d Lo and behold, Corinthians were not docked any points.</p> <p>He was right on that occasion but Scolari has seen conspiracies wherever he has gone in his much-travelled life: at Chelsea he felt the top players were pushing for him to get the sack and at Palmeiras in 2012 he thought there was a CBF conspiracy to get them relegated. After the 7-1 he claimed a \xe2\x80\x9cpower failure\xe2\x80\x9d among his players was the cause of that defeat.</p> <p>Scolari has found little sympathy over his comments. Radio Bandeirantes, a national radio station, said: \xe2\x80\x9cImagine if the CBF did like gauchos. They would get one to manage the national team instead of Dunga, Mano Menezes or Felip\xc3\xa3o\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 the joke being that all three have managed Brazil and are gauchos.</p> <p>Juca Kfouri, the respected Brazilian football columnist, put it like this: \xe2\x80\x9cFelip\xc3\xa3o was doing well at Gr\xc3\xaamio until the Cruzeiro game. All that plus the whining that followed \xe2\x80\x93 not to mention the pornographic 7-1 \xe2\x80\x93 make 2014 one of those years he will want to erase from his life.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
