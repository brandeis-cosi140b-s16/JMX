b'Manuel Pellegrini: Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s European exertions give Manchester City edge'


b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini believes Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s late return in the early hours of Friday morning from Turkey after being knocked out of the Europa League by Besiktas will give Manchester City an \xe2\x80\x9cadvantage\xe2\x80\x9d at Anfield in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s noon kick-off.</p> <p>Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s defeat on penalties meant Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 side had to endure the energy-sapping demand of extra-time before the mentally draining experience of being eliminated on spot-kicks.</p> <p>To compound all this Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s flight back from Istanbul was delayed by 90 minutes so they landed back at John Lennon Airport at 4.30am on Friday. In comparison City will have had four full days to recover after losing to Barcelona evening in the Champions League on Tuesday.</p> <p>Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cI think that of course it is an advantage, not a decisive one because I always think the decisive thing is the performance on the day of the game. But I have played in the Europa League and when you arrive on Friday it is not the best way to prepare for a game on Sunday \xe2\x80\x93 but that is the rules. They are playing Europa League. Maybe another time we prepare worse for the game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini believes having to play in the Europa League on a Thursday and the Premier League on Sunday is difficult. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot prepare the game because you finish on Thursday night and you must play on Sunday, the players need at least 48 hours to recover,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is an advantage for the other team but it is not a decisive one. If we think we are going to win that game because Liverpool arrive late, that is not the reason. We must play very good because they also have a strong squad. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they will play the same starting 11 as yesterday night.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>City can close the gap in the Premier League title race to two points as Chelsea play Tottenham Hotspur in the Capital One Cup final on Sunday. The City manager says victory is vital to keep the pressure on the leaders. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course it is important, more than psychologically it is important mathematically,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pellegrini. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to have three points more, we are going to go two points behind Chelsea because they do not play the next game. Last season, I remember we were nine points behind Chelsea with three games in hand, but we were nine points behind, and then you have the pressure to win those three games.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very important to beat Liverpool because they are a strong team and [have] a difficult stadium. And to continue winning in the Premier League in the way we did in the last two games \xe2\x80\x93 we won 4-1 and 5-0 against Stoke and Newcastle \xe2\x80\x93 and continue fighting until the end to retain the title because we have to play 36 points more, that is a lot of points and as soon as we close the gap it is better for us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
