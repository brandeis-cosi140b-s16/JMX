b'A-League semi-final: Melbourne Victory v Melbourne City \xe2\x80\x93 what to look out for | Jack Kerr'


b'City are a terrible advertisement for Etihad <p>The form book is usually thrown out of the window when the Melbourne derby is played at the shared AAMI Park, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a different story at Etihad, where Friday night\xe2\x80\x99s semi-final takes place \xe2\x80\x93 and where City have proven to be quite terrible. The team from the northern suburbs (that\xe2\x80\x99s the red half of Melbourne\xe2\x80\x99s geopolitical divide) are as bad at Victory\xe2\x80\x99s home-away-from-home as they are on the road \xe2\x80\x93 and this is not a team that has taken to intercity travel (except, interestingly, to play Sydney FC).</p> <p>In their seven visits to the Docklands stadium, City have won just once. That was Ange Postecoglou\xe2\x80\x99s first outing at the helm of Victory. The home side produced flashes of hypnotic football that night, but looked very much like a team still getting their head around his patterns of play.</p> <p>The darkest hour comes before the dawn, and Victory are since unbeaten in derbies at the venue. But it has only been under the tutelage of Kevin Muscat, who has refined and adapted the teachings of his predecessor, that Victory have been able to humiliate City there.</p> Muscat destroys City <p>Kevin Muscat\xe2\x80\x99s reign of terror over Melbourne City really began with a single tackle. It hospitalised a speedy and creative young player called Adrian Zahra and cemented the former Socceroo\xe2\x80\x99s villainous reputation.</p> <p>The suspension which followed meant it was the last tackle he would ever make in the A-League. He was, however, still eligible to play in the Asian Champions League. The psychologist who got the punchy Barry Hall back on track at the Sydney Swans told me at the time that Muscat shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be allowed to play until someone had assessed if he was a danger to others.</p> <p>Yet for City, it\xe2\x80\x99s off the pitch that Muscat has blossomed into their chief tormentor. Sure, Muscat hasn\xe2\x80\x99t won every game against his not-so-noisy neighbours. But take City to Etihad Stadium, the site of that attack on Zahra, and Muscat\xe2\x80\x99s Victory destroy them. A 5-2 desecration at the start of the season; a 3-0 decimation when the sides meet there again in February.</p> <p>City beat Muscat\xe2\x80\x99s side by an even bigger margin last season, but only just got over the line in the other derby this season. Another big loss this week at Etihad, and it\xe2\x80\x99s they who might need to talk with someone.</p> Goals galore for Victory <p>Gun for hire Besart Berisha has proved to be worth every cent Victory paid to get him there. He finished the home-and-away season equal second on the goal scorers\xe2\x80\x99 table, and delivered more than enough goals for his team to lift the Premiers\xe2\x80\x99 Plate. This is far from a one-man show, however. Each of Victory\xe2\x80\x99s attacking quintet have contributed. The ageing Archie Thomson even made it to double figures, despite limited game time. For goals-per-minute, he\xe2\x80\x99s been nearly twice as efficient as Berisha this season.</p> <p>By comparison, City\xe2\x80\x99s leading light is midfielder Aaron Mooy, with seven goals. Striker David Williams and EPL import Robert Koren can count their tally on one hand, and still have a couple of fingers left over. Defensive midfielder Erik Paartalu has scored as many. Yet around 20 players have found the net for City all up, a number significantly higher than Victory\xe2\x80\x99s tally of goal scorers.</p> Mooy bien <p>Mooy is the gaffer tape holding together this City outfit. He is the only player in the league to complete over 1,000 passes, and no one at any club comes close to his tally of 90 chances created in front of goal. Next on that list are Gui Finkler and Fahid Ben Khalfallah, with 58 and 43 respectively.</p> <p>But while Mooy has eight assists to his name (meaning he has been involved in almost half of his team\xe2\x80\x99s goals), the Victory duo top the league with nine each. Archie Thompson, meanwhile, has four assists from 17 chances created. There\xe2\x80\x99s a pattern in there, and it looks ugly for City.</p> <p>Mooy is also one of just two City players to score a goal from outside the box (excluding the long-departed David Villa). And in both cases, it is just a single goal. Since mid-October. That\xe2\x80\x99s one every 13 matches. Victory have eight for the season. If there\xe2\x80\x99s one crucial phrase every City fan needs to know, it\xe2\x80\x99s this: get it in the bloody mixer!</p> Not pretty, City (but miracles can yet happen) <p>Melbourne City are one win away from a debut A-League grand final. They are two wins away from the championship. Some might have expected that kind of miracle when Manchester City took over the club last January, but not after the regular season they delivered.</p> <p>They\xe2\x80\x99ve been an improvement on recent years, but if not for some creative book keeping in the west, the team still would have finished in the bottom half of the table. And this is a squad that had Villa on their books for a third of the season, plus Koren, Damien Duff (ex-Chelsea) and former Socceroo hero Josh Kennedy. Victory\xe2\x80\x99s lower profile international signings \xe2\x80\x93 starting with Ben Khalfallah \xe2\x80\x93 have had a much bigger impact.</p> <p>There have been promising moments for City \xe2\x80\x93 Koren\xe2\x80\x99s arrival; the crowds that Villa pulled (it was like being at a real match); Mooy making a name for himself. Overall though, it\xe2\x80\x99s been hard to get overly excited by the way they have performed.</p> <p>Should they conquer their Etihad jitters, it would be hard to think of a grand finalist in the short history of the competition who was less deserving of being there. Yet if they were to end up playing the grand final in Sydney, that\xe2\x80\x99s the one team they\xe2\x80\x99ve actually been able to regularly beat away from home. Miracles can happen. Still.</p>'
