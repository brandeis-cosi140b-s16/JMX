b'The Fiver | That damn-fool FA commission!'


b'TIME TO FORGIVE AND FORGET? NAH <p>The last time Manchester United competed in the second round of Tin Pot, the annual cup competition run by the Football League, they were stuffed 3-0 by York City in 1995. Now that was some result. United were the dominant team in the land, the best side in the country by a mile, on their way to becoming champions of England and the first-ever winners of a second Double. An XI featuring David Beckham, Lee Sharpe, Brian McClair, Ryan Giggs, Paul Parker, Denis Irwin, Gary Pallister and Phil Neville were thrashed on their own ground by a relegation-haunted rabble from the third tier, one of the great humiliations. And York City was an actual football club, a morally legitimate concern built from scratch with determination, love and patience, one which hadn\xe2\x80\x99t kidnapped the still-twitching carcass of another entity without a single thought for tradition or other people\xe2\x80\x99s feelings simply to save themselves a few years\xe2\x80\x99 effort and a bit of hard work.</p> <p>Compare and contrast to United\xe2\x80\x99s next appearance in the second round of Tin Pot, 19 years on, last night. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody can talk about our birth or our existence in the Football League from now on,\xe2\x80\x9d chirruped Karl Robinson, manager of the M***** K***** D*** after his third-tier side pummelled United 4-0. Ah, but they can. Thing is, had the ambitious footballing souls of Milton Keynes started at the bottom of England\xe2\x80\x99s democratic football pyramid like everyone else, even Manchester United, and victory over one of the most famous clubs in the world was the glorious culmination of a Homeric journey, it would be time to celebrate one of sport\xe2\x80\x99s most romantic fairytales. After all, nobody begrudged one-time Isthmian League strugglers Wimbledon their giant-killing victory over Liverpool in the 1988 FA Cup final, to pull one random example out of the ether. But they didn\xe2\x80\x99t, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve well and truly put ourselves on the map,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted Robinson, another false claim as it happens, since Ordnance Survey have yet to add the legend HERE BE MONSTERS anywhere on the sheet featuring northern Buckinghamshire.</p> <p>But never mind that shower, for if those involved don\xe2\x80\x99t see it now, they never will. Back to football, and what does this result mean for Manchester United? After all, last night\xe2\x80\x99s side might have been missing one or two big names, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly second string, featuring as it did David de Gea, Jonny Evans, Shinji Kagawa, Javier Hern\xc3\xa1ndez, Danny Welbeck, Adnan Januzaj and Anderso \xe2\x80\xa6 well, you get the point. Anyway, according to Louis van Gaal, the result means nothing. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not shocked,\xe2\x80\x9d he shrugged. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult when you start as manager in the Premier League with a home match loss and after that a draw and then lose a cup match, then for the fans it is very difficult to believe in the philosophy of Louis van Gaal. But you have to do that, because I am here to build a new team, and a new team is not built in one month.\xe2\x80\x9d A lesson that applies equally to clubs, come to think about it. If only Louis was around 10 years ago to knock some sense into that damn-fool FA commission!</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Scott Murray from 7.45pm BST for MBM coverage of Arsenal 2-1 Besiktas (agg: 2-1) in Big Cup play-off second leg.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAt this level we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stretch to Premier League-style luxury.

It\xe2\x80\x99s cake, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? He wanted a cake. Bakers in and around Manchester have never had it so good\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Matt Atkinson.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to join 1,056 other toast-loving pedants in pointing out that toast landing marmalade-side-down isn\xe2\x80\x99t inevitable (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver), just probable. In 2006, Robert Matthews of Aston University won an Ig Nobel Prize for showing that buttered toast falling from a table will land soggy-side down 62% of the time. While some condiment-focused pedant may wish to take issue with me on this point, I doubt that the addition of marmalade can boost that figure to 100%. Although I accept that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the basic point that Nasty Leeds appear to be in a jam\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Matthew Taylor (and no other toast-loving pedants).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWas it really necessary to state that the cup of tea in the \xe2\x80\x98life expectancy of a custard cream\xe2\x80\x99 had to be \xe2\x80\x98freshly made\xe2\x80\x99 (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver)? Surely even vending machine tea would cause the demise of a custard cream?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Paul Dixon.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: Daniel Rice and Fiver prizes (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters). I won a copy of Football Manager last year and flogged it to a bloke at work.
