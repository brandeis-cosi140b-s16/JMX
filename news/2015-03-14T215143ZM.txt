b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini refused to concede the title to Chelsea after Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s 1-0 defeat at Burnley cost his side more ground at the top of the Premier League table, but his demeanour suggested he knows some sort of miracle will be necessary in Barcelona on Wednesday to salvage his side\xe2\x80\x99s season.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEvery point we drop makes it more difficult to come back at Chelsea and win the league, all we can do from here is try our best to win the next game,\xe2\x80\x9d the City manager said.</p> <p>Easier said than done, when City have found Barcelona hard to live with in recent seasons and travel to Spain having to overcome a 2-1 deficit from the first leg. Should City exit Europe this week Pellegrini may not survive successive setbacks against by Burnley and Barcelona. The club owners are known to require progress, evidence is mounting that City are actually going backwards, and Pellegrini appears to know it.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFootball is not all about money,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in response to a question about the financial gulf between Burnley and City. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is an important thing but we know any team can beat another in the Premier League. We needed to make more chances against Burnley, because they only made one and it won them the game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>City were so bereft of ideas or enthusiasm Pellegrini was asked if he felt it had been an acceptable performance. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it was a normal performance,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNot one of our best, the result indicates that. We tried to give everything but we did not have a good day. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t play well enough and we need to improve. I will not give up on the title until it is mathematically impossible, but this result makes winning more difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea could open an eight-point gap and still have a game in hand if they beat Southampton at home on Sunday, and Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho letting an advantage like that slip is about as likely as Barcelona rolling over at the Camp Nou.</p> <p>Pellegrini added: \xe2\x80\x9cThe chances for the title are now far, but we must continue fighting for our position.\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini said his side were \xe2\x80\x9cvery unlucky\xe2\x80\x9d, but admitted something was wrong with his team.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYes, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe results are wrong, because we are not winning the games we normally do.\xe2\x80\x9d Asked why that was the case, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cBecause we don\xe2\x80\x99t score.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>At the opposite end of the table, the three points represent a lifeline for Burnley, who remain in the bottom three but are in better form than some of the teams just above the relegation zone. Sunderland look particularly vulnerable after Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s 0-4 home thrashing by rejuvenated Aston Villa and are just one point above Burnley after George Boyd\xe2\x80\x99s sweetly struck second-half goal secured a valuable win.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if it was the best goal of my career but I think it might be the most important.\xe2\x80\x9d Boyd said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cTaking four points off the champions [Burnley drew at the Etihad in December] is massive for us. Teams just above us are not in the same sort of form and that gives us confidence. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone gave us a chance against City today except the players in the Burnley dressing room. We worked hard and got in their faces again, and it seems to work.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>City had a strong penalty claim turned away when Ben Mee appeared to bring down Pablo Zabaleta in the final minutes. Sean Dyche said he had not seen the incident but the Burnley manager added: \xe2\x80\x9cIf we\xe2\x80\x99ve got that one then fair play, we haven\xe2\x80\x99t always had the big decisions go our way.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Dyche praised his side\xe2\x80\x99s display but emphasised the need to keep feet on the ground. \xe2\x80\x9cToday we managed to get the margins to go our way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is great belief in what we do here and you can see that.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt still is a challenge, we enjoy today of course, to bring a big result is fantastic for everyone, but we know there\xe2\x80\x99s a long way to go.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
