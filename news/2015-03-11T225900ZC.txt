b'Chelsea 2-2 PSG: how the players in French side\xe2\x80\x99s away-goals win rated'


b'Chelsea <p>Thibaut Courtois 6 Made some good saves late on and in extra-time, but could do little as one header fizzed past him and the other sailed over him and in</p> <p>Branislav Ivanovic 6 His goal in Paris had given Chelsea the edge, but keeping a watchful eye on raids from Matuidi and Cavani on his flank kept him busy here</p> <p>Gary Cahill 6 Mourinho gave him the nod over Zouma and while he was stretched at times, his goal to break the deadlock looked like it would be enough</p> <p>John Terry 6 Like his team he struggled to last the pace against the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 10 men and his usual authority was missing on the vital PSG set pieces</p> <p>C\xc3\xa9sar Azpilicueta 6 Has become such a reassuring presence at left-back that Ashley Cole is now forgotten, but could use some of his predecessor\xe2\x80\x99s pace</p> <p>Nemanja Matic 6 Fresh due to his domestic suspension, but struggled to keep up with the pace of the game and made way for Zouma in the latter stages</p> <p>Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas 6 Is he running out of gas in his first season back in England? Couldn\xe2\x80\x99t cope with the energy of Matuidi, Verratti and Motta in the centre</p> <p>Ramires 6 Is clearly a favourite of Mourinho for his industry but could not wrest control from PSG\xe2\x80\x99s midfield, even against 10 men, and was booked</p> <p>Oscar 5 Was possibly as culpable in the red card incident as Ibrahimovic, and after being booked was replaced by Willian at half-time</p> <p>Eden Hazard 6 Bright and energetic early on \xe2\x80\x93 he looked to have the beating of Marquinhos, but could not exert his influence fully even with an extra man</p> <p>Diego Costa 6 Not the shy, retiring type, is he? Early row with David Luiz carried on all game, should have had a penalty but he plays the game on the edge</p> <p>Substitutes: Willian (for Oscar, h-t); Zouma (for Matic, 84); Drogba (for Ramires, 91) Not used Cech, Filipe Lu\xc3\xads, R\xc3\xa9my, Cuadrado</p> <p> </p> PSG <p>Salvatore Sirigu 7 It was no great surprise when PSG eventually conceded from a set piece but the Italian held firm under pressure and some late high balls</p> <p>Marquinhos 6 The youngest member of an all-Brazilian back four, and it showed at times as he struggled to keep tabs on Hazard and Costa</p> <p>David Luiz 7 The Brazilian was desperate to impress on his return to Stamford Bridge and his powerful headed equaliser certainly did just that</p> <p>Thiago Silva 8 The captain was distraught when he gave away a needless extra-time penalty, but atoned and then some with towering header to decide it</p> <p>Maxwell 7 The experienced Brazilian kept a calm head while many of his team-mates didn\xe2\x80\x99t and intelligent positioning helped PSG stay in the game</p> <p>Blaise Matuidi 7 An irrepressible bundle of energy from box-to-box, he ran himself into the ground long before he was substituted late in normal time</p> <p>Thiago Motta 7 Lucky to escape an early booking for a blatant bodycheck on F\xc3\xa0bregas and while he was booked in the end it was only after a fine battling display</p> <p>Marco Verratti 7 The combative little Italian showed why he is a favourite at his club with a scrapping display, literally at times as he took the fight to Chelsea</p> <p>Edinson Cavani 7 Perhaps should have given a penalty away for clumsy tackle on Costa, missed a superb chance when he hit the inside of a post but kept going</p> <p>Zlatan Ibrahimovic 5 The myth has it that he never plays well against English clubs, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the chance here after his tackle on Oscar. Red card looked harsh</p> <p>Javier Pastore 6 Preferred to Lavezzi but his role changed after the sending-off. Despite that he could have done better with a couple of half-chances to win it</p> <p>Substitutes: Lavezzi (for Matuidi, 81); Rabiot (for Verratti, 82); Van der Weil (for Pastore,118) Not used Douchez, Camara, Bahebeck, Digne</p> <p>Referee: B Kuipers (Neth)</p>'
