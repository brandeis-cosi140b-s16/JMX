b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho says Arsenal are rivals to Chelsea for Premier League title'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho considers Arsenal to be rivals in a three-way title race, but only if they retain the form demonstrated against West Ham United last Saturday rather than that exposed in the recent defeat to Monaco in the Champions League.</p> <p>Chelsea passed up a chance to move eight points clear of Manchester City, and nine ahead of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s side, by drawing 1-1 with Southampton after Dusan Tadic\xe2\x80\x99s disputed penalty cancelled out Diego Costa\xe2\x80\x99s first goal in two months. Arsenal have won eight of their previous nine league games and host Chelsea on 26 April, with Mourinho stressing the title race is far from over.</p>  <p> Related: Chelsea 1-1 Southampton | Premier League match report </p>   <p>Asked if he considered teams other than Manchester City to be in contention for the title, the Chelsea manager said: \xe2\x80\x9cOf course [Arsenal are] as they are seven points behind, even if they have one less match to play than Chelsea. I keep thinking our opposition is better than theirs [over the run-in], but I think both teams are in the race.\xe2\x80\x9d Whether Arsenal might represent a greater threat than City, given their recent surge of form, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cWhich momentum? The 3-1 against Monaco or the 3-0 against West Ham? It depends on the momentum.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho initially suggested he would not comment upon Mike Dean\xe2\x80\x99s decision to award Southampton a penalty, the official showing Nemanja Matic a yellow card for what he considered to be a foul on Sadio Man\xc3\xa9. The clearer contact actually appeared to be Branislav Ivanovic\xe2\x80\x99s push on the Southampton player. Yet the manager revisited the incident when explaining his subsequent decision to substitute Matic, the Serb having escaped a second yellow card for a trip on the same player in the opening exchanges of the second period.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen that penalty is given you have to believe that the second yellow could come,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWith fast players like Man\xc3\xa9 coming out of midfield, driving the ball, that could happen. If you remember Ramires\xe2\x80\x99s red card against Aston Villa last season, obviously you are afraid of it.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI went to Sky and they told me that their pundits said it was a penalty. I went to the BBC and they said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a penalty. I went to the radio and they said it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. Now I come here and I think I understand you\xe2\x80\x99re saying it\xe2\x80\x99s not a penalty. There are different perspectives. But what is important is Mr Mike Dean, and his decision was a penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Southampton manager, Ronald Koeman, said: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the second half there was a foul [Matic on Man\xc3\xa9] that maybe could be a yellow card, which would have been his second one. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not supporting referees showing eight, nine, 10 yellows every game. You need to be straight in every situation, and that\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult. The referee did a great job today.\xe2\x80\x9dThe home side\xe2\x80\x99s own appeal for a spot-kick, when Tadic clipped Ivanovic, was waved away. Asked if he thought his side would benefit from a penalty award again this season, Mourinho said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a question. It\xe2\x80\x99s a question. It\xe2\x80\x99s a question.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
