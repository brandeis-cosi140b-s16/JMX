b'Football transfer rumours: Kevin De Bruyne to join Manchester United?'


b'<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s been a whirlwind few months for the ex-Chelsea misfit Kevin De Bruyne. From scoring twice against the all-conquering Bayern Munich to giving his Wolfsburg side a glimmer of hope in the Bundesliga title race to swearing at ballboys for not throwing him back the ball quick enough, the 23-year-old who still looks like he could get half-fare on the bus has become big news since his move to Germany last year.</p> <p>But things weren\xe2\x80\x99t always as rosy as the Belgium midfield star\xe2\x80\x99s cheeks. No, the Mill remembers vividly those dark days at the start of last season when De Bruyne was hauled by Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho after just an hour of the visit to Old Trafford. He ended up playing just five more minutes in the Premier League before the Special One decided he\xe2\x80\x99d seen enough.</p> <p>Well, Jos\xc3\xa9, remember that (milky bar) kid you wrote off? He\xe2\x80\x99s only rated as the best midfielder in Germany these days, according to Bild anyway.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe choice to join Chelsea was not the best. Being at Chelsea is like being in a different world,\xe2\x80\x9d De Bruyne mused in a lengthy feature with the newspaper yesterday. \xe2\x80\x9cMourinho didn\xe2\x80\x99t explain to me why I was not playing. Maybe things would have been different if Chelsea had paid \xe2\x82\xac45m for me, rather than \xe2\x82\xac8m. A higher transfer fee maybe would have afforded me greater consideration.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ah, bless his cotton socks. Anyway, the purveyors of Germany\xe2\x80\x99s finest transfer tittle tattle have been doing their best to stir the pot over the last month, suggesting on several occasions that Bayern have been sniffing around but also that Louis van Gaal just so happens to be a \xe2\x80\x9chuge fan\xe2\x80\x9d of his Low Countries compatriot. Manchester United could certainly use some of De Bruyne\xe2\x80\x99s guile in central midfield and perhaps it could even free up Wayne Rooney to do what he does best, which apparently is not quite happening at the moment.</p> <p>There could be trouble brewing at the other end of the Old Trafford pitch as well, with Spanish newspaper AS suggesting that David de Gea\xe2\x80\x99s future at Manchester United is far from certain. Despite the assurances of everyone\xe2\x80\x99s favourite nightclub DJ-turned-superagent Jorge Mendes that his client will be signing a new contract imminently, the Spanish shot-stopper is reported to have not spoken to his manager \xe2\x80\x9cfor months\xe2\x80\x9d, while Mendes is in \xe2\x80\x9cconstant contact\xe2\x80\x9d with Real Madrid. What, even in the bath? What about when he\xe2\x80\x99s asleep? Or perhaps we\xe2\x80\x99re taking this a bit too seriously?</p> <p>Anyway, fresh from Monaco\xe2\x80\x99s win over Arsenal at the Emirates on Wednesday, Tottenham are said to be eyeing up the Ligue 1 side\xe2\x80\x99s defender Aymen Abdennour to bolster their backline next season. The Tunisia star clearly fancies life in north London anyway. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? Right now I have to be patient,\xe2\x80\x9d he told someone. \xe2\x80\x9cThings will happen naturally. I am not going to put any pressure on myself because I am very happy at Monaco.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Elsewhere, Everton have been told they will have to stump up \xc2\xa37m to land Aaron Lennon from Spurs on a permanent deal. Almost a decade on from his exciting cameos at the 2006 World Cup, the still-only-27-year-old-flyer is eyeing up an England recall and reckons Merseyside might be just the place to help him achieve his dream. Now wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that be lovely for the little fella?</p>'
