b'<p>Chelsea have signed the QPR striker Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my on a four-year deal. Chelsea triggered a \xc2\xa310.5m release clause in his contract on Saturday lunchtime and he was subsequently left out of their squad to face Sunderland.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI feel very happy and very proud. When I heard Chelsea wanted to sign me I said \xe2\x80\x98let\xe2\x80\x99s go\xe2\x80\x99 straight away because they are one of the best clubs in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d said R\xc3\xa9my. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember the amazing atmosphere at Stamford Bridge when I played there for Marseille and I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to play for the first time in front of my new fans.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>There were reports that Arsenal were also interested in signing the striker but decided not to pursue the deal any further.</p> <p>R\xc3\xa9my joined QPR from Marseille in January 2013, scoring six goals in 14 games, as Rangers were relegated from the Premier League. He spent the 2013-14 campaign on loan at Newcastle United, where he scored 14 goals.</p> <p>He played in QPR\xe2\x80\x99s first two league games this season but not in their Capital One Cup defeat by Burton Albion, so remains eligible to play for Chelsea in all competitions. A deal to Liverpool earlier this summer fell through after it was thought that R\xc3\xa9my failed a medical.</p>'
