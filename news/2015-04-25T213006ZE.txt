b'Eden Hazard will cost \xc2\xa3100m each leg, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho warns Real Madrid'


b'<p>It took Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho a couple of attempts to settle upon a package whose value could, hypothetically, tempt Chelsea into negotiating with Real Madrid for Eden Hazard. \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa3100m each leg, because he\xe2\x80\x99s very young,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho. Whether or not this was an advance on the \xc2\xa3100m \xe2\x80\x9cplus one of their best three players\xe2\x80\x9d suggested a few moments previously is moot, but the point was clear enough.</p> <p>Executives from Spain\xe2\x80\x99s top two clubs are not known for making casual asides, so when Zinedine Zidane \xe2\x80\x93 who now manages Real\xe2\x80\x99s B team, Castilla \xe2\x80\x93 dropped his admiration for Hazard into an interview there was cause to wonder whether he was the advance party for a summer of attempts to unsettle the player.</p> <p>Hazard, who will continue his record of starting every Premier League game this season when Chelsea play Arsenal on Sunday, signed a new contract in February and Mourinho said there was no chance that his former club had been in touch asking to break it. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they want him I think I would be the first one to know because my relationship with the president and with the CEO doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give space for something to happen behind me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cI trust them completely. If they want him, they get on the telephone and they call me to tell me they want him. It\xe2\x80\x99s the way I feel about president [Florentino] P\xc3\xa9rez and S\xc3\xa1nchez [Real\xe2\x80\x99s director general, Jos\xc3\xa9 \xc3\x81ngel].\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>There seems little prospect of a deal taking place and Mourinho suggested that Hazard is better suited to Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s current mode of operation than a policy such as the gal\xc3\xa1ctico approach that has variously been a blessing and a curse in Madrid. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not the kind of group that is looking for somebody to be special, for somebody to be more than the others,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not our culture. I think [Hazard] doesn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to that culture too. He knows that he\xe2\x80\x99s a special player for us and that we need him to be decisive, but he\xe2\x80\x99s such a normal boy that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t belong to that glamour. He wants to be a special player and a normal person. In football [there is] a lot the culture now of being a special player and a special person. This is not him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Hazard may have to take heightened responsibility for Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s incursions\xc2\xa0at the\xc2\xa0Emirates Stadium, with Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my and Diego Costa unlikely to be available and Mourinho considering a call-up for the 17-year-old striker Dominic Solanke. His level of application has been constant despite a relatively stodgy spring from his team, and Mourinho outlined the ways in which he sets an example to those around him.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn my career I have lost matches because of my best players,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are players that gave me so many [victories], but I lost matches because of them. Eden is in a state of mind, and a tactical approach, where this season we have won matches because of him and have not lost because of him. He is a talented player that understands what the team needs.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a fantastic boy. A golden boy. The way he behaves, the way he respects people, even the way he respects opponents. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is one opponent who can say: \xe2\x80\x98He insulted me, he made fun of me, he played with his shoulder when he was winning 5-0, he did 20 bicycles [lollipops] in front of me\xe2\x80\x99. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cheat, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t dive. Nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Hazard is the favourite to be named PFA Player of the Year on Sunday evening but Mourinho says success for Chelsea, who will need one more win for the title if they beat Arsenal, would be the ultimate reflection of his performances. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat gives you credit is the title. If we win the title he knows that he was fundamental in the team\xe2\x80\x99s season. He deserves to be champion.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
