b'Manchester City v Barcelona: Champions league last 16 \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened | Jacob Steinberg'


b'<p>Well it\xe2\x80\x99s not the first time Lionel Messi has failed from the spot against an English side and it could have been worse for Manchester City. They looked dead and buried when they were 2-0 down at half-time, but it was a spirited response after the break and they deserved Sergio Aguero\xe2\x80\x99s goal. Will it be enough at Camp Nou, though? They\xe2\x80\x99ll have Yaya Toure back, but they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to go there and win the second leg. Which is easier said than done. Barcelona are massive favourites now, although they may well think that they should be out of sight already. They had enough chances to kill City off before Aguero\xe2\x80\x99s goal and you can\xe2\x80\x99t help but wonder if they\xe2\x80\x99ll end up regretting Messi\xe2\x80\x99s missed penalty. Probably not, on balance, but you never know. Thanks for reading. Night.</p>'
