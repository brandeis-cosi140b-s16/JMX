b'MONARCH OF THE GLENN <p>Without wishing to suggest that \xe2\x80\x98Arry Redknapp is a giant infantile psychopath who would visit ruin and atrocities upon his nation given half the chance, there is something about the QPR manager\xe2\x80\x99s new habit of collecting former England gaffers that reminds the Fiver of Idi Amin\xe2\x80\x99s fondness for bagpipes, kilts and all things Scottish. Just as the bloodthirsty former Ugandan tyrant championed Scottishness in order to rile the English while retaining a connection to his country\xe2\x80\x99s former colonial tormentors, Redknapp has developed a strange fondness for hiring jilted England bosses ever since being overlooked for the Big Gig himself. If the Fiver did not know better, we might claim the man is obsessed to the point that he is intent on devoting the rest of his career to rehabilitating fellow rejectees to prove that the FA is made up of halfwits.</p> <p>But of course that is not how it is.</p> <p>No.</p> <p>So today\xe2\x80\x99s appointment of Glenn Hoddle as QPR first-team coach, a position recently also held by Steve McClaren, was made solely in the best interests of avoiding a third successive Premier League season being illuminated by a hilarious farce in west London, following the slapstick previous escapades served up by Fulham and, yes, QPR themselves. \xe2\x80\x9cI spoke with the chairman about the possibility of bringing Glenn in and he thought it was a great idea,\xe2\x80\x9d blared Redknapp, whose previous great ideas include recommending the purchase of Christopher Samba.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cGlenn will be great,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Redknapp. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has a brilliant knowledge of the game and will be fantastic out on the training ground with the players. He is a hugely-respected coach and, like Steve, has managed his country. I decided if I was going to bring somebody in, I was going to go for somebody who was top class and that\xe2\x80\x99s what Glenn is.\xe2\x80\x9d Redknapp\xe2\x80\x99s high opinion of Hoddle is widely shared, although there has to be a suspicion that the 56-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s popularity is at least partially down to his unconventional approach to punditry \xe2\x80\x93 which entails occasionally spouting insight rather than clich\xc3\xa9s (or hooey about reincarnation) \xe2\x80\x93 more than to his most recent managerial job, a dreary stint at Wolves eight years ago. With Redknapp, Hoddle, Rio Ferdinand and Joey Barton all at Loftus Road, QPR will have plenty of experience to draw on as they battle relegation, and an ominously suitable template for a new ITV panel show.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Jacob Steinberg from 7.45pm for MBM coverage of Real Madrid 3-1 Sevilla in the European Super Cup at Cardiff City.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhere we\xe2\x80\x99ve had major incidents, we\xe2\x80\x99ve issued statements and given out information, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve been resource-constrained.

Subscribe today! And there\xe2\x80\x99s also a new app for iOS and Android \xe2\x80\x93 details of the football offering are here.</p> RECOMMENDED VIEWING <p>Julien Laurens casts his eye over the opening weekend in Ligue 1.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cGreat reading about our Swedish football superstars Kennedy Bakirciogl\xc3\xbc and Tonton Zola Moukoko (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver). The latest update on the two tells us that Kennedy is currently playing for Hammarby in the second tier of the Swedish football league, while Tonton is player-manager of the new club Kongo United FC. Stockholm-based Kongo United play in the ninth tier and are doing quite alright with eight matches played, eight wins and 86-8 in goal difference. The team\xe2\x80\x99s leading scorer is former West Ham and Sheffield Wednesday youth-team player Yanick Manzizila, who set a Swedish record last round as he scored 21 goals in Kongo\xe2\x80\x99s 33-0 thrashing of Balrog Botkyrka. All in all, Yanick has scored 58 of Kongo\xe2\x80\x99s goals this season \xe2\x80\xa6 in only seven matches\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Bj\xc3\xb6rn Dahlman.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRegarding our overburdened men in the middle, struggling under the weight of the paraphernalia the modern ref is obliged to tote around the pitch (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters). Surely a fifth official is called for? A referee\xe2\x80\x99s gentleman, who, like some sort of sports-arbitration Jeeves, can sashay on to the scene at each peep of the whistle, furnishing his master with yellow cards, vanishing spray canisters or \xe2\x80\x98sophisticated lasers and trigonometry kits\xe2\x80\x99 as the situation demands\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Paul Dring.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cA Steve Bennett commenting on a refereeing issue (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s letters)? Any chance it\xe2\x80\x99s this Steve Bennett? Even though he\xe2\x80\x99s been retired for four years, I still can\xe2\x80\x99t say his name without doing it in the style of Arnie in Commando. Any game he refereed would give plenty of chances to shout \xe2\x80\x98let off some steam, Bennett\xe2\x80\x99 at the TV\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Mark Jelbert.</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
