b'Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero wants Manchester City to alter approach against QPR'


b'<p>Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero has just brought out his autobiography and naturally it opens with a fondly remembered game in May 2012 against Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s opponents, Queens Park Rangers, and the goal that finally brought Manchester City their first league title in 44 years.</p> <p>The Argentina striker is not ashamed to admit that he watched the goal over and over again on his laptop before he went to bed that night and has watched it hundreds of times since. The photograph of him wheeling away pulling his shirt over his head has pride of place at home and he has made a showcase for the pair of boots he was wearing when he provided the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s most breathless finish.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat day will remain etched on my memory for ever,\xe2\x80\x9d Ag\xc3\xbcero says. \xe2\x80\x9cI have won other things in my career but I have never won a title like that. We had five minutes to go and we scored two goals to win us the league. I talk about it in the book in great detail because it is something I never want to forget. For that reason whenever anyone mentions Queens Park Rangers that crazy day comes to mind.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ag\xc3\xbcero would be happy to stay in that happy moment for longer, though unfortunately football has a habit of moving on. The QPR who lie in wait on Saturday are no longer the bridesmaids for City\xe2\x80\x99s biggest day but dangerous opponents fighting for survival, a visit to Loftus Road just the sort of tricky fixture Manuel Pellegrini and his players could have done without after their humbling at home by CSKA Moscow in the Champions League on Wednesday. Win, and some sort or normality will return for a while, but any other result will only increase the pressure on the manager and his underperforming side.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to be at it from the word go,\xe2\x80\x9d Ag\xc3\xbcero says. \xe2\x80\x9cAll Premier League teams make it tough for you, especially on their own grounds. QPR will be aware of our midweek disappointment and will try to capitalise on it, so we must go out with a different chip in our heads, as they say in Spain. We must find the form we usually show at home, go out with a different mentality. It is vital we get a win because we cannot let Chelsea open too much of a gap.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea, six points ahead of the defending champions after 10 games, already have opened a significant gap, though there is still a long way to go in the Premier League and City at least have the squad and course-and-distance experience to pull themselves back into the contest. The Champions League remains a different matter. City seem stubbornly resistant to change or improvement in Europe, with the result that the nine-man debacle against CSKA has left them looking at the most ignominious of exits. Ag\xc3\xbcero does not wish to contemplate that possibility; his pride and positive outlook force him to insist that progress is still possible if City win their next two matches, though he does accept that a big improvement is going to be necessary from a team who have neither won nor kept a clean sheet in any of their four Champions League games this season.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe could still be able to put things right but clearly the group table is not where we want to be and not what we would have expected,\xe2\x80\x9d he admits. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s performance, it was the previous three matches as well, especially when we were cruising at 2-0 up in Moscow before relaxing too much in the second half. None of the European performances so far have been the real City, none of them have been good enough. I do not want to give up hope when we still have a slim chance, but if we don\xe2\x80\x99t turn it around in these last two games you could consider this to be the worst Champions League campaign the club has had. What we have to try and ensure is that the real City turn up for the games against Bayern Munich and Roma.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Champions League is not an easy competition to win, everyone accepts that only the best sides and most capable managers get anywhere near club football\xe2\x80\x99s major prize, though Ag\xc3\xbcero\xe2\x80\x99s tacit acceptance that City may be going backwards in Europe raises the question of how patient he is prepared to be. At 26 he does not have an unlimited amount of time left at the top and his is the sort of talent that leading teams in Europe covet. Ag\xc3\xbcero\xe2\x80\x99s answer is emphatic. \xe2\x80\x9cI will stay at this club until we win the Champions League. I have just signed a new four-year deal, to make it eight years here in total. I will see that out and then I will stay beyond it if I get the chance.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ag\xc3\xbcero may be on to his third or fourth City manager by then. He claims, perhaps diplomatically, to like them all and suggests Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s calm exterior should not be mistaken for detachment or indifference. \xe2\x80\x9cThe two City managers I\xe2\x80\x99ve had have had different styles and ways of working,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all know Roberto Mancini was quite sparky, because you saw him animated on the touchline. Manuel is more calm but he does not hold back in the dressing room. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hide his feelings at all with the players. Of course he was angry about the performance on Wednesday, even my little boy Benjamin was mad about that, and my son told me I dived for the late penalty shout too. He might have a point, it was more of a coming together than a penalty, but the one earlier in the game was more of a shout. I definitely felt contact on my ankle.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini suggested earlier in the season that Ag\xc3\xbcero would eventually come to be regarded as one of the best attacking players of his era, right up there with Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as Balon D\xe2\x80\x99Or contenders.</p> <p>The City player smiles ruefully when reminded of the compliment, aware that you need to be performing consistently in the upper echelons of the Champions League to get that sort of attention. \xe2\x80\x9cMessi and Ronaldo are from another planet in terms of football ability \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s always going to be them in the nominations,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is an honour just to be mentioned in the same breath as those players, but realistically I need to put in some huge performances in the Champions League to ever be considered for such an award. If we don\xe2\x80\x99t do well in these next two games and get knocked out early again I guess the only way I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get a Balon D\xe2\x80\x99Or nomination is by scoring 70 goals in the Premier League this season.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero: Born To Rise \xe2\x80\x93 My Story, published by Trinity Sport Media in hardback and ebook.
