b'<p>Neymar is unlikely to be seen in the Premier League soon, though the Champions League draw on Monday has given him the chance in February to learn the truth about English playing conditions. Neymar\xe2\x80\x99s Barcelona will face Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in the opening leg of their last-16 tie on 24 February.</p> <p>In the summer of 2013 City, who were trying to lure him from his first club Santos, learned they stood no chance as the Brazilian believed specially tailored boots were required for muddy English pitches. City understood this to mean that Neymar was set on signing for Barcelona, which he did in June of that year for a fee around \xc2\xa371m. The forward has since shone for the Spanish club as well as Brazil in this summer\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup in his homelandbefore a back injury curtailed his involvement.</p> <p>In last season\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League meeting between City and Bar\xc3\xa7a he played only as a replacement in the first leg before starting the return at the Camp Nou but failed to score over the course of the tie.</p> <p>Now, adapted boots or not, he can test the conditions again.</p>'
