b'Football transfer rumours: Arsenal to sign Fernando Llorente from Juventus?'


b'<p>If the Mill wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a top, top purveyor of transfer tittle-tattle and wild speculation then it\xe2\x80\x99d probably be either Martin Roberts or Lucy Alexander of Homes under the Hammer. Looking out for signs of damp, checking out coving, suggesting knocking through that wall to make a delightful breakfast bar that would really open up the space, turning up with estate agents to find out exactly how much money you could squeeze out of your property as a landlord \xe2\x80\xa6 that sort of thing.</p>  <p> Related: Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s Louis van Gaal considers selling Robin van Persie </p>   <p>So today\xe2\x80\x99s tabloid round-up is something of a dream come true. Raheem Sterling, you see, has apparently \xe2\x80\x9ctaken the first steps\xe2\x80\x9d towards putting his Merseyside house on the market, which presumably means he has been scrolling idly through Zoopla or Right Move. But this news has put Arsenal and Chelsea \xe2\x80\x9con alert\xe2\x80\x9d, because the forward is now looking for a property in London.</p> <p>In other hot English starlet news, Manchester City have set their sights on snaring West Brom\xe2\x80\x99s Saido Berahino. The powers that be at the Etihad want an influx of young English talent so the Baggies forward, the aforementioned Sterling, Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Jack Wilshere and Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s Danny Rose are all making quiet blipping noises on the City radar.</p> <p>Bad news for Arsenal: Palermo\xe2\x80\x99s Paulo Dybala looks set to join Juventus rather than the Gunners in a \xe2\x82\xac30m deal. Good news for Arsenal: that could mean Fernando Llorente is surplus to requirements in Turin and Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger quite fancies a move for the Spanish striker instead. He\xe2\x80\x99ll have to fight it out with Tottenham and Valencia, mind.</p> <p>Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s Danny Ings is off to Anfield, though you probably already knew that, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be joined by the Inter midfield maestro Mateo Kovacic, who\xe2\x80\x99ll take around \xc2\xa315m to prise from Milan. Inter will cushion the blow by signing Southampton misfit Gast\xc3\xb3n Ram\xc3\xadrez. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a busy summer for Brendan Rodgers and co \xe2\x80\x93 they\xe2\x80\x99re also hot on the trail of Real Sociedad\xe2\x80\x99s I\xc3\xb1igo Mart\xc3\xadnez, though they will have to fork out \xc2\xa321.7m to get their man, and Rennes wide man Paul-Georges Ntep.</p>  <p> Related: Manchester City offer Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 to try to land Juventus\xe2\x80\x99s Paul Pogba </p>   <p>In other European news, Borussia Dortmund are leading the race to snap up Charlton Athletic wonderkid Joe Gomez. The 17-year-old defender has sparked the interest of Arsenal, Manchester City and Manchester United but Dortmund are hopeful of wrapping up a deal for \xc2\xa31m.</p> <p>In what will surely be the most drab bit of today\xe2\x80\x99s tittle tattle, West Brom are keen to sign Hull\xe2\x80\x99s James Chester.</p> <p>The Baggies also want Marseille\xe2\x80\x99s Andr\xc3\xa9-Pierre Gignac, which is a bit more like it, and Inter are going to splash \xc2\xa310m on Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 if it\xe2\x80\x99s the last thing they do. Lazio, meanwhile, have \xc2\xa312m burning a hole in their pocket and want to spend it all on Fabio Borini for some reason.</p>'
