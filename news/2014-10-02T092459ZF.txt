b'Football transfer rumours: Arsenal to end Edinson Cavani\xe2\x80\x99s PSG hell?'


b'<p>The Mill has always been a fan of tiresome cliches and so it takes great delight to inform our dear readers that good things most certainly come in threes for Daniel Sturridge. Firstly, he was spared Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s limp defeat at the hands of Basel on Wednesday night, watching from the comfort of his living room, munching on Toblerone and watching his stock rise with every misplaced pass from the Yellows. Secondly, according to Brendan Rodgers, he is only fit enough to play for Liverpool, meaning he will on Thursday be spared secondment to military service/England duty, where Roy Hodgson\xe2\x80\x99s men face San Marino and Estonia \xe2\x80\x93 180 minutes that none of us will get back. And thirdly, Sturridge is due to be handed a brand spanking new \xc2\xa3150,000-a-week, five-year contract, just reward for his one goal in four matches this season. It\xe2\x80\x99s as if a genie has been visiting the Sturridge household.</p> <p>In other \xe2\x80\x9cgood things come in threes for people called Daniel\xe2\x80\x9d news, Danny Welbeck scored three goals in the same game for the first time in his career against Galatasaray, prompting the lazy comparison to Thierry Henry \xe2\x80\x93 a comparison the Mill will not tire of making. Henry, though, may be set for his 45th spell with the Gunners following the news that he is to leave the New York Red Bulls in December but has absolutely no intention of hanging up his boots.</p> <p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger, however, is thinking bigger. Ever the altruist, the Frenchman plans to ignore the threadbare nature of his defence as well as his injury-depleted midfield ranks and rescue Edinson Cavani from his Parisian hell. Cavani is so sad in the French capital that, according to L\xe2\x80\x99Equipe, his eyes no longer sparkle but \xc2\xa355m of Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s finest will no doubt put that right in January.</p> <p>Back to lazy cliches and Cheik Tiot\xc3\xa9 has issued a come-and-get-me plea to Arsenal, revealing that he wants to leave Newcastle and urging the Gunners to follow up their summer interest. Wenger has responded with a no-I-won\xe2\x80\x99t riposte.</p> <p>The Mill has long since been aware of Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the Napoli striker Gonzalo Higua\xc3\xadn but in further developments, Rodgers plans to dangle human metronome Lucas Leiva as bait for the Argentinian.</p> <p>Shopping in Italy is en vogue at the moment and Manchester United have been put on red alert after Roma\xe2\x80\x99s manager, Rudi Garc\xc3\xada, revealed the club cannot prevent Kevin Strootman leaving in January. Ed Woodward is wiping away the saliva with \xc2\xa350 notes.</p> <p>Tottenham, however, have not learned their lesson. Having prised Roma\xe2\x80\x99s previous prized asset away the summer before last and set Erik Lamela\xe2\x80\x99s career trajectory due south, Daniel Levy seems keen on Sampdoria\xe2\x80\x99s Manolo Gabbiadini, whose agent has stoked the fires by saying his client will categorically not be moving in January.</p> <p>In other news, Sami Khedira has announced he wants to come to the Premier League in January, which has pricked the ears of Chelsea, Arsenal and Liverpool while Nani plans to make his move to Sporting Lisbon permanent in the summer and Dani Alves wants to come to England next year.</p>'
