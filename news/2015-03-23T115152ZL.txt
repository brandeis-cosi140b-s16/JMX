b'<p>Just over two decades have passed since Serie A\xe2\x80\x99s first Sunday evening game. Many people opposed the innovation back then. Giampiero Boniperti growled that football was becoming a \xe2\x80\x9cslave to television\xe2\x80\x9d. The prominent radio commentator Alfredo Provenzali likened the situation to churches introducing a Saturday evening service for worshippers who preferred to be elsewhere on the Sabbath. \xe2\x80\x9cHaving Mass on a Sunday was more than just a formality,\xe2\x80\x9d he sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the end, something has been lost.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Imagine how he might have felt surveying this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s fixture list. Just a single game, Juventus versus Genoa, was to kick-off in Italy\xe2\x80\x99s traditional 3pm Sunday slot. One other would be played at 12.30pm the same day, while two more were scheduled for the night before. That left an incredible six matches for Sunday evening.</p> <p>Serie A\xe2\x80\x99s administrators would defend the move by saying that they wanted to be even-handed. Five of these late games involved clubs that had played in the Europa League on Thursday night. The league has gone out of its way in recent seasons to accommodate clubs competing in continental competition, in a bid to help repair Italy\xe2\x80\x99s diminished Uefa coefficient.</p> <p>Still, it made for a surreal Sunday. Rather than abandon their traditional 6pm highlights show, 90\xc2\xba Minuto, state broadcaster Rai called in a pair of retired analysts and had them review classic games from the 1990s instead. If officials had hoped that this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s unusual arrangements might generate a little extra hype around Serie A, here instead was a reminder of how the league\xe2\x80\x99s standards had slipped.</p> <p>Even more damaging, in the eyes of some observers, was the fact that the bulk of Italy\xe2\x80\x99s top-flight matches had been pitted directly against El Cl\xc3\xa1sico in the TV schedules. La Repubblica\xe2\x80\x99s Concetto Vecchio deemed such a wilful clash to be \xe2\x80\x9cincomprehensible\xe2\x80\x9d. His colleague, Fabrizio Bocca, acknowledged that, \xe2\x80\x9cOnce the remote has switched over to [La Liga rights holder] Fox, it is hard to go back.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>If there was truth to those words, then anyone who did stick with the Serie A schedule will still have found plenty to hold their attention. At the Marassi, \xc3\x89der \xe2\x80\x93 the Brazilian-born forward who last week accepted his first call-up to the Italian national team \xe2\x80\x93 swerved a breathtaking free-kick past Samir Handanovic to see Sampdoria past Inter. At the Stadio San Paolo, 10-man Atalanta fought to an improbable draw against Napoli.</p> <p>Most captivating of all, however, might have been Lazio\xe2\x80\x99s Felipe Anderson. After signing a new five-year contract with the club last week, the Brazilian had issued a rallying cry to his team\xe2\x80\x99s fans, saying he wanted \xe2\x80\x9ceveryone at the stadium\xe2\x80\x9d. Those words were heeded. Lazio\xe2\x80\x99s average attendance his season has hovered at just over 30,000 people but more than 40,000 showed up for Sunday night\xe2\x80\x99s fixture against lowly Verona.</p> <p>It is a wonder that anybody needed the encouragement. Anderson has been one of the most entertaining players to watch not only in Italy this season, but in any of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s top leagues. Claimed by Lazio\xe2\x80\x99s in-house telemetrics team to be the fastest player in Serie A, his sudden accelerations and knack for improvisation led Gazzetta dello Sport to define his style as \xe2\x80\x9cdance rock\xe2\x80\x9d. Anderson dribbles past opponents more frequently than any other player in the division.</p> <p>His resilience, as well has his talent, has been extraordinary. It took Anderson a full year after his 2013 switch from Santos to adjust to both football in Italy and life away from the pitch. As noted previously in this column, he put on significant weight during his first season simply because he did not know how to order anything other than a spaghetti carbonara and a fizzy drink when he went out for dinner.</p> <p>Having finally found his feet and begun to establish himself as a leading protagonist for Lazio this past winter \xe2\x80\x93 racking up five goals and five assists in as many games \xe2\x80\x93 he saw his progress checked by a January knee injury that would keep him out of action for four weeks. In the same month, his father was arrested on homicide charges.</p> <p>Anderson took all this in his stride, returning to the starting XI in mid-February, and almost single-handedly demolishing Sassuolo a fortnight later, when he scored Lazio\xe2\x80\x99s first and set up the second in a 3-0 win. He has not looked back since.</p> <p>Europe\xe2\x80\x99s richest clubs have been taking notice. Whilst even some Italians might have preferred to watch El Cl\xc3\xa1sico on Sunday night, at least one Manchester United scout is reported to have shown up at the Stadio Olimpico for a close look at Anderson instead. Real Madrid, Chelsea and Manchester City had all been linked with the Brazilian in recent weeks, their interest no doubt influencing Lazio\xe2\x80\x99s decision to extend his contract \xe2\x80\x93 which already ran through 2018.</p> <p>United\xe2\x80\x99s scout had chosen a good week to see what all the fuss was about. Anderson opened the scoring against Verona in the fourth minute with his first-ever headed goal. Just after the quarter-hour mark, he combined with Lucas Biglia to release Miroslav Klose \xe2\x80\x93 only for the German to fluff his lines. Later, Anderson intercepted a pass in midfield and embarked on a 60-yard run that ended with his shot being tipped onto the crossbar.</p> <p>So great has the media focus been on the Brazilian been lately that Lazio made a post on their own Facebook page earlier in the week insisting that the team was not \xe2\x80\x9cFelipe dependent\xe2\x80\x9d. They were justified in arguing that their team contains several other fine players \xe2\x80\x93 not least among them Antonio Candreva, who scored their second against Verona from a free-kick that he had earned himself on the edge of the area.</p> <p>However, it is no coincidence that Lazio have won six games in a row since Anderson returned from injury, vaulting Napoli as they moved up into the Champions League places. He has now scored or set up a total of 16 goals in his last 12 appearances. Lazio finished the weekend four points clear of their nearest rivals in third.</p> <p>Earlier this season, Anderson was nicknamed FA7 by Lazio\xe2\x80\x99s supporters \xe2\x80\x93 a nod to Cristiano Ronaldo\xe2\x80\x99s CR7 moniker. But he owes much more in his career to Neymar, with whom he played at Santos and who has referred to him in the past as a \xe2\x80\x9clittle brother\xe2\x80\x9d. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was the one who advised me to come here, to have courage and to believe in myself more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anderson after Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s game. \xe2\x80\x9cI will thank him forever.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>So too might Lazio\xe2\x80\x99s supporters. Even if Neymar and his Barcelona colleagues did steal a few TV viewers away from their team on Sunday night.</p> Talking points: <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 We already touched on \xc3\x89der\xe2\x80\x99s goal and international call-up above but Sampdoria\xe2\x80\x99s all-around form also merits a mention. Their four consecutive wins means they too have leapfrogged Napoli to move into fourth place. Despite selling their most prolific player, Manolo Gabbiadini, in January, Sampdoria remain very much alive in the hunt for a Champions League place and that alone is extraordinary.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 \xc3\x89der was not the only foreign-born player called-up by Antonio Conte for Italy\xe2\x80\x99s games against Bulgaria and England. Franco V\xc3\xa1zquez also made the cut, although in his case the timing seems a little more curious since Palermo \xe2\x80\x93 who lost 1-0 to Chievo at the weekend \xe2\x80\x93 have not scored in a month. Both players\xe2\x80\x99 inclusion will inevitably kick off fresh debate about Italy\xe2\x80\x99s use of oriundi but Conte did make one other intriguing first-time selection in the person of Mirko Valdifiori, whose distribution from the heart of midfield has contributed a great deal to Empoli\xe2\x80\x99s surprisingly assured first season back in the top-flight.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 One man not included in this latest Italy squad was Daniele De Rossi \xe2\x80\x93 whose recent form has not merited inclusion. He responded by scoring the goal that brought Roma their first league victory since 8 February. An 1-0 win away to Cesena ought not to be a big deal for this team but after their humiliating Europa League defeat to Fiorentina on Thursday \xe2\x80\x93 and subsequent pow-wow with the ultras \xe2\x80\x93 a fillip of any kind was urgently required.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Francesco Totti missed the Cesena game due to injury, instead going to watch his son Cristian play in an Under-11s derby against Lazio. The younger Totti set up a goal in his team\xe2\x80\x99s 3-1 win.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Milan collected their third league win of 2015, beating Cagliari 3-1 but more illuminating than anything that happened on the pitch were the images of an empty Curva Sud at San Siro. Ultras from that section of the stadium had issued a statement declaring themselves to be on strike on Friday and inviting all other fans to both stay away and stop purchasing official club merchandise. They accused Silvio Berlusconi of blowing smoke in their faces by promising a return to the glory days of the past and demanded to know if he was serious about either investing in the club again or selling it. On the day of the game itself, a small number entered to hang banners which read (in English) \xe2\x80\x9cGame Over\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the end\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cInsert coin &amp; #SaveACMilan\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Although the Rossoneri were, ultimately, good value for the three points, their margin of victory might have been smaller were it not for the scandalous penalty decision given in their favour 12 minutes from time. Alessio Cerci was a good half-yard outside the box when he was brought down by Luca Ceppitelli but was awarded a spot-kick anyway. The latter player\xe2\x80\x99s team-mate, Danilo Avelar, highlighted the injustice by walking behind Milan\xe2\x80\x99s Ignazio Abate as he conducted a TV interview after the game, holding up a phone which showed a still image of the foul taking place.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Carlos Tevez kept Juventus rolling towards their fourth-straight Scudetto with a brilliant slalom and finish against Genoa. He once again leads the scoring charts with 16 goals, although J\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9my M\xc3\xa9nez is now level with Mauro Icardi in second-place on 15.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Napoli were none-too-impressed with the failure of referee Gianpaolo Calvarese to spot that Mauricio Pinilla had fouled Henrique in the buildup to Atalanta\xe2\x80\x99s goal against them on Sunday and duly railed against the decision to assign the official to their game. \xe2\x80\x9c[FIGC president Carlo] Tavecchio cannot lose his credibility in this way,\xe2\x80\x9d tweeted Napoli\xe2\x80\x99s official account, presumably whilst also nudging shut a stable door through which horses had long since bolted. \xe2\x80\x9cA refereeing performance not worthy of Serie A which falsifies the league. In England this would not have happened.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Results: Cesena 0-1 Roma, Chievo 1-0 Palermo, Empoli 3-1 Sassuolo, Juventus 1-0 Genoa, Lazio 2-0 Verona, Milan 3-1 Cagliari, Napoli 1-1 Atalanta, Parma 0-2 Torino, Sampdoria 1-0 Inter, Udinese 2-2 Fiorentina</p>'
