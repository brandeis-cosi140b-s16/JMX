b'Monaco v Arsenal: live Champions League webchat with Amy Lawrence'


b'<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s all folks. Here are those previews again:</p> <p>Monaco take the cut-price route and find themselves richly in profitArsenal need three goals to progress into the Champions League quarter-finals at the Stade Louis II, a ground where Monaco have not conceded that many in game since 2011</p> <p>Arsenal determined to defy Champions League statistics in MonacoTo put it into context, the cold, harsh reality for Arsenal is that no team have ever qualified in the Champion League era after losing the home leg of a knockout tie by more than one goal and needing to score at least twice, never mind the three or more that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s men will need to stand any chance of turning their tie against Monaco upside down.</p> <p>Arsenal can consign first-leg disaster to history, says Per MertesackerPer Mertesacker made the stark admission that Arsenal had effectively bottled the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie with Monaco. The 3-1 defeat at the Emirates Stadium has left them with what Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger has described as a mountain to climb and it is one that is rather steeper than the incline up to the casino here in Monte Carlo.</p>    <div class="d2-comment-embedded" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Comment"> <div class="d2-left-col">     Guardian staff </div> <div class="d2-right-col"> <div itemscope itemprop="author" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">  AmyL  </div> <div class="d2-permalink"> 17 March 2015 2:38pm </div> <div class="d2-body" itemprop="text"><p>Thanks folks for the pleasure of your company and your questions.
