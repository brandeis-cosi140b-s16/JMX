b'Terry Burton says Arsenal are way behind Chelsea in youth development'


b'<p>Arsenal have fallen a long way behind Chelsea in all aspects of their youth set up and made a \xe2\x80\x9cbig mistake\xe2\x80\x9d by appointing an overseas academy manager to replace Liam Brady \xe2\x80\x93 that is the verdict of Terry Burton, who left his position as head of coaching at the London club in the summer and is now West Bromwich Albion\xe2\x80\x99s technical director.</p> <p>Burton, who had two previous spells at Arsenal, including a highly successful period as the club\xe2\x80\x99s youth coach during a golden era in the 1980s that saw Tony Adams, David Rocastle, Michael Thomas, Paul Davis, Paul Merson and Martin Keown come through, applied for Brady\xe2\x80\x99s job but was overlooked. Steve Morrow, Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s head of scouting for the youth academy, also missed out.</p> <p>After two interviews for the post, the second with Ivan Gazidis, the Arsenal chief executive, Burton eventually learned that Andries Jonker, a Dutchman who was assistant manager at Wolfsburg at the time, was going to be appointed as Brady\xe2\x80\x99s replacement.</p> <p>Burton was bitterly disappointed with that decision and in January told Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger \xe2\x80\x93 who had informed him that he played no part in the selection process \xe2\x80\x93 that he would leave the club at the end of the season, two years after he had rejoined as reserves and head development coach. \xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to stay there without a purpose and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see one,\xe2\x80\x9d Burton said in an interview with the Guardian. \xe2\x80\x9cI still think they\xe2\x80\x99ve made a big mistake. I think if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t me, there\xe2\x80\x99s good people out there that they could have put in.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a massive job. There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work to be done there. Arsenal, with respect, have fallen behind. They just weren\xe2\x80\x99t working hard enough, like Chelsea. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got the best pathway, because they\xe2\x80\x99ve got Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger, who gives young players a chance, better than any other club. But the processes, and things that had just been missing over a period of years, Chelsea had steamed ahead in their recruitment and all aspects of it really. That gap can close. But it\xe2\x80\x99s too soon to tell. The guy there ... you\xe2\x80\x99ll have a better idea in five years.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Barton maintains that Gazidis had no need to look overseas for a successor to Brady. \xe2\x80\x9cI told him: \xe2\x80\x98I think you\xe2\x80\x99re mad. I think you\xe2\x80\x99ve got it wrong. If ever you were going to get it right, I was the best person to do it.\xe2\x80\x99 I knew the club, I knew the players that we\xe2\x80\x99d got and didn\xe2\x80\x99t have. I knew from under-12s right the way through.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI went to see Ars\xc3\xa8ne, and Ars\xc3\xa8ne said he\xe2\x80\x99d had nothing to do with it \xe2\x80\x93 he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t signed his contract at that time. I told Ars\xc3\xa8ne in the January that I would leave in the summer. He said: \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t go, I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to stay\xe2\x80\x99. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to work under someone else. I was prepared to do it because it was Liam Brady, but not someone brought in from outside.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
