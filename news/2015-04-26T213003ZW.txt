b'<p>Watford\xe2\x80\x99s ecstatic players heard of their promotion to the Premier League as the team coach turned into their Hertfordshire training ground on Saturday evening. The season has been another extraordinary journey.</p> <p>Earlier in the afternoon their head coach, Slavisa Jokanovic, had been downbeat after the 2-0 win at Brighton that set in motion a dramatic train of events in which both Middlesbrough and Norwich City failed to bridge the Watford gap of four points at the top of the Championship.</p> <p>Ross McCormack\xe2\x80\x99s last-minute winner in Fulham\xe2\x80\x99s 4-3 win over Boro at Craven Cottage and Jordan Bowery\xe2\x80\x99s late equaliser for struggling Rotherham in the 1-1 draw with Norwich means Bournemouth are favourites for the second automatic promotion spot.</p> <p>Bournemouth can make up lost ground by beating Bolton Wanderers on Monday night. Eddie Howe\xe2\x80\x99s side and Watford arguably play the most attractive football in the Championship. But both may struggle to survive in the Premier League and if it is difficult to imagine a homespun team from Dorset trading blows with Manchester United and Chelsea, the rise of Watford is just as remarkable.</p> <p>The Serb Jokanovic was Watford\xe2\x80\x99s fourth manager of the season when he took charge in October. Giuseppe Sannino, last season\xe2\x80\x99s Brighton manager \xc3\x93scar Garc\xc3\xada and Billy McKinlay were in the Vicarage Road white-hot seat before Jokanovic took over. The former Chelsea midfielder has evaded questions about his future at Watford and Sunderland are known to be interested in recruiting him.</p> <p>Jokanovic was also almost lost for words at Watford\xe2\x80\x99s promotion which means a win over Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday will make them champions of the division for the first time. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a crazy Championship. Incredible. We are very happy but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to explain it to you. I am a bit surprised and I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what we will do now or in the future.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Outside the Brighton dressing-rooms , Jokanovic had said the team had no plans to celebrate and were concentrating on trying to beat Sheffield Wednesday. Those sensible plans soon went out of the window as fellow diners at an Italian restaurant in Watford on Saturday night could testify.</p> <p>Watford\xe2\x80\x99s two goals at the Amex Stadium were scored by their captain, Troy Deeney, and the Czech international Matej Vydra. Both are survivors of the Wembley Championship play-off defeat by Crystal Palace two years ago when Kevin Phillips\xe2\x80\x99 late winner left Watford devastated, although Vydra is in his second spell at Vicarage Road after playing with Udinese.</p> <p>Odion Ighalo, the Nigerian striker who is also on loan from the Italian club, believes Watford can survive in the Premier League. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe we can stay there. It won\xe2\x80\x99t be easy but I believe we can compete. I have played in the Italian and Spanish Leagues and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the Premier League will be a lot different. The tempo is very high but I\xe2\x80\x99ll work hard. Playing in the Premier League is one of my dreams and when I came to England I could see that this team had what it needed to win promotion,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>It now looks likely that the play-offs will pitch Middlesbrough, Norwich City, Ipswich Town and Derby County together, with Derby, beaten by Queens Park Rangers at Wembley last spring, only drawing 3-3 at Millwall, a game that throws the south London side a lifeline at the bottom, while Wigan\xe2\x80\x99s 1-0 defeat to Wolves means they will be relegated if Rotherham avoid defeat by Reading on Tuesday.</p> <p>Brighton have been generous hosts to three of the promotion contenders this month, Norwich and Bournemouth both winning here in the last three weeks, and Middlesbrough play Chris Hughton\xe2\x80\x99s side at the Riverside on Saturday. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a responsibility to the league to put in our best performance at Boro and we\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking to win there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hughton, who took over as Brighton manager on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve. But Brighton have scored only one goal in six games this month and their pea-shooter attack is unlikely to disturb another of the Championship big guns.</p>'
