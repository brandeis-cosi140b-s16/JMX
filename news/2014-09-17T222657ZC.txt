b'Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Diego Costa is struggling with hamstring, says Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has admitted Diego Costa is still struggling from the hamstring problems sustained on international duty with Spain this month and the niggling injury is not allowing the striker to play two games in four days.</p> <p>Costa, who has scored seven times in his four Premier League starts including a hat-trick against Swansea on Saturday, was restricted to a late cameo from the bench against Schalke as Mourinho was intent on ensuring the \xc2\xa332m signing from Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid is fit enough to feature in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s trip to the champions, Manchester City.</p>           Manager Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho says Chelsea gave everything in their opening Champions League Group G match against Schalke    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe has a problem and he can\xe2\x80\x99t play, in this moment, three matches in a week,\xe2\x80\x9d said the manager, who selected Didier Drogba in Costa\xe2\x80\x99s stead. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he has one week to let the muscle recover he can start again like he was before he had that problem with the national team. But three days, after Saturday, is not enough.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNot selecting him here was not to protect him for the game for Sunday, but because today he was not in the condition after Saturday. He had a problem in the national team, not with us. And now we have a problem and have to resolve it as best we can. He was not fit enough to start against Schalke. On Sunday we believe he will be. Next week against Bolton [in the Capital One Cup], for sure he won\xe2\x80\x99t be. We have to manage the situation until the moment he\xe2\x80\x99s completely fine. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know [how long that will be]. But, if today he had started the game, for sure he could not play on Sunday. We have to go step by step.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
