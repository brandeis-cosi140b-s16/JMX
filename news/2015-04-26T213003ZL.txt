b'Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s Nigel Pearson warns \xe2\x80\x98job\xe2\x80\x99s not done\xe2\x80\x99 after win over Burnley'


b'<p>If the mysterious events on the night of Nigel Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s on-off sacking have taught Leicester City\xe2\x80\x99s manager anything it is that it is pointless to get too carried away with success or failure in football. One minute a manager has been handed his P45, the next he still has his job. Teams can be written off as relegation certainties for months and then force people to revise their opinions with one well-timed run. Ultimately no one can predict the future with 100% accuracy, which is why managers and players prefer to take each game as it comes.</p> <p>Two and a half months ago, the evening after Leicester had sunk deeper into the mire after losing at home to Crystal Palace, reports emerged that Pearson had been fired. In the end he survived. But Leicester continued to lose. They continued to play well. But they continued to lose. Leicester were bottom at the end of last month and they looked doomed when they lost 4-3 to Tottenham Hotspur on 21 March.</p> <p>Little did anyone know that revival was lurking around the corner. Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s results in April have been spectacular and Jamie Vardy\xe2\x80\x99s winner against Burnley moved them out of the bottom three for the first time since November. It was Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s fourth consecutive victory and suddenly they are expected to stay up. They are the flavour of the month, one of the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s form teams.</p> <p>Pearson, whose side host Chelsea on Wednesday and Newcastle United on Saturday, is wary. He wants his players to remain focused. Leicester are 17th, a point above Sunderland, and they were mediocre for long spells against Burnley.</p> <p>They willed themselves to victory, though, and it was put to Pearson that Leicester possess more belief now. His message was that nothing is more important than the next game. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s always easy to ask those types of questions when you\xe2\x80\x99re winning games and easier for me to answer them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut for people who have been following us all season one of the main threads is the players have never really lost their belief, and that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be important because we\xe2\x80\x99ve still got five games left and if people think the job\xe2\x80\x99s over then they might be in for a bit of a surprise.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pearson will not prioritise the game against Newcastle over the one against Chelsea. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got things I need to look at,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9c[David] Nugent\xe2\x80\x99s been out injured, [Jeffrey] Schlupp\xe2\x80\x99s injured, Vardy\xe2\x80\x99s had an injection in his foot before he plays today. We\xe2\x80\x99ll assess it and we want to win that game. Simple as.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>History is not necessarily on Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s side in their battle for survival. Last weekend\xe2\x80\x99s victory over Swansea City moved them off the bottom for the first time in 140 days and no team have stayed up after spending that long at the foot of the table.</p> <p>Yet Pearson bucked a trend 10 years ago. He was Bryan Robson\xe2\x80\x99s assistant at West Bromwich Albion when they became the first side in Premier League history to stay up after being bottom at Christmas. Not that Pearson is reading too much into it.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not about drawing parallels, it\xe2\x80\x99s about the players you have,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNo two situations are the same. If you try and replicate what happened in other situations it\xe2\x80\x99s not applicable, because the only thing that is the thread is the players have got to have belief and we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to make sure that we understand that every game is important, regardless of who we play against, and that we give 100%. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be doing that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The victory over Burnley hinged on a rollercoaster 60 seconds. Who knows what would have happened if Matt Taylor had scored his penalty after 59 minutes? Yet Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s effort struck the left post and Leicester took the lead with their next attack, Vardy tapping in from a yard out after Marc Albrighton\xe2\x80\x99s cross caused havoc in the Burnley area.</p> <p>Burnley are bottom of the league and winless in their past five matches. Sean Dyche\xe2\x80\x99s side are five points behind Leicester and three of their final four matches are away from home.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou look at Leicester and they have won four on the bounce,\xe2\x80\x9d Taylor said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s achievable. There are still four games left and until anyone tells us it\xe2\x80\x99s mathematically certain in terms of our status in the Premier League then we will keep fighting. That\xe2\x80\x99s the players we\xe2\x80\x99ve got here and that\xe2\x80\x99s the manager we\xe2\x80\x99ve got here. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to keep doing everything we can. That\xe2\x80\x99s the realism.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Man of the match: Jamie Vardy (Leicester City)</p>'
