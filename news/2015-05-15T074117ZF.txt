b'Football: 10 things to look out for this weekend'


b'1) The biggest East Anglia derby in history <p>What a year it has been so far for the quick-learning Alex Neil. This time 12 months ago he was a player-manager guiding Hamilton Academical through the play-offs and into the Scottish Premier League, where he led them to their first victory at Celtic in 76 years before answering Norwich City\xe2\x80\x99s rescue plea. Since arriving at Carrow Road in January, the Scot has got the Canaries singing again. The 33-year-old began this week by flying to Glasgow to take part in a coaching course as he continues working towards gaining a Uefa Pro Licence, and on Saturday he will undergo the sternest test of his knowledge so far, as he seeks to mastermind a play-off semi-final victory over Mick McCarthy, whose standing as a wily old promotion guru has been enhanced by Ipswich Town\xe2\x80\x99s vibrancy this season. Norwich confirmed in the first leg that their players are more technically talented but Ipswich, in a 4-3-3 rather than the 4-4-2 McCarthy used for most of the season, pretty much matched them in terms of chances created and the signs are that Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s clash will be far tighter than the clubs\xe2\x80\x99 respective resources suggest it should be. The biggest East Anglian derby in history will be tense to play in, essential to watch. PD</p> 2) Can Monk bring himself to kick the winning habit? <p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger may not be a fan of the tradition of sharing a post-match glass of wine with opposing managers, but there was a discernible whiff of sour grapes off the Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s breath after his side\xe2\x80\x99s defeat at the hands of Swansea City last Monday. In being criticised for not instructing his team to roll over and play to Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s strengths, Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s opposite number, Garry Monk, enjoyed another rite of passage and the young manager must be frustrated that the better his squad performs, the more likely they are to be \xe2\x80\x9crewarded\xe2\x80\x9d with a punishing Europa League schedule for which they are currently not equipped. </p> <p> Beating Manchester City would be another feather in the cap of a young manager whose millinery is already resplendent with a dizzying array of plumage after only one full season in charge at the Liberty Stadium. Considering one major Swansea-related talk point earlier this season concerned the huge number of points they were losing from winning positions, Monk could be excused for hoping to avoid the Europa League to see just how many of those points that were squandered or stolen through refereeing incompetence can be retrieved without the distraction of Europe. </p> <p> It is a boring but relevant complaint, but one suspects Monk\xe2\x80\x99s natural competitiveness and honesty will result in his side giving their all against Manchester City, even if it does go against their impressive manager\xe2\x80\x99s better judgement. BG</p> 3) Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s final game at Anfield     Steven Gerrard prepares for a not-quite-fairytale farewell Photograph: BPI/Rex Shutterstock    <p>It is not the end that the fairytale writers wanted \xe2\x80\x93 a winning goal in this season\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup final would have suited their script better \xe2\x80\x93 but Steven Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s final competitive match at Anfield being an ultimately inconsequential bout with Crystal Palace is, in a way, a better expression of the romance between Gerrard and Liverpool. Because the fact that Liverpool have been a sub-elite side for most of Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s career is part of what makes his achievements with, and loyalty to, the club so special. What is more, leaving aside a certain slapstick slip and instead remembering super-hero goals like the ones against Olympiakos, West Ham and Milan, Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s career has also been defined spectacularly by impeccable timing \xe2\x80\x93 and now, whether he agrees or not, is the right time for him to go. It would be hard to watch him besmirch his legacy by ageing gracelessly in the Premier League; but it will be heartening to watch the affectionate farewell he is sure to get this weekend. And, go on then, a winning goal from the man himself would be lovely too. PD</p> 4) Somebody get Dick Advocaat an abacus  <p>A fine football manager with a proven track record he may be, but since arriving on Wearside Dick Advocaat has given every indication that mathematics are not his strong point. Since he announced that Sunderland needed another six points to guarantee safety from relegation, his players have returned seven and are still in grave danger of falling into the Championship. Now he\xe2\x80\x99s been at it again, telling reporters that \xe2\x80\x9cwe need to give more than 100 per cent to get the result against Leicester\xe2\x80\x9d on Saturday, when anyone with a passing acquaintance with an abacus knows that in the context of human endeavour, the use of improper percentages is nonsensical.</p> <p>Through a combination of obdurate defending and outrageous good fortune, Sunderland somehow managed to dispatch Everton last weekend without troubling mathematical pedants with their exertions, but will surely need more about them to beat a Leicester City team who are high on the hog after six wins out of seven and plainly better than their Wearside rivals, but far from secure enough to risk complacency. While victory for either team will guarantee their presence in the Premier League next season, Leicester will almost certainly settle for a draw. With visits to Arsenal and Chelsea to come for the numerically challenged Advocaat and his players, it will be intriguing to see how he sets out his stall for an eminently winnable game in which Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s biggest obstacle could prove their fear of losing. BG</p> 5) PSG on brink of title \xe2\x80\xa6 and the Ligue 1 battle below  <p>It is going to take something supernatural to stop Paris Saint-Germain from being crowned champions now, but for a while Lyon put up a gallant fight. Victory over Bordeaux this weekend would be their 15th home league win of the season, their best haul ever, and confirm a highly commendable second-place finish. But the real intrigue concerns France\xe2\x80\x99s third representatives in next season\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League: Marcelo Bielsa\xe2\x80\x99s chaotic Marseille pulled back to within two points of Leonardo Jardim\xe2\x80\x99s rigorous Monaco in third place after beating them last weekend and suddenly have a chance of leapfrogging the Mon\xc3\xa9gasques in the final two matches. Even if Monaco do not drop points at home to already-relegated Metz on Saturday, a win for Marseille at Lille would tee up a tense final weekend. PD</p> 6) QPR take on Newcastle in a potential resistible force paradox  <p>It is a measure of how far Newcastle United have fallen under Mike Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing and apparently interminable spell as club \xe2\x80\x9ccustodian\xe2\x80\x9d that a home draw with West Bromwich Albion was enough to generate patronising front-page headlines in the sport supplements of several British newspapers last weekend. A draw with West Brom as headline news? Yes, it has really come to this. </p> <p>While the delight generated by thoroughly disillusioned fans witnessing their team secure a solitary point from the past 27 available was insufficient to prompt John Carver and his players to parade around Newcastle city centre on a Sports Direct-branded open-top bus, it was certainly better than nothing. But with safety far from secured, Carver must bring his team to Loftus Road where they will be hosted by a club that is already consigned to the drop and arguably even more dysfunctional. </p> <p>Quite what will happen once they get there is anyone\xe2\x80\x99s guess. With the slim hope of survival on the line against Manchester City last Sunday, QPR failed to put up any sort of fight and raised the white flag of surrender within 10 minutes. Football being the rum old do that it can occasionally be, it would surprise nobody \xe2\x80\x93 except perhaps their own fans \xe2\x80\x93 if they played out of their skins against Newcastle, rather than flip-flop their way through the motions and make life easier for visitors who may well be paralysed with fear. Will both teams give their all? Will either team give their all? Does either team even have an \xe2\x80\x9call\xe2\x80\x9d? On the face of all available recent evidence, even Mystic Meg would tie herself in knots pondering those imponderables. BG</p> 7) Can Man United avenge March\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup embarrassment?     Danny Welbeck\xe2\x80\x99s goal at Old Trafford in March was one of the highlights of his and Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s seaosn Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Reuters    <p>The last time Manchester United and Arsenal met at Old Trafford was in the FA Cup two months ago, when United\xe2\x80\x99s underperforming players made it clear in no uncertain terms that their manager had plenty of work to do as far as whipping his latest work in progress is concerned. While the margin of defeat was only one goal, there was a visible gulf in class on an evening when Danny Welbeck stepped up to force-feed Louis van Gaal a portion of humble pie in the wake of the Dutchman\xe2\x80\x99s unflattering, albeit fairly accurate, appraisal of the striker\xe2\x80\x99s abilities and place in the pecking order when he rubber-stamped his sale to Arsenal last September. </p> <p>It has been a season to forget for Manchester United, who have recently relied more on the shortcomings of Liverpool than their own good form to secure their place in Europe next season. A convincing display and accompanying win against Arsenal would prove a welcome end-of-season fillip to fans of an out-of-form team that can leapfrog their way into the Champions League group stages and hope Sunderland do them a favour next Wednesday to help keep them there. In his pre-match mutterings, Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Per Mertesacker has stressed the importance of Arsenal keeping Marouane Fellaini on a tight rein if they are to secure another win at Old Trafford. They seem to have managed it last time out, when the Belgian\xe2\x80\x99s performance was so underwhelming that his name didn\xe2\x80\x99t merit a single mention in the subsequent Guardian match report. BG</p> 8) Do Everton and West Ham really want to avoid the Europa League? <p>Wedged firmly into the middle of the table, there is nothing for West Ham United and Everton play for \xe2\x80\x93 except avoiding the Europa League, which both teams could qualify for by dint of the the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s fair play spot. West Ham and Everton are second and third in the fair play table behind Liverpool so could conceivably qualify for the most exhausting of European competitions as \xe2\x80\x9creward\xe2\x80\x9d for not kicking lumps out of everyone. It has led to much scurrilous rumouring that both sides will go into this game determined to make up for a season in the good books and that what will ensue will largely be a cloud of dust from which the odd boot, fist and \xe2\x80\x9cooyah\xe2\x80\x9d will emerge. But will it? Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez is a man who finds it impossible to be negative and he has already said the Europa League will be a good place to develop youngsters (take that Michel Platini!). While what better a sadistic parting gift could Sam Allardyce hand to a club that appear not to be renewing his contract than to deliver them a season that will begin with qualifying for a tournament they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to play in on 2 July? TB</p> 9) Can Hull\xe2\x80\x99s Tottenham old boys prove their former employer wrong? <p>Tottenham Hotspur\xe2\x80\x99s defeat against Stoke City last week, a performance for which they were described as having their flip-flops on but which might actually have improved had that been the case, may well have given Hull City some hope. Should Spurs fail to turn up again, perhaps Steve Bruce\xe2\x80\x99s side have some hope of escaping the drop. Either way, there should be plenty of motivation within the Hull camp. Not only do they have their Premier League survival to play for, but Michael Dawson, Tom Huddlestone and Jake Livermore must be determined to get one over on their former club. TB </p> 10) Bristol Rovers go toe-to-toe with Grimsby in a Game of Hope <p>Listen carefully and you can hear the high-pitched hum of entitled whining that is an ever-present soundtrack below the line in the comments section of football websites everywhere. More often than not, it emanates from football fans whose football problems are strictly first world: a misfiring \xc2\xa350m striker, a team that\xe2\x80\x99s come up woefully short in the Champions League or their squad of Premier League-winners not getting the credit they deserve from a conspiratorial media that is clearly peddling a sinister agenda. That kind of guff. </p> <p>Fans of clubs in the Conference can only dream of having such misery visited upon them on a regular basis and on Sunday, two teams from England\xe2\x80\x99s fifth tier will go toe-to-toe at Wembley with a precious place in the Football League up for grabs. Whatever the outcome between Grimsby Town and Bristol Rovers, one set of fans will surf home from Wembley on a tidal wave of elation, while the other will end the afternoon face down in a trough of utter despair. Of course fans of clubs at football\xe2\x80\x99s sharp end are used to and well able for despair in all its myriad forms. Between now and Sunday it\xe2\x80\x99s the almost unbearable hope that\xe2\x80\x99ll kill those who follow Rovers and Grimsby, so if you know anyone in either camp do make sure to enjoy the kind of misery supporters of bigger, richer and more successful clubs will never truly know.
