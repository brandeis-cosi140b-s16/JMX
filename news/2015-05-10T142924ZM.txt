b'Manchester City v QPR: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>Match report: Manchester City 6-0 QPR</p> <p>There were so many things that went badly for QPR today, but you have to say that Ramsey got his tactics all wrong, playing a 3-5-2. Under Harry Redknapp, QPR started the season with that formation and they struggled. It is a cruel bit of symmetry to see them finish the season in the same manner. They will play in the Championship next season and must make a complete overhaul of the squad in the summer: there are still too many old, overpaid players that appear to be coasting.</p> <p>City confirm their Champions League place with this win. They need one more point from their final two matches to effectively seal a top three finish and avoid a Champions League play-off. Sergio Aguero was the stand out performer, obviously, with his hat-trick: he is comfortably the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s top scorer with 25. </p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHow come Sergio wan\xe2\x80\x99t even nominated for PFA Player of the Year? Staggering, really...\xe2\x80\x9d emails Damon Burnard. Quite.</p> <p>Thanks for your emails and tweets. See you next time. Bye!</p>     Dejected QPR fan. Photograph: Alex Livesey/Getty Images  '
