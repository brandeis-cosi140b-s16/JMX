b'<p>Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o has completed a free transfer to Everton and could make his Goodison Park debut against his former club Chelsea on Saturday.</p> <p>The 33-year-old has signed a two-year contract with Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s side with the length of the deal on offer from Everton a factor in the striker\xe2\x80\x99s decision. Eto\xe2\x80\x99o had been earmarked for a move to Liverpool in the event of Brendan Rodgers cooling on Mario Balotelli but, with his former Internazionale team-mate sealing a \xc2\xa316m transfer to Anfield, he has moved to the other side of Stanley Park.</p> <p>Eto\xe2\x80\x99o, a Champions League winner with Barcelona (twice) and Internazionale, scored 12 goals in 34 appearances for Chelsea last season but was not offered an extension to his one-year contract at Stamford Bridge. Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho had expressed reservations over the Cameroon international\xe2\x80\x99s age during his time with Chelsea and their paths could cross on Saturday when the Londoners face Everton at Goodison.</p> <p>Mart\xc3\xadnez has been keen to strengthen his strike-force this season with Everton having the extra demands of a Europa League campaign and little back-up for their \xc2\xa328m record signing Romelu Lukaku. Arouna Kon\xc3\xa9 is still recovering from the knee injury that ruined his first season as an Everton player last year.</p> <p>Eto\xe2\x80\x99o had been seeking a weekly wage of six figures from Liverpool but, with Everton\xe2\x80\x99s highest-paid players earning around \xc2\xa375,000 a week, is expected to be on similar terms albeit with a signing on fee as a free agent and the security of a two-year deal.</p> <p>The four-times African footballer of the year, who passed his medical on Tuesday, said: \xe2\x80\x9cI have been very impressed by the style of play Everton adopt. I could see straight away that at this club I will have the opportunity to play football.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI had the chance to speak with the manager over the last few days and we agreed that this was what we would do.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was impressed with his enthusiasm but also by the knowledge of football that Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez carries, his vision of football and how he reads football. I still think I can learn a great deal from him here.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
