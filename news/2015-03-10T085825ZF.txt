b'Football transfer rumours: Manchester United to sign Saido Berahino?'


b'<p>These are lean times for Manchester United. Their trophy cabinet will be left gathering dust for consecutive seasons but fear not, the Rumour Mill has the solution to all their problems. And that solution will not cost \xc2\xa359.7m only to get sent off in their most important game of the season so far by pulling on the referee\xe2\x80\x99s shirt having been booked for diving seconds earlier.</p> <p>That solution is West Bromwich Albion\xe2\x80\x99s Saido Berahino. On Monday night he was at Old Trafford to watch Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s team slump to Arsenal and who could blame him if he thought: \xe2\x80\x9cI could do a job here.\xe2\x80\x9d The 21-year-old has, after all, scored 12 Premier League goals this season, three times as many as Falcao has managed. Ilkay Gundogan could also be on his way to Old Trafford and the Mill is excited to see him follow in the footsteps of Shinji Kagawa by securing a move back to Borussia Dortmund for a lesser fee a year later.</p> <p>Fresh from their first victory at United in a very long time indeed, Arsenal look like landing the Palermo striker Paulo Dybala on a \xc2\xa329.5m deal. He has been billed as the new Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero after an impressive spell in Serie A, which surely has nothing to do with him being Argentinian.</p> <p>Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s James Milner is interested in a trip abroad if it means more first-team football, with Roma, Milan and Internazionale among his suitors, and Glen Johnson could follow in his footsteps after turning down a reduced offer from Liverpool. Who will Brendan Rodgers replace him with? Dani Alves, of course. The Brazilian is out of contract at Barcelona at the end of the season and has long dreamt of swapping Barceloneta for the Mersey.</p> <p>Aware that John Terry and Gary Cahill are entering the end of their careers, Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho plans on strengthening their defence in the summer and the Madrid press reckon Rapha\xc3\xabl Varane is his No1 target. Real will be looking for almost \xc2\xa340m, though. First of all, Mourinho wants to take Morgan Schneiderlin from St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s, while Tottenham want to lure the impressive Toby Alderweireld from Southampton to north London. The Belgium defender is on loan from Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid and has been a key part of the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s best defence. But he was initially spotted by Paul Mitchell, the former head of recruitment who followed Mauricio Pochettino to White Hart Lane, and Spurs may flex their bigger financial muscles to Atl\xc3\xa9tico.</p> <p>Schneiderlin now looks more like to join Arsenal but, in some rare positive transfer news for Southampton supporters, they are among the favourites to land Javier Hern\xc3\xa1ndez, who has spent the season watching Real Madrid from the Bernab\xc3\xa9u bench, which is surely better than observing from the Old Trafford bench at the moment.</p> <p>And, finally, returning to United, Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Danny Welbeck has caught the eye of Louis \xe2\x80\xa6 oh, you can see where this is going.</p>'
