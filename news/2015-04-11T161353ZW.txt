b'West Bromwich Albion 2-3 Leicester City | Premier League match report'


b'<p>Behind twice and with their hopes of surviving waning by the minute, Jamie Vardy gave Leicester City a massive boost in their battle to stay in the Premier League thanks to a stunning breakaway goal two minutes into added time that draws West Bromwich Albion deeper into the scrap. Suddenly the gap to safety is three points and with a favourable run-in, Nigel Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s team could well stay up.</p> <p>Just as the game seemed to be petering out to a draw, Vardy robbed a dawdling Gareth McAuley of possession near halfway and drove forward before finding the bottom left corner of Boaz Myhill\xe2\x80\x99s goal. The away end exploded with joy, the boos from the home fans magnified the increasing fears that Tony Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s side are too facing a battle to the end.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an exceptional goal,\xe2\x80\x9d Pearson said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we can\xe2\x80\x99t get carried away. It\xe2\x80\x99s great to get back-to-back wins but we\xe2\x80\x99ve got an awful lot to do.\xe2\x80\x9d Five of their remaining seven games are at home and Chelsea are the only top-six side left to face. Pearson continued to play their chances down, though. \xe2\x80\x9cUltimately we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do it ourselves. It\xe2\x80\x99s a big ask.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>West Brom, who remain seven points above the bottom three but face a daunting set of fixtures that includes the top three and Liverpool, had designated this fixture Jeff Astle Day, in memory of the striker who died from chronic traumatic encephalopathy in 2002. The Albion players wore a commemorative kit in honour of the 1968 FA Cup winner, numbered from 1-11 even though Darren Fletcher donned 11 in centre midfield, and the now customary ovation in the ninth minute was particularly moving with a mosaic at the Brummie End displaying the simple message: \xe2\x80\x9cAstle King\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>By that point, the hosts were in front courtesy of Fletcher and the goal decision system, after the captain arrived at the near post to head Chris Brunt\xe2\x80\x99s corner home. Kasper Schmeichel\xe2\x80\x99s flap could not keep it out and despite the attempts of Esteban Cambiasso to clear off the line, Martin Atkinson checked his technology and signalled that the ball had crossed fully.</p> <p>Cambiasso was integral as Leicester regained parity with their first chance of note in the 20th minute, though, as his free-kick from a defensive position was knocked down by Leonardo Ulloa and David Nugent brushed off Craig Dawson before tucking the ball neatly past Myhill.</p> <p>They were only level for eight minutes, however. Chris Brunt\xe2\x80\x99s whipped cross from the left was only half-cleared by Jeffrey Schlupp, under pressure from Brown Ideye, and Craig Gardner, left all alone near the penalty spot, acrobatically sent the rebound into Schmeichel\xe2\x80\x99s bottom left corner via a Wes Morgan deflection.</p> <p>Leicester finished the half strongly and Ulloa spurned a glorious chance three minutes before the break when blazing over from eight yards following a cute header from Nugent.</p> <p>Pearson brought Marcin Wasilewski in for Ritchie De Laet at the interval, a move which allowed Schlupp, who started at left-back, licence to roam forward, but it was on the opposite flank where Leicester looked more likely to penetrate. Marc Albrighton cut in front in from the right shortly after the hour only for his goal-bound effort to divert for a corner off Lescott\xe2\x80\x99s outstretched leg.</p>  <p> Related: Tottenham Hotspur 0-1 Aston Villa | Premier League match report </p>   <p>West Brom invited the pressure on. They looked agitated and rushed in possession, typified by Brunt banishing what should have been a simple pass across the field into the stands with 20 minutes to go.</p> <p>Leicester sensed an opportunity and began piling forward. Riyad Mahrez sent a free-kick over, Morgan headed tamely wide from a Cambiasso corner before they finally made it 2-2 with a shade more than 10 minutes remaining. Again it came from a clever Cambiasso dead-ball. Instead of pumping a corner in, he spotted Albrighton unmarked on the left edge of the box and played it short to the winger. Albrighton fizzed into the back post, Nugent hooked across the face of goal, Wasilewski headed on and Robert Huth was on hand to add the finishing touch.</p> <p>The final 10 minutes were frenetic and Schlupp had genuine claims for a penalty turned down after being bundled over by Dawson. But then it was Vardy time. He pick-pocketed McAuley on halfway, raced forward and after bamboozling Lescott, sent a low finish across goal and in. \xe2\x80\x9cGareth was playing like a right-winger,\xe2\x80\x9d Pulis said, the anxiety creeping in. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t do that at this level. It\xe2\x80\x99s really disappointing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Sunderland 1-4 Crystal Palace | Premier League match report </p> '
