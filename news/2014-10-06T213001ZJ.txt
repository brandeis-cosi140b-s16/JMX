b'John Terry: Chelsea must maintain focus and form after international break'


b'<p>John Terry has warned his Chelsea team-mates against complacency born of their five-point lead at the top of the Premier League and urged the team to maintain their focus and form once the topflight campaign resumes after the international break.</p> <p>The impressive nature of their derby victory over Arsenal on Sunday had prompted the visiting goalkeeper, Wojciech Szczesny, to acknowledge \xe2\x80\x9cthe brilliance\xe2\x80\x9d mustered by the leaders in securing the 2-0 success at Stamford Bridge to restore that eye-catching advantage at the summit. Chelsea are the only unbeaten team in the division having dropped just two points, at the champions Manchester City, though the captain is wary of the threat still posed by the pack when they resume their challenge at Crystal Palace later this month.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cClearly it\xe2\x80\x99s not over,\xe2\x80\x9d Terry said. \xe2\x80\x9cOther teams have been in that position before. It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to have the lead, but when you\xe2\x80\x99re at the top everyone wants to shoot you down, from top to bottom. That\xe2\x80\x99s the good thing about the Premier League and why everyone loves it. Teams are out to get us because we are at the top and playing well at the moment. The international break has come and we need to come back and maintain our form after that as well. It\xe2\x80\x99s very important we do that.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s obviously better to be leading than being behind. But when you\xe2\x80\x99re behind \xe2\x80\x93 and we\xe2\x80\x99ve been there \xe2\x80\x93 you have something to fight for, something to chase. When you\xe2\x80\x99re at the top and have a five-point cushion, you\xe2\x80\x99re just hoping a couple of the teams behind you slip up again and that increases it to eight or nine. If that happens it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of points to give up early on. All we can do is keep winning and wait for those teams to slip up.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s campaign has been driven by the impact made by their two major summer signings, Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas and Diego Costa, who have made a staggering impact since arriving from Barcelona and Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid respectively. Both have joined up with the Spain squad before their Euro 2016 qualifiers against Slovakia and Luxembourg, with Terry apparently unconcerned by the state of the nine-goal forward\xe2\x80\x99s hamstring, an injury which has been giving Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho sleepless nights in recent weeks.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure where that\xe2\x80\x99s coming from,\xe2\x80\x9d Terry said when asked about the thigh complaint that has hampered Costa since he aggravated the injury in his country\xe2\x80\x99s friendly defeat to France last month. \xe2\x80\x9cHe certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t showing that against me in training. He is training every day, he looks sharp, he looks angry, he looks aggressive. He\xe2\x80\x99s fit at the moment and that\xe2\x80\x99s the main thing. It\xe2\x80\x99s been so important that the new guys have hit the ground running. Cesc knew the league, but for Diego to come in and score the goals he has and be the handful that he is\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 he\xe2\x80\x99s been a nightmare for defenders.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Costa\xe2\x80\x99s goal \xe2\x80\x93 his ninth in seven league games \xe2\x80\x93 had killed off Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s challenge on Sunday with a first league loss this season something of a reality check for the visitors, despite an improved performance on the 6-0 drubbing to the same opponents back in March. Szczesny said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was an even game, but Chelsea have an ability to keep clean sheets at home and I thought they were very good, they took their chances with two brilliant moments. One, a brilliant run from Hazard which led to the penalty. On the second goal, the ball from Cesc and the finish \xe2\x80\xa6 Sometimes you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to take your hat off to the brilliance of the opposition. You can\xe2\x80\x99t say we\xe2\x80\x99ve played badly. It\xe2\x80\x99s just that we came up against a very strong side, probably the favourites to win the Premier League at this point.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLast year it was a freak result at Stamford Bridge,\xe2\x80\x9d Jack Wilshere said. \xe2\x80\x9cNo team, not even a team in the bottom half, should be losing 6-0. But this year, in the big games we really feel we\xe2\x80\x99re closer. Last year, in the big matches, the game was almost over after 20 minutes. We were 1-0 down, or two down, and when you go behind at places like Chelsea it\xe2\x80\x99s really tough. This year we were really focused, we kept it tight and you can\xe2\x80\x99t really plan for a bit of a magic from Eden Hazard. Up until then we\xe2\x80\x99d defended well and even created a few opportunities ourselves, so we feel like we are getting better as a defensive unit.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The same might apply to Chelsea, whose early season sloppiness at the back \xe2\x80\x93 masked by the number of goals they were plundering at the other end \xe2\x80\x93 has been eradicated and the defence having since mustered three successive clean sheets. Arsenal did not manage a shot on target all afternoon. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone was questioning the defence early on in the season, but it\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen,\xe2\x80\x9d Terry said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are so many good teams and individuals in the league, we are going to concede goals. The important thing is we have goals in us. We have had a few clean sheets on the bounce, defensively we have been doing very well, not just the back four, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also people like Eden, Andr\xc3\xa9 [Sch\xc3\xbcrrle] coming back and able to go forward as well. That\xe2\x80\x99s the key. We are more attacking this year, but defensively we are now very solid.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
