b'Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s Manchester United lack Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s knack for escapology'


b'<p>Stuart James</p> <p>It was the sort of game the Manchester United of old would have won. Yet those famed acts of escapology, such as the one United pulled off at Villa Park two years ago when Sir Alex Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s side fought back from being 2-0 down to win 3-2, are conspicuous by their absence. United have failed to win any of the seven matches in which they have gone behind this season. Not even playing with an extra man for the final 25 minutes made a difference here.</p> <p>What a contrast to the 2012\xe2\x80\x9113 title-winning team who had collected 15 points from losing positions by the time they triumphed at Villa Park in the middle of November and also repeated the trick three times in Europe. Those powers of recovery became part of the club\xe2\x80\x99s DNA during the Ferguson era and whatever the reasons behind it \xe2\x80\x93 unshakeable belief, good fortune, star quality or maybe the fear of God that the Scot put into his players \xe2\x80\x93 United need to rediscover the happy knack.</p> <p>This season United have earned only three points when trying to come from behind \xe2\x80\x93 against Swansea City, Leicester City, West Bromwich Albion, Chelsea, Manchester City and now Villa. The less said about the other match when they were playing catch-up \xe2\x80\x93 the 4-0 defeat at MK Dons in the Capital One Cup \xe2\x80\x93 the better.</p> <p>In the past a United equaliser early in the second half would have sent shudders down the spines of opponents and fuelled a sense of inevitability on the pitch and in the stands, about the onslaught that would follow. Not here. Radamel Falcao\xe2\x80\x99s close-range header galvanised Aston Villa as much as it did United. Even with a numerical advantage following Gabriel Agbonlahor\xe2\x80\x99s extremely harsh dismissal, United were unable to cut through their opponents.</p> <p>So much of United\xe2\x80\x99s possession was pedestrian and laboured, there was little in the way of pace or penetration and it was alarming \xe2\x80\x93 albeit absolutely spot-on \xe2\x80\x93 to hear Louis van Gaal bemoaning a lack of creativity in a starting XI that included Robin van Persie, Falcao, Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata, Antonio Valencia and Ashley Young, with \xc3\x81ngel Di Mar\xc3\xada coming off the bench.</p> <p>The suspicion remains that Van Gaal is still unsure of the best way to set his team up and deploy all that attacking talent.</p> <p>Falcao\xe2\x80\x99s goal \xe2\x80\x93 only his second for United \xe2\x80\x93 should do him the power of good, and Young made a couple of decent raids down the left flank, including his fine cross for the Colombian\xe2\x80\x99s bullet-header. Mata was peripheral while Valencia and Van Persie were withdrawn.</p> <p>Rooney played a couple of superb, raking diagonal passes and one glorious through-ball that was clipped first time on the half-volley for Van Persie to run on to in the second half.</p> <p>Yet it is hard to escape the feeling that United lose more than they gain by playing the third-highest goalscorer in the club\xe2\x80\x99s history so deep that at times he is picking up the ball from central defenders.</p> <p>While the England captain described the two points dropped as a \xe2\x80\x9cmissed opportunity\xe2\x80\x9d, Van Gaal went further and said it was the sort of result that may cost United the title when they look back and reflect at the end of the season.</p> <p>Seven points behind Chelsea and Manchester City having played a game more than Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s team, United have left themselves no margin for error over the festive period when they host Newcastle before tricky trips to White Hart Lane and the Britannia Stadium.</p> <p>For all Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s frustration and United\xe2\x80\x99s shortcomings, Villa deserve credit for a spirited performance.</p> <p>Traditionally obliging opponents for United \xe2\x80\x93 Villa have failed to beat them at home in the league in 19 years \xe2\x80\x93 Paul Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s side were resolute in defence, worked tirelessly in midfield and offered a sporadic threat on the counterattack. Jores Okore was outstanding at the back while Christian Benteke led the line superbly and scored a fine goal to put Villa ahead.</p> <p>The only downside for Villa was Agbonlahor\xe2\x80\x99s straight red card for a foul on Young \xe2\x80\x93 a desperately poor decision by Lee Mason, the referee, and one that will surely be overturned on appeal. Lambert revealed that Young had told the Villa goalkeeper Brad Guzan that he was the guilty party.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI hear this argument: excessive force and all that. The two of them went for a fair challenge,\xe2\x80\x9d the Villa manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen their lad [Young] says he fouled Gabby, that\xe2\x80\x99s where it falls down.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Man of the match Jores Okore (Aston Villa)</p>'
