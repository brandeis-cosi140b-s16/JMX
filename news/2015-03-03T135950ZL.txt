b'Louis van Gaal confident despite Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s tough fixtures'


b'<p>Louis van Gaal is not concerned about Manchester United having to play five of the six teams around them at the top of the Premier League as the manager attempts to lead the club to a Champions League position in the closing part of the season.</p> <p>In United\xe2\x80\x99s final 11 matches they face Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool, Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal, yet Van Gaal pointed to the club\xe2\x80\x99s first 12 matches of the campaign in which they recovered from a poor start to reach third place, having played Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal during that sequence.</p> <p>Asked if United\xe2\x80\x99s was the hardest run-in, Van Gaal said: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, because you said that also in front of the games in the beginning of the season and then we were 13th, do you remember that? And in spite of all the games that we had in front of us we were third. It was 22 November.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Gaal replaced \xc3\x81ngel di Mar\xc3\xada at half-time of Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s 2-0 win over Sunderland but the manager believes the forward\xe2\x80\x99s continuing struggle for form is because time is required for him to adjust.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt counts for all the players that we have bought, the first season is always difficult,\xe2\x80\x9d the Dutchman said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have explained that in the press conference after the match. You can see it to every player we have bought: Shaw, Blind, Herrera, Falcao and also Di Mar\xc3\xada. For me it is not a big surprise, it is more a big surprise when [if] he [had] adapted as quickly as possible.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn the Netherlands, Spain and Germany I had the same experience with players. We have to give him time as I have already said, not just for him but to all the other players \xe2\x80\x93 we shall wait and see.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>United travel to Newcastle United on Wednesday evening in fourth place, two points ahead of Liverpool. Michael Carrick was on the bench for the victory over Sunderland as he works his way back from a muscle injury but is unlikely to start at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think it is too early,\xe2\x80\x9d the manager said of the midfielder. \xe2\x80\x9cHe trained three sessions with us, I think [and] because of the players we didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring with us he was in the 18 [on Saturday]. As a sub you can play 20 minutes, that he can do. He has the experience, he is also a captain.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
