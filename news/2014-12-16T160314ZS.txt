b'Steve Clarke appointed as new manager of Reading to replace Nigel Adkins'


b'<p>Reading have moved swiftly to replace the sacked Nigel Adkins by naming Steve Clarke as their new manager on a two-and-a-half-year contract, ending the Scot\xe2\x80\x99s 12-month exile from the game.</p> <p>Clarke was dismissed as head coach at West Bromwich Albion last December, despite finishing eighth the previous season, after leading the team to only seven wins in 34 Premier League games in 2013. The 51-year-old had been in the frame to take over at Crystal Palace this season only to lose out to Neil Warnock at the last, but now returns to the dugout in the second tier.</p> <p>Reading are 16th in the Championship and still reeling from Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s 6-1 thrashing at Birmingham City. The team\xe2\x80\x99s form has deteriorated to the extent they have won only three of their past 15 games in all competitions, a ninth defeat in that time having curtailed Adkins\xe2\x80\x99 tenure. Yet Clarke has pointed to the clear potential at the Madejski Stadium, with the club\xe2\x80\x99s hierarchy attracted as much to his experiences as an assistant manager at Chelsea, West Ham and Liverpool as his spell in charge at The Hawthorns.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe comes with a CV of the very highest order and I look forward to moving back up the table with him in charge,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Royals\xe2\x80\x99 co-chairman, Sir John Madejski. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has been a difficult period for all concerned, but now we can look forwards. Nigel Adkins worked tirelessly to achieve success, sadly it did not work out for him but we wish him, his family and staff well for the future. Now we look forward to a new era under Steve\xe2\x80\x99s stewardship and I, for one, am excited about this new beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Reading have adjusted their outlay to comply with the Football League\xe2\x80\x99s new financial fair play regulations but the manager will have funds to spend in January. An agreement is in place in principle to secure the Palace striker Glenn Murray, who has been on loan at the club since August, for around \xc2\xa31.5m with Clarke to assess the current playing staff before deciding whether to enter the market further.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe can strengthen in January,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarke said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to understand the constrictions with FFP, which the club have explained to me, and there aren\xe2\x80\x99t millions and millions and millions of pounds to spend. You have to prudent and careful.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut those already at the club will be given first crack it, because they deserve that. There is real potential here, and the ambition is to be back in the Premier League. Personally, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing to prove. My time at West Brom was successful. Since I\xe2\x80\x99ve left, things have not improved there.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Clarke\xe2\x80\x99s first game in charge will be ahome fixture against sixth-placed Watford on Saturday.</p>'
