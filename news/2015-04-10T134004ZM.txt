b'Manuel Pellegrini insists Manchester City are not a mess before derby'


b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini has claimed Manchester City are \xe2\x80\x9cnot a disaster or mess\xe2\x80\x9d and insisted there is not a great deal wrong with the champions\xc2\xa0despite his side having lost three of their past five matches before Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s derby with Manchester United.</p> <p>Vincent Kompany faces a late fitness\xc2\xa0test and Wilfried Bony and Stevan Jovetic are out of the 169th meeting between the clubs due to injury, but Pellegrini is confident his team are functioning well. He did, however, admit more goals are required.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI understand we are not having the results we need playing away. 2015 is not a good year for us \xe2\x80\x93 before that we were the best team playing away,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe lost the last three games, especially the last two with two goals\xc2\xa0in set-pieces, against Burnley and Palace. We hope\xc2\xa0we continue keeping the good things we are doing because we are not a disaster, we\xe2\x80\x99re not a mess. We are doing a lot of things\xc2\xa0well.</p> <p>Regarding his own future as manager, which is in doubt with City trailing Premier League leaders Chelsea by nine points, Pellegrini believes he has the backing of the whole club. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not talking about my future because it is not important,\xe2\x80\x9d the Chilean said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am just thinking about the game against Manchester United. I feel everyone supports me at the club. We have to improve because we are not winning but we are the most attacking team, the team that has most possession of the ball. We don\xe2\x80\x99t concede many goals so the team is working to score.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe players are happy in the way we work and the way we play. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any problems inside the club but you never know what will happen in August and at the end of the season. If you ask me, I am not afraid because I think we are in the correct way but a bad moment.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of those players who are injured or a doubt for Sunday, Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cStevan Jovetic has a muscle injury. Bony had a problem the day before the game against Crystal Palace, he twisted his ankle and his knee so he will not be ready for this game. [Dedryck] Boyata has a problem in his knee. Kompany \xe2\x80\x93 we will assess him tomorrow [due to] what happened with the problem in the last game. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t work this week in a normal way. We will see if he can play or not. It is always better to play with Kompany but if for different reasons he cannot play we have a squad and he must be replaced.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
