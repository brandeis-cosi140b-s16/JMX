b'Kevin De Bruyne will not leave Wolfsburg in January, says agent'


b'<p>Kevin De Bruyne\xe2\x80\x99s agent has ruled out a move for the Wolfsburg midfielder in the January transfer window and believes it would take an astronomical offer to persuade them to sell him.</p> <p>The Belgium international De Bruyne, who moved to Germany from Chelsea last January for around \xc2\xa318m having made just six starts in England, has been in superb form for Wolfsburg this season as they have risen to second in the Bundesliga table behind Bayern Munich.</p> <p>The 23-year-old already has 12 assists and six goals and was rated as the only world-class attacking midfielder in the Bundesliga by the respected magazine Kicker this month. That has led to rumours that several clubs including Bayern Munich, Manchester United and Arsenal are interested in signing him but his agent, Patrick De Koster, has insisted De Bruyne will not be leaving in the immediate future.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere is always going to be interest when things have been going so well but I can tell you Kevin is happy where he is,\xe2\x80\x9d De Koster told Guardian sport. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter a difficult time at Chelsea he just wanted to be playing regularly. Now that is happening and Kevin is totally focused on helping Wolfsburg to qualify for the Champions League.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut after that, who knows? England and Spain are both interesting championships or he could decide that another season in Germany is for the best. But it could be difficult because Wolfsburg paid a lot of money to sign Kevin and there are only a few clubs who could afford the price they will want.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>De Bruyne attended the funeral of his former Wolfsburg team-mate Junior Malanda on Tuesday in Brussels, who was killed in a car crash earlier this month just before the Belgian pair had been due to fly to a club training camp in South Africa.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe is still in shock,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted De Koster.</p>  <p> Related: Transfer news: Juan Cuadrado lined up to replace Mohamed Salah at Chelsea \xe2\x80\x93 live! </p> '
