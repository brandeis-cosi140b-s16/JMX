b'Manchester United calculate the cost of Cristiano Ronaldo\xe2\x80\x99s return: \xc2\xa3140m'


b'<p>Manchester United will have to pay at least \xc2\xa3140m to bring Cristiano Ronaldo back to Old Trafford with Real Madrid reportedly ready to cash in on a move that will also alert Chelsea, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain, and other European heavyweights.</p> <p>It is understood that around 18 months ago Ronaldo and his advisors spoke to the majority of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s blue riband clubs regarding potentially leaving Real. In the event he signed a fresh deal last September with the Spanish giants that made him the world\xe2\x80\x99s highest paid footballer.</p> <p>Ronaldo earns \xe2\x82\xac21m a year, which is \xc2\xa316.4m or \xc2\xa3315,384 a week, with Real paying all of his 52% tax. He costs the Spanish club \xc2\xa334.1m a season. Given his pay equates to \xc2\xa3693,844 gross under the UK\xe2\x80\x99s 45% tax bracket for high earners, Ronaldo would have to agree a sizeable pay cut on his basic terms if he were to return to United.</p> <p>United could further boost his take-home pay by offering him a lucrative image rights deal and other sizeable commercial incentives beyond the normal bonuses awarded for successful on-field performance.</p> <p>The \xc2\xa3140m cost for United \xe2\x80\x93 or any prospective suitor \xe2\x80\x93 would be the transfer fee of around \xc2\xa360m and his basic wage, should he agree to around \xc2\xa3380,000 a-week as a gross figure, which on a four-year contract amounts to \xc2\xa379m.</p> <p>While Real would want \xc2\xa380m to try to recoup all of the fee paid to United five years ago for Ronaldo, any interested club would hope to agree a smaller sum. Wayne Rooney is United\xe2\x80\x99s highest paid player on \xc2\xa3300,000 per week. Given Ronaldo\xe2\x80\x99s ability, which places him in at least a class above Rooney, and his pedigree as a double Fifa world player of the year and Real\xe2\x80\x99s record goalscorer, United would be prepared to break their pay structure to offer him nearer to \xc2\xa3400,000 a-week.</p> <p>Ed Woodward, United\xe2\x80\x99s executive vice-chairman, would be confident of extracting the maximum return if Ronaldo was bought. The forward has the highest following of any athlete on Twitter, greeting the reaching of 30m followers on Wednesday by tweeting: \xe2\x80\x9cWow! Reached the 30 million followers on Twitter, it\xe2\x80\x99s amazing. Thanks everyone.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ronaldo\xe2\x80\x99s ability to sell shirts and global appeal would also allow United to ensure the transfer would be a financial \xe2\x80\x93 as well as footballing \xe2\x80\x93 success.</p> <p>With the Portuguese turning 30 in February, Real have decided the end of the season will be time to cash in on an asset who will have three years left on his contract by the summer of 2015.</p> <p>Since signing in 2009, Ronaldo has continually spoken of his affection for Real. Having scoring the 25th hat-trick of his glittering Real career \xe2\x80\x93 a club record \xe2\x80\x93 in the 5-1 win over Elche, Ronaldo was once more asked about a return to United.</p> <p>He said: \xe2\x80\x9cThey are all speculations about my future. My future is Madrid. I\xe2\x80\x99m happy this season is going well and my future I will not speak about, it does not make sense.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Yet with Real revealing the club is \xc2\xa3400m in debt the sale of Ronaldo next close season would make financial sense as he enters his thirties ahead of an inevitable physical decline.</p> <p>Last Friday Louis van Gaal, the United manager, admitted he would be interested in buying Ronaldo.</p> <p>Regarding any competition for his signature, it is thought City are not minded to buy Ronaldo, while Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho described his relationship with the player as non-existent. Bayern Munich may not be able to afford him and PSG may struggle to convince the 29-year-old he should join as French football is not considered on a par with Europe\xe2\x80\x99s best domestic competitions.</p>'
