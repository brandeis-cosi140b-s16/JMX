b'Wayne Rooney: thanks for the goals but not for the waning influence | Michael Cox'


b'<p>A month into a campaign where Wayne Rooney has been named captain of club and country, questions remain about his precise role in both sides. Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s signings of \xc3\x81ngel di Mar\xc3\xada and Radamel Falcao provide Louis van Gaal with other top-class attacking options, while it increasingly seems Rooney is crowbarred into the England side at the expense of overall cohesion.</p> <p>In fairness, while Rooney was not in spectacular form at the World Cup, he was not one of England\xe2\x80\x99s worst performers either. He created Daniel Sturridge\xe2\x80\x99s equaliser against Italy with a fine run and cross, before scoring England\xe2\x80\x99s only other goal of the tournament against Uruguay.</p> <p>In terms of goalscoring, Rooney remains consistent: he has reached double figures in 10 consecutivePremier League seasons, a truly outstanding record. Nevertheless, it is fascinating thatwhile United have won the title in half of those seasons, Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s best four goalscoringcampaigns have come when others have triumphed \xe2\x80\x93 Manchester City twice and Chelsea twice. Perhaps that tells the story: what is best for Rooney is not always best for his side.</p> <p>At international level, there is a similar feeling. Rooney is now on 41 England goals, but Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s 1-0 victory over Norway was a microcosm of the situation \xe2\x80\x93 Rooney scored the only goal from the penalty spot and therefore found his name in the headlines yet again, but England looked most lively after he was substituted, with 20 minutes remaining.</p> <p>That allowed Roy Hodgson to change system, playing Daniel Sturridge and Danny Welbeck upfront together, with Raheem Sterling at the head of a midfield diamond, where he had excelled for Liverpool in their 3-0 thrashing of Tottenham last weekend. There was greater pace in England\xe2\x80\x99s attack, neater combinations between the lines and more players in advance of the ball, giving the midfielders options.</p> <p>Even when Rooney was on the pitch, he was not involved in England\xe2\x80\x99s best moves. Club combinations came to the fore: Sterling and Sturridge twice interchanged passes excellently, then Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain played a neat one-two. England\xe2\x80\x99s best passingmoves were played around Rooney, rather than through him, and for a No10, that is a damning indictment of his minimal influence.</p> <p>In truth, Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s best position for England might be as the primary striker, the role he developed into during the 2009-10 campaign for United, but has seldom played since. However, the fine club form of Sturridge means that position is not available, and shoving Sturridge out wide is an unhappy compromise.</p> <p>Rooney can be fielded wide, but in England\xe2\x80\x99s opening World Cup fixture, he was put on the left and failed to track Italy\xe2\x80\x99s right-back Matteo Darmian, leaving Leighton Baines exposed. Worryingly, Rooney was only playing there to free him from the defensive responsibility of tracking Andrea Pirlo, something he was not capable of during Euro 2012. Not only has Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s creative potential declined, his tactical discipline has vanished too.</p> <p>Strangely, the Rooney problem will not be critical over the next 18 months \xe2\x80\x93 in such a weak qualification group England should defeat minnows with a minimum of fuss, the central midfielders should be able to command matches as a duo, and Rooney can concentrate on goalscoring.</p> <p>Against stronger opposition, however, England will continue to look fragmented. By Euro 2016, Rooney will probably be England\xe2\x80\x99s all-time record goalscorer, but Hodgson will be faced with the same old dilemma about how to use him.</p>'
