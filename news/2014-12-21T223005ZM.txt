b'Manuel Pellegrini: Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98miracle\xe2\x80\x99 form all down to hard work'


b'<p>There was a touch of wryness in Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmiracle\xe2\x80\x9d description of Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s reeling in of Chelsea, who three weeks ago had led the Premier League champions by nine points.</p> <p>That was on 29 November and though City had a game in hand at that point there was a real prospect of Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s team making this season\xe2\x80\x99s title tilt a procession. Instead, following this canter of a 3-0 win over Crystal Palace City are now level on 39 points with Chelsea, separated by a goal difference of one, with the west London club travelling to Stoke City on Monday evening.</p> <p>The manager was posed the question of how seriously Chelsea will take City\xe2\x80\x99s championship defence and, given the chance to make a point to the team\xe2\x80\x99s critics, Pellegrini did it with a smile: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what Chelsea will think. I know three weeks ago we were nine points behind and close to elimination from the Champions League and we were a team that depends just on Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero. So I think that maybe this is a miracle. But the miracle has a name \xe2\x80\x93 that is work.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>This was, indeed, a victory without the lethal Argentinian striker, who struck 19 times in 21 appearances before suffering the knee injury that rules him out until next month. It was also a win with no frontline goalscorer at all, as Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic are nursing problems and the 18-year-old Jos\xc3\xa9 \xc3\x81ngel Pozo was ill.</p> <p>Instead, Pellegrini fielded James Milner as a kind of false No9, asked by the Chilean to create space for David Silva, Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 and their other midfield cohorts to run into and score.</p> <p>It worked like a dream. Silva, who does not score quite enough for such a sublime talent, finished with two \xe2\x80\x93 on 49 and 61 minutes \xe2\x80\x93 while Tour\xc3\xa9 added his seventh of the campaign, a late rocket after Milner\xe2\x80\x99s fine surge along the left.</p> <p>Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you review what we did last season, a lot of goals were scored by midfielders and full-backs. We have a style of play where we involve all of the players in attacking and after that we also try to have all the players defending. It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to play without a striker but I assure you we had a whole week to prepare where we practised at creating the space, knowing Crystal Palace were a difficult team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Despite the success of the false No9 shape, the Chilean is not keen to use it again soon. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s a system we\xe2\x80\x99ll adopt in the future,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis team works very hard during the week so we can change our style of play. Normally it is better for me to play with one striker or maybe two strikers in some moments. So it\xe2\x80\x99s important to have the capacity to change the style of play in one week.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Asked if there was any coincidence that City\xe2\x80\x99s run of eight victories on the bounce included the catalyst of an unexpected win over Bayern Munich , much like last season\xe2\x80\x99s similar sequence (taking in a 3-2 victory in Bavaria last December), Pellegrini again pulled up the questioner.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhy is it \xe2\x80\x98unexpected\xe2\x80\x99? Bayern Munich both years was important for us because it proves we can also play really well in the Champions League,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe try to win as many points as we can in the Premier League because, I repeat, both competitions have the same importance for us. It\xe2\x80\x99s very important to do well in the Champions League but not leaving the Premier League out \xe2\x80\x93 the possibility to win the title.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Although Neil Warnock had a fair case when describing James McArthur\xe2\x80\x99s disallowed goal for offside as a disgraceful decision \xe2\x80\x93 it came at 2-0 \xe2\x80\x93 City were worthy victors.</p> <p>City\xe2\x80\x99s surge up the table to seriously challenge Chelsea comes despite the club working within a maximum \xc2\xa349m net transfer spend imposed by Uefa due to financial fair play irregularities, which Pellegrini admits is a hindrance. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have restrictions you give a lot of advantage to other teams. I think if you want to be a competitive team you cannot give an advantage to other teams,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>Jovetic, who has a hamstring complaint, and Vincent Kompany, the City captain, who has muscular problems, will be assessed before their side\xe2\x80\x99s Boxing Day trip to West Bromwich Albion.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe will see during the week whether they can be fit for Friday,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pellegrini. Of Kompany, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult to be absolutely out of the problem with muscle injuries. He\xe2\x80\x99ll try to play again as soon as he can. But the player and me will have the last word to see if he can.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Man of the match David Silva (Manchester City)</p>'
