b'GET YOUR SPAIN END-OF-ERA BINGO CARDS AT THE READY <p>Slovakia is no place to grind to a halt in October. One day the Fiver promises to bore you with a tale about being stranded at a motorway petrol station many miles north-east of Bratislava in the middle of a long, dark autumn night of the soul back in our days of roaming free from the hovel but \xe2\x80\xa6 well, that\xe2\x80\x99s actually the tale. Somebody picked us up in the end \xe2\x80\x93 and it\xe2\x80\x99s Spain who need a similar service this time around. An era has ended. Again. Just as it did three months ago. And last night, anyone with a Spain end-of-era bingo card would have found themselves rolling in [Fiver grasps for exotic yet relevant currency denomination before remembering Slovakia is in the eurozone] euros. Sixty-six per cent possession! An Iker Casillas howler! Diego Costa taking \xe2\x80\x98False 9\xe2\x80\x99 too literally! Vicente del Clouseau looking morose \xe2\x80\x93 or happy \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to tell!</p> <p>The veteran detective\xe2\x80\x99s side should have won the game, in fairness, and looked as if they would until being caught by what is known only in football as a sucker punch. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99re on a bad run,\xe2\x80\x9d he averred afterwards. Four defeats in six say otherwise but, yes, one man\xe2\x80\x99s Euromeat is another\xe2\x80\x99s Europoison because all that last night\xe2\x80\x99s game really did was increase the likelihood that Spain and Slovakia meet again in France 20 months from now. When Michel Platini had his Definitely A Good Idea to expand the European Championship, this was what he had in mind \xe2\x80\x93 bringing the big and the not-so-big closer together without putting any noses out of joint. Spain\xe2\x80\x99s has been bloodied but they won\xe2\x80\x99t be slipping from the consciousness any time soon, the only real tension in their qualifying campaign being in wondering how long this has delayed the inevitable.</p> <p>The Euro 2016 qualifiers are for the Slovakias, the Hungarys, the Bulgarias, the Finlands and (hides) the Scotlands, all of whom will win and lose against each other with maddening inconsistency while claiming the odd scalp. It will make for some pleasing battles for third place \xe2\x80\x93 a play-off passport for all but one \xe2\x80\x93 and four years ago such a finish would comfortably have allowed you three defeats. Everyone has some cake now, but the way in which the threshold between success and failure has been redrawn makes us question exactly how we should define either. It\xe2\x80\x99s not how you do, it\xe2\x80\x99s whose criteria tell you how you\xe2\x80\x99ve done. It\xe2\x80\x99s the footballing equivalent of an arbitrary, vainly constructed colonial border drawn up over a sweat-inducing Victorian dinner on a 19th century map.</p> <p>So while it\xe2\x80\x99s probable that Del Clouseau was deliberately yielding little last night, perhaps he is right. Perhaps a bad run is when you don\xe2\x80\x99t qualify and when you haven\xe2\x80\x99t just beaten Macedonia \xe2\x80\x93 now perfectly capable of facing you down in the summer of \xe2\x80\x9816 \xe2\x80\x93 by five goals to one. Who knows? Spain certainly need some surgery, excellent as Slovakia were, and it feels a little strange that it won\xe2\x80\x99t make a difference to their fate over the next year and a half. There is a sense that we\xe2\x80\x99re all being dragged up or down to each other\xe2\x80\x99s level; whatever the quality of the vehicle that picks Spain up from their mishap in Zilina, it\xe2\x80\x99ll have plenty of time to splutter home.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Nick Ames is in the Euro 2016 qualifier hot seat tonight.

It made me think of another furious Irishman: Taffin. Now imagine the pay-off from each of Roy\xe2\x80\x99s anecdotes delivered like that. The Ferg stuff. The Robbie Savage line. Everything Roy says, I imagine, is roared out like this\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Robert Young.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMay I be the first of 1,057 Skittles vodka pedants to express concern at Olcan Shaw\xe2\x80\x99s brewing methods (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters). The \xe2\x80\x98huge head of foam\xe2\x80\x99 he refers to is pure vegetable fat from the Skittles, which cannot dissolve in alcohol. The correct harvesting process is to separate the colours, funnel each colour-group into its own bottle of (low-grade) vodka and leave for 10 days. Then run the contents of each bottle through a sieve lined with kitchen roll to remove the vegetable fat, capturing the infused vodka in a measuring jug. Voila. Taste the shamebow\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Jamie Harper (and 1,056 other Skittles vodka pedants).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI liked the story about Gheorghe Hagi\xe2\x80\x99s protest by only watching Romania on TV (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Bits and Bobs). I must be protesting against England, along with all the others who only watch England on TV.
