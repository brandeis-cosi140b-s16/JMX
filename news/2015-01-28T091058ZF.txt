b'Football transfer rumours: Everton to bid for Alexandre Pato?'


b'<p>You must forgive The Mill this morning. Like a raised bit of road designed to cull speed in residential areas, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the hump. That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that it is a slow news day, or that The Mill is a canine frothing at the mouth for a scrap of gossip but \xe2\x80\xa6 oh you get the picture.</p> <p>This week is all turning into a bit of an anticlimax. Normally spirits are high as the transfer window nears its end \xe2\x80\x93 dry January is coming to a close, youngsters everywhere are gearing themselves up for the traditional English pastime of huddled \xe2\x80\x9cin and around\xe2\x80\x9d a Sky Sports News presenter in a car park somewhere, and The Mill is kept busy with Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to sign every half-decent wantaway in Europe. But with this month being considerably \xe2\x80\x9cwetter\xe2\x80\x9d than anticipated, Sky Sports ruining everybody\xe2\x80\x99s fun, and Arsenal taking an eternity to get one miserly deal over the line, it\xe2\x80\x99s all gone to pot.</p> <p>Combine that with the fact that the biggest story of the day involves a Brazilian \xe2\x80\x93 urgh! \xe2\x80\x93 and it\xe2\x80\x99s all left The Mill feeling a bit underwhelmed. Alexandre Pato, you see, has been offered to just about every Premier League club and while Hull City and Queens Park Rangers (!) have decided that the 25-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s reported \xc2\xa360,000-a-week wages are too hefty, Everton\xe2\x80\x99s need to arrest their terrible run of form, and fill a Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o-shaped hole, has led to interest in the forward. The 25-year-old, who is currently on loan at S\xc3\xa3o Paulo from Corinthians, has largely struggled in his homeland since his \xe2\x80\x9cwonderkid\xe2\x80\x9d years in Italy and is thought to favour a move back to Europe.</p> <p>Manchester United seem intent on blowing far too much money on a La Liga defender with Athletic Bilbao\xe2\x80\x99s Aymeric Laporte the latest to be linked to the Premier League bigwigs. The Frenchman may have yet to earn an international cap \xe2\x80\x93 apparently finding Eliaquim Mangala and Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa (who has signed for Roma on a permanent deal for \xc2\xa35.5m) too difficult to usurp \xe2\x80\x93 but that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped Bilbao slapping a hefty \xc2\xa331.5m buyout clause on Laporte\xe2\x80\x99s contract as they attempt to pull a very expensive woolly jumper over Ed Woodward\xe2\x80\x99s head.</p> <p>Another Frenchman doing the rounds is Mill-favourite Morgan Schneiderlin, who has again been linked to a summer exit at Southampton. To replace him, manager Ronald Koeman has scoured the globe, searching for the next hidden gem, and decided that simply returning to the club he managed last year, Feyenoord, and plucking their diamond captain Jordy Clasie, is the best option.</p> <p>With a deal for Crystal Palace-bound Shola Ameobi apparently falling flat, West Bromwich Albion have opted for Besiktas\xe2\x80\x99s Demba Ba instead. The Senegalese, who was not included in his country\xe2\x80\x99s squad for the Africa Cup of Nations, has previously scored 43 times in 99 Premier League appearances for West Ham, Newcastle and Chelsea, with the Bimingham Mail linking the striker with a move to the Midlands.</p> <p>Finally, another Turkey-based player angling for a move back to Blighty is Galatasaray\xe2\x80\x99s Emmanuel Ebou\xc3\xa9, with Sunderland leading the chase, while Derby are chasing the QPR duo Junior Hoilett and Matty Phillips. What a way to end.</p>'
