b'Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez shrugs off pressure and hopes FA Cup can provide relief | Andy Hunter'


b'<p>The first press conference of 2015 at Everton\xe2\x80\x99s Finch Farm training ground and questions to Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez range from whether he feels increased pressure (answer: no) to does he retain the support of the chairman, Bill Kenwright (answer: yes). This was no media hysteria; it really has reached this point for the man lauded for removing the glass ceiling from Everton\xe2\x80\x99s ambitions merely seven months ago.</p> <p>In June Mart\xc3\xadnez was rewarded with a new five-year contract for an outstanding debut season as Everton manager, one that yielded the club\xe2\x80\x99s record points total in the Premier League era and had supporters singing about the reopening of the \xe2\x80\x98School of Science\xe2\x80\x99 given the polished performances on display. The contract was one example of Everton\xe2\x80\x99s trust in their intelligent, driven young manager. Backing his plans to spend a club-record \xc2\xa328m on Romelu Lukaku and to construct overnight accommodation at Finch Farm were others.</p> <p>On Tuesday he faces a delicate, daunting FA Cup third-round tie against West Ham United in charge of a team who have rapidly lost their way and stand four points above the relegation zone after four successive defeats over the festive period. Mart\xc3\xadnez had described the new year\xe2\x80\x99s day trip to Hull City as vital. A 2-0 defeat produced more abject defending, further evidence of senior players abdicating responsibility and more supporters questioning Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s methods and decision-making. A win over West Ham \xe2\x80\x9ccould be a pivotal moment in our season\xe2\x80\x9d, said the Everton manager on Monday. It would also register as a shock on current form.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is I feel under the same pressure when we win and when we lose because I always look forward,\xe2\x80\x9d Mart\xc3\xadnez said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy vision is to create a team that can become a winning team. Losing games forces you to try and find solutions and to look inside in a different way than when you win.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe chairman here is a proper, proper Evertonian and he is an incredible support. He never stops wanting to help and trying to be supportive and he is the perfect chairman in that respect. In the same way, he is hurting like we all are because he is not a businessman or someone who is there just for the financial aspect. It is the complete opposite, he is an Evertonian that really cares about the football club and the results are paramount. But the support I have got from day one has been incredible and that really helps in moments like the one we are experiencing now. I know I\xe2\x80\x99ve got his support if anything needs to be done to help the squad. I\xe2\x80\x99ve said many times to our fans that we are in fantastic hands and we should never lose that, ever.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Evertonians, Kenwright included, must be wondering where the next win is coming from and how the exuberance of last season has turned to exasperation so rapidly. Lamentable defending littered with individual errors has plagued Everton all season, only Queens Park Rangers have conceded more goals in the Premier League. Injuries have been a constant disruption, especially in terms of having a settled defence, and Mart\xc3\xadnez wants a new, long-term goalkeeper from the January window after Tim Howard was ruled out until mid-February with a calf problem. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are certain positions where you need continuity and consistency because of the players\xe2\x80\x99 understanding,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mart\xc3\xadnez, who may consider a move for Ali al-Habsi at Wigan Athletic. \xe2\x80\x9cThe centre-halves and goalkeeper is one such unit and we have had too many changes in there.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>All true, but that does not explain his faith in his former Wigan charges Joel Robles and Antol\xc3\xadn Alcaraz, whose suspension against West Ham will not be a cause of despair on the Gwladys Street. Other charges levelled against Everton should be more concerning for Mart\xc3\xadnez, however.</p> <p>One is that opponents have easily nullified his team\xe2\x80\x99s attacking threat by denying space to Leighton Baines and S\xc3\xa9amus Coleman, arguably the most effective full-back pairing in the Premier League last season but struggling now. His frequent deployment of Ross Barkley out wide has bemused for the simple reason that it has rarely worked. So too his reliance on Gareth Barry when James McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s on-going hamstring injury has removed energy and insurance from central midfield. The most serious accusation, one recent performances have done little to dispel, is that Everton players are not comfortable with their manager\xe2\x80\x99s instructions and have gone into hiding.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say hiding, no,\xe2\x80\x9d Mart\xc3\xadnez countered. \xe2\x80\x9cI do think during a period when we have had four defeats in the league, we all need to do more.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the manager, the staff and the players. We all need to do more. And if it\xe2\x80\x99s 5%, it\xe2\x80\x99s 5%. We all need to do more. The way I see it is that I have seen a lot of character, a lot of responsibility and I think some of the players have been too affected by the bad results and the confidence has gone low for the right reasons.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s something we need to get rid of and start enjoying our football again. The FA Cup could give us that; it\xe2\x80\x99s a completely different game, a different situation where you don\xe2\x80\x99t carry any luggage from what happened in the past. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fresh competition that we need to enjoy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The situation could get worse for Mart\xc3\xadnez with Manchester City due at Goodison Park on Saturday but, intriguingly, he insists the long-term repercussions could be widespread.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI trust the chairman, I trust the board and everyone at the football club to make sure we get through this period together,\xe2\x80\x9d Mart\xc3\xadnez said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a real challenge, a real test, but sometimes you need those sort of tests to find who is ready to take the football club forward and that\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
