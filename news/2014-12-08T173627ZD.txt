b'Diego Costa could start for Chelsea against Sporting Lisbon'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho is considering starting Diego Costa in Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s final Champions League group game against Sporting Lisbon as he seeks to improve the Spain forward\xe2\x80\x99s match fitness after his progress was interrupted by injury.</p> <p>Chelsea have already qualified for the knockout phase of the competition as group winners and are expected to rest key players in the game against the Portuguese \xe2\x80\x93 who still aspire to finish second \xe2\x80\x93 at Stamford Bridge ahead of the cluttered festive schedule. Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas, Thibaut Courtois and Eden Hazard are likely to sit out the fixture, though Costa may now gain some game-time with Mourinho having suggested the forward needs \xe2\x80\x9cto improve his condition\xe2\x80\x9d in the aftermath of Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s first defeat of the season, at Newcastle.</p> <p>Costa, who began life at Chelsea with an eye-catching seven goals in four league games, was omitted from the Spain squad in last month\xe2\x80\x99s international window to rest after a series of persistent hamstring and groin complaints. He was suspended for the midweek victory over Tottenham Hotspur having picked up a fifth booking of the campaign at Sunderland and, while his threat and work-rate have remained a constant, the striker has only scored twice in his last seven outings stretching back to mid-October.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFor me, the problem is not the goals \xe2\x80\x93 they will come as a consequence of his condition,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has to improve his condition. He was injured and had many doubts because he went a long time without training. Obviously that must have an effect on a player in the way he runs, the way he moves and in his co-ordination. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is any problem but he has to recover.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>An outing against Sporting, who are competing with Schalke for the runners-up place behind Chelsea, might offer an opportunity to sharpen his fitness with Mourinho expected to offer game-time to other fringe players such as Ramires, Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my, Kurt Zouma and Filipe Lu\xc3\xads. The Brazil left-back is the only player in the squad who is one booking away from a European suspension, though the club boast adequate cover at full-back. Nemanja Matic, who was suspended at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park, may also sit out the game offering another opportunity to John Mikel Obi, while Petr Cech will return in goal for Courtois.</p>'
