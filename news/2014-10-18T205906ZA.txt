b'Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger needs pizza back on the menu at Arsenal | Daniel Taylor'


b'<p>Perhaps the strangest part of what happened the day Arsenal lost their Invincibles status against Manchester United is that, however much the evidence pointed to Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas, we are still waiting for the formal identification of whoever reached for that slice of pizza and, to quote Ashley Cole, hit Sir Alex Ferguson \xe2\x80\x9cstraight in the mush\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>The common suspicion that it was F\xc3\xa0bregas, an unused 17-year-old substitute, was strengthened by that passage in Cole\xe2\x80\x99s book reminiscing unsympathetically about watching the pepperoni flying over his head towards Ferguson and \xe2\x80\x9cslip off that famous puce face and roll down his nice black suit\xe2\x80\x9d, before offering a clue that the culprit was neither English nor French.</p> <p>United\xe2\x80\x99s players have always been convinced it was the youngest member of Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s squad and Gary Neville will tell you that when he and his team-mates got wind of it they retreated to their own food table for retaliatory ammunition. It had needed Ferguson to put a stop to it otherwise the back corridors of Old Trafford might have resembled the final scene from Bugsy Malone.</p> <p>F\xc3\xa0bregas, however, has always denied it. Arsenal have operated a policy of dressing-room omerta apart from one occasion a few years later when Martin Keown corroborated the F\xc3\xa0bregas link on a radio interview. Yet Keown had left Arsenal the previous summer and, in the absence of strapping a polygraph to the alleged perpetrator, Ferguson puts out his updated autobiography next week admitting he is still none the wiser. \xe2\x80\x9cThey say it was Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas who threw the pizza at me but, to this day, I have no idea who the culprit was,\xe2\x80\x9d it reads.</p> <p>The 10th anniversary is on Friday and, plainly, Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s men would rather airbrush it from their memories judging by the little scene that unfolded when my colleague Amy Lawrence interviewed Kolo Tour\xc3\xa9 for her new book about Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s unbeaten 2003\xe2\x80\x9104 league season, Invincible, and the conversation turned to how their 49-match unbeaten sequence was sabotaged in Manchester the following October. Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s first reaction was to close his eyes and grimace. The disappointment had never left him, he said, and it was unmistakable sadness on his face. He had his fist clenched, and he was banging it against his heart. \xe2\x80\x9cI still have that here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>At Arsenal, they would rather remember the unity and brilliance that went into establishing a top\xe2\x80\x91division record and rightly so given that it was the stuff of football dreams. Patrick Vieira, the embodiment of that team, was inducted into the National Football Museum\xe2\x80\x99s Hall of Fame on Thursday, exactly a decade after the 49th game of that run had resulted in a 3-1 defeat of Aston Villa at Highbury.</p> <p>Keown was at the ceremony and listening to their stories, looking at these men in their crisp black suits and thinking they would not look out of place on the door of a high-street nightclub, it was a reminder not just that Wenger once assembled the most formidable and physically imposing team of their era but also, perhaps, what the current side sorely lacks.</p> <p>Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s greatest teams were not just capable of brilliantly joined-up football and making opponents feel, as Neville once said, like they were \xe2\x80\x9cmarking the Red Arrows.\xe2\x80\x9d They were, for the most part, wholly formed men of the world and even if they did sometimes blur the lines between what was right and what was wrong that always tends to be the way for the teams with the greatest competitive courage and, ultimately, the more cluttered trophy cabinets.</p> <p>Rio Ferdinand makes that point in his latest autobiography, explaining how unnerving it could be to play against Dennis Bergkamp when the great Dutchman never looked him in eye and generally gave the impression his veins contained ice. Ferdinand says there have been only a handful of other opponents who have made him feel that way and names Lionel Messi and Zinedine Zidane among them. You could stare at them, nudge them, shout at them; they would just blank you. \xe2\x80\x9cOne time when I was quite young, at Leeds, I asked Dennis Bergkamp: \xe2\x80\x98Do you want to swap shirts after the game?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t swap shirts,\xe2\x80\x99 he said, just completely cold. It made me feel even more inferior to him. He stomped me out like a cigarette. I hated him when I played against him after that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Arsenal still have their days, but at some point they have lost that streetwise edge. Sam Allardyce once told me that one of the reasons why he packed his Bolton Wanderers side with so many six-footers was because his team had stood next to Arsenal in the tunnel at Highbury and felt physically inferior. Roy Keane went to war with Vieira but now says if it had ever become physical the odds would have been heavily stacked in favour of the Arsenal man.</p> <p>A team\xe2\x80\x99s personality can always be gauged by away results and, aside from all the acclaim for the subject of Lawrence\xe2\x80\x99s book, people tend to forget that Arsenal did not lose on the road when they won the Double in 2001-02 (the current team have gone four years since they won away against a side that finished in the top four).</p> <p>The previous record had been set 26 years earlier by a Nottingham Forest side that went 42 successive matches unbeaten and, like Arsenal, attracted great acclaim for their style of football. Yet Brian Clough\xe2\x80\x99s great team did feature two players, Larry Lloyd and Kenny Burns, who formed the ugliest, meanest central defensive partnership of their time and, in the days of disciplinary points, strategically used to plan their assaults on rival centre-forwards depending on who was closest to a suspension.</p> <p>Lloyd broke his foot in the middle of the 1977-78 season and Clough immediately signed David Needham from QPR to replace him. Needham played impeccably for six weeks until Lloyd was fit again. Clough put him straight back in and Lloyd remembers it as one of the great compliments of his career. \xe2\x80\x9cHe turned to Needham first: \xe2\x80\x98David, you\xe2\x80\x99re probably wondering why I\xe2\x80\x99ve left you out. You\xe2\x80\x99ve done ever so well since I bought you. David, I really can\xe2\x80\x99t fault you. You\xe2\x80\x99re a lovely boy. If my daughter were looking to bring a man home to marry, you\xe2\x80\x99d be that man. You\xe2\x80\x99re that nice, David, I\xe2\x80\x99d have you as my son-in-law\xe2\x80\x99. Then he pointed at me. \xe2\x80\x98I hate that fucking bastard over there. And that\xe2\x80\x99s why you\xe2\x80\x99re not in the team. You\xe2\x80\x99re not a bastard like Larry Lloyd. And, son, I want a bastard in my defence.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>At Chelsea, the leadership qualities start with John Terry and run right through the team, incorporating Branislav Ivanovic, Nemanja Matic, Diego Costa and many others. Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s championships have been won through sturdy men such as Vincent Kompany, Pablo Zabaleta, Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 and Gareth Barry. Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s successful teams always had immense courage and, if necessary, a bit of brute force.</p> <p>The same applied to Arsenal back in the day, with a dressing room comprising some of the sport\xe2\x80\x99s strongest and most demanding characters. It is just not so easy to see their physical and mental toughness these days, and perhaps that game at Old Trafford was the first clear sign of what was to come remembering the way Neville and his brother, Phil, ganged up and eventually broke Jos\xc3\xa9 Antonio Reyes. Neville devotes a full chapter to it in his autobiography. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s a football match,\xe2\x80\x99 Ferguson had said in his team-talk. \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to tackle. And no other team tackles them so let\xe2\x80\x99s make sure Mister Pires and Mister Henry know today is going to be hard. Today is going to be different.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Arsenal have lost 75 league games since the Invincibles era and almost a third of them, 22, have been to United or Chelsea. They particularly tend to crumple when the opposition is from Stamford Bridge and that was an intriguing line from Keane the other day about the modern dressing-room culture of teams posting celebratory selfies on Twitter, sometimes from fairly routine wins, and what it said to him about a \xe2\x80\x9clack of characters and good lads\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Did he mean Arsenal? He did not mention them by name but the odds, I would say, are roughly the same as F\xc3\xa0bregas\xe2\x80\x99s fingerprints being found all over that pizza.</p> Wily Redknapp knows time is running out <p>It can be difficult sometimes with Harry Redknapp. Anything positive \xe2\x80\x93 and, heck, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a great deal of that right now \xe2\x80\x93 gets a football writer immediately lumped into the \xe2\x80\x9cFriends of Harry\xe2\x80\x9d camp, as if there is a secret group of us who break bread and clink wine glasses with him every Friday night. He divides opinion like few others and is the teller of enough white lies that it\xe2\x80\x99s not difficult to understand sometimes if people think he is as slippery as a mackerel.</p> <p>Equally, his achievements are more pronounced than many are willing to admit and it always seems slightly unfair to me that someone with a promoted team can face the sack seven games into the new season because his team have found it difficult to adjust.</p> <p>That, however, is the nature of the business and Redknapp is streetwise enough to recognise the signs. Increasingly, it looks like he might not make it to a second anniversary at QPR and, after that, who can really say whether he will have the stomach to start again somewhere else \xe2\x80\x93 if, that is, there would there be another Premier League job for him.</p> <p>He is 68 on his next birthday and when Tottenham sacked him in June 2012 he was on record as saying he was surprised how little he missed the sport and having a better idea why Joe Royle and various other managers in the same age bracket were telling him he would be better off cashing the cheque and staying away for good.</p> <p>Redknapp was tempted back by the old urges but the impression here is of someone who has not fully connected with QPR during his 23 months in the job. If the guillotine does come down there are no guarantees when, or even if, he will be back.</p> Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s humility needs a shake-up <p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho, once again, was indulging us with multiple sarcasms. \xe2\x80\x9cI appreciate the comments,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, for the benefit of Aston Villa\xe2\x80\x99s manager, Paul Lambert, and his assistant, Roy Keane. \xe2\x80\x9cI think they are both great examples of polite and very well educated people, and because I\xe2\x80\x99m a humble guy who tries to learn every day and with every experience, I appreciate the comments.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s put this in perspective: offering an early handshake is not the greatest crime in the sport and maybe it is a bit rich to get a lecture in sporting etiquette from Keane when he is promoting a book that also tells the story of going into the opposition manager\xe2\x80\x99s office for the customary post-match drink and ending up throttling one of the coaches with his tie.</p> <p>All the same, it should hardly be a surprise to Mourinho that it might provoke a response from Keane, Lambert and others if he sticks to what he says and continues with that strange routine of going over to the opposition dugout when the match is still actually being played. It is a public form of belittling, intentional or not, and someone as humble as Jos\xc3\xa9 should surely realise that.</p>'
