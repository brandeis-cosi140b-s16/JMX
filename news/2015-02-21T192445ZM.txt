b'<p>Was that fun? I don\xe2\x80\x99t really know. A penalty for City after 26 seconds was the last thing this game needed really; they quickly built on Aguero\xe2\x80\x99s conversion with two more goals and that was that. Silva, who had a delightful game and set up Dzeko\xe2\x80\x99s goal beautifully, added two very nice second-half goals but the pace was friendly-like for two-thirds of this one.</p> <p>So City move to within five points of Chelsea, which keeps the title race interesting. Newcastle kept trying but the feeling persists that, if you could really do with three points, they are the side in the league you\xe2\x80\x99d probably most like to face \xe2\x80\x93 even though they sit in an innocuous enough 11th. It was calamity after calamity from them today, and John Carver\xe2\x80\x99s hopes of a long-term gig can\xe2\x80\x99t have been helped by this.</p> <p>So, think on all that and I\xe2\x80\x99ll bid you goodnight. Back tomorrow for a couple more of these, so maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll interact then. Thanks for reading/corresponding, and have a great evening.</p>'
