b"Who is football's oldest-ever goalscorer?"


b'<p>\xe2\x80\x9cWatching Nick Easter become England\xe2\x80\x99s Oldest Ever Try Scorer made me ask my dog \xe2\x80\x98Who is professional football\xe2\x80\x99s oldest ever goalscorer?\xe2\x80\x99 She didn\xe2\x80\x99t know or isn\xe2\x80\x99t telling, but do you?\xe2\x80\x9d asks David Templeman.</p> <p>Football, of course, was invented in 1992 and the oldest scorer in Premier League history is Teddy Sheringham, who was 40 years and 268 days old when he scored for West Ham in their 2-1 defeat to Portsmouth at Upton Park on 26 December 2006. It was Sheringham\xe2\x80\x99s last goal in the top flight and that particular record is yet to be beaten.</p> <p>But that\xe2\x80\x99s not the answer you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for, is it. So how about the oldest goalscorer in World Cup history? Well, that would be Roger Milla, who was 42 years and 39 days old when he grabbed Cameroon\xe2\x80\x99s consolation in their 6-1 defeat to Russia at USA 94.</p> <p>Even then, however, we can go further. Here is a list of the 10 oldest goalscorers in international football.</p> <ol> <li>Billy Meredith Wales (45 years and 73 days old, Wales 2-1 England on 11 October 1919) </li> <li>Keithroy Cornelius US Virgin Islands (43 years and 196 days old, US Virgin Islands 1-6 Curacao, 15 November 2011)</li> <li>Aleksandar \xc4\x90uri\xc4\x87 Singapore (42 years and 105 days old, Singapore 3-0 Malaysia, 25 November 2012)</li> <li>Roger Milla Cameroon (42 years and 39 days old, Cameroon 1-6 Russia, 28 June 1994) </li> <li>Jocelyn Angloma Guadeloupe (41years and 314 days old, Guadeloupe 2-1 Honduras, 17 June 2007) </li> <li>Stanley Matthews England (41 years and 248 days old, England 1-1 Northern Ireland, 6 October 1956) </li> <li>Kalusha Bwalya Zambia (41 years and 19 days old, Zambia 1-0 Liberia, 4 September 2004) </li> <li>Fung King-Cheung Hong Kong (40 years and 100 days old, Hong Kong 2-1 South Vietnam, 28 March 1948) </li> <li>Russell Latapy Trinidad &amp; Tobago (40 years and 74 days old, Trinidad &amp; Tobago 2-1 USA, 15 October 2008) </li> <li>Baqt\xc3\xafyar Bayseyitov Kazakhstan (39 years and 311 days old, Kazakhstan 1-0 Libya, 3 July 1992)</li> </ol> <p>Meanwhile the oldest scorer of an own goal in international football is none other than Dwight Ferguson of the US Virgin Islands. He was 41 years and 167 days old when he put the ball past his own goalkeeper in a 10-0 defeat to Grenada on 26 March 2008. </p> <p>But club football offers even more ancient scorers. \xe2\x80\x9cBilly Meredith scored his last goal at the age of 49 years 208 days for Manchester City against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion at the Goldstone Ground on 23 February 1924 in the third round of the FA Cup,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Malcolm Warburton. \xe2\x80\x9cStanley Matthews scored his last goal at the age of 49 years 14 days for Stoke City against Swansea Town (as they then were) at the Victoria Ground on 15 February 1964 in the fifth round of the FA Cup. In each case this was the \xe2\x80\x98last 16\xe2\x80\x99 round.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Can anyone do better than Billy Meredith?</p> DUGOUT PUNCH-UPS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cArguments during games between opposing dug-outs are ten a penny,\xe2\x80\x9d begins Malcolm McFeat. \xe2\x80\x9cBut are there any memorable examples where it\xe2\x80\x99s all kicked off within the one technical area? For example a manager and his assistant coming to blows.\xe2\x80\x9d </p> <p>Well, who can forget that exchange between Paolo Di Canio and Wes Foderingham in 2012? Foderingham, Swindon\xe2\x80\x99s goalkeeper, had made a mistake that led to a Preston North End goal and Di Canio, his manager, decided to take him off after 21 minutes. Views were exchanged. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the worst professional I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen,\xe2\x80\x9d Di Canio said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t only the mistake, which can happen to everyone. It was the arrogance later on when he started moaning to the others. That was the worst thing for me. If he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come out and say sorry to the fans for his professionalism, then he is out of my team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>And how about the time ... oh God, it\xe2\x80\x99s Di Canio again, this time involved in a bust-up with Leon Clarke after a defeat to Southampton in 2011. Clarke had a disagreement with Swindon\xe2\x80\x99s fitness coach, Claudio Donatelli, and Di Canio\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to diffuse the situation backfired.</p> <p>Jorg Michner remembers that infamous row in the Fiorentina camp in May 2012: \xe2\x80\x9cA quite bizarre moment took place in May 2012 in Italy, when Fiorentina manager Delio Rossi took off Adem Ljajic after only 32 minutes with his team trailing 2-0 against minnows Novara. Ljajic insulted Rossi as he took his seat in the dugout, and Rossi decided to explain the substitution with his best Mike Tyson impression. He was sacked the same day.\xe2\x80\x9d </p> <p>Bobby Dunnett\xe2\x80\x99s memory is also whirring. \xe2\x80\x9cNear the start of the 2002 season, in the dour Trevor Francis era at Palace, we went a goal down at home to Bradford,\xe2\x80\x9d says Bobby says. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen our \xe2\x80\x9ceccentric\xe2\x80\x9d substitute goalkeeper, Alex Kolinko, apparently laughed, Francis responded by punching him in the face. A 5-0 win over Brighton and an FA Cup win at Anfield aside, this was probably the highlight of that forgettable period.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> NO REPLAYS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe FA Cup fifth round proper featured no draws, thus no replays. When was the last time a round that big (fifth round proper or earlier) featured no replays?\xe2\x80\x9d asks Patrick Tarbox.</p> <p>Well spotted, Patrick. That is unusual and it has not happened in a round that big for a while. In fact, you have to go back to the fourth round in the 2007-08 season, when all 16 ties were settled at the first time of asking. Portsmouth won it that year and everyone at Fratton Park lived happily ever after. Anyway, here are those fourth-round results.</p>  <p>Arsenal 3-0 Newcastle United</p> <p>Coventry 2-1 Millwall</p> <p>Oldham Athletic 0-1 Huddersfield</p> <p>Barnet 0-1 Bristol Rovers</p> <p>Liverpool 5-2 Havant &amp; Waterlooville</p> <p>Southend United 0-1 Barnsley</p> <p>Wigan Athletic 1-2 Chelsea</p> <p>Derby County 1-4 Preston North End</p> <p>Manchester United 3-1 Tottenham Hotspur</p> <p>Portsmouth 2-1 Plymouth Argyle</p> <p>Southampton 2-0 Bury</p> <p>Hereford United 1-2 Cardiff City</p> <p>Peterborough United 0-3 West Bromwich Albion</p> <p>Mansfield Town 0-2 Middlesbrough </p> <p>Sheffield United 2-1 Manchester City</p> <p>Watford 1-4 Wolverhampton Wanderers</p>  KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn view of the shenanigans at Old Trafford last week,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Hugh Chambers in 2005,\xe2\x80\x9dhas the FA ever changed a result after a game had finished?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find a situation where the result of a game had been directly altered after a match has finished. However, with a little help from the FA, we did discover some games that were replayed in unorthodox circumstances.</p> <p>The most obvious, of course, was the 1999 FA Cup fifth-round tie between Arsenal and Sheffield United, in which Kanu played the role of pantomime villain. New to English football, and oblivious to the tradition of returning the ball to the opposition when it has been kicked out of play to allow treatment for injury, Kanu collected the resulting throw-in and crossed for Marc Overmars to score the winner. Or so it seemed.</p> <p>But after an almighty hullabaloo from an aggrieved United side, Arsene Wenger suggested that the match should be replayed. The FA agreed, and Arsenal won 2-1. The Knowledge applauds this example of fair play, and is absolutely sure Mr Wenger will be just as magnanimous should something similar happen in a Premiership title decider.</p> <p>More obscurely, two other FA Cup ties were replayed. In 1985, Leicester City trounced Burton Albion 6-1 but the FA ordered the match to be replayed behind closed doors due to a bout of coin-throwing from the terraces. Leicester won the replay, which was played at Coventry\xe2\x80\x99s Highfield Road, 1-0.</p> <p>And Peterborough United hammered Kingstonian 9-1 in a first-round replay in 1992, but missile throwing again led to a replay, which Peterborough won 1-0.</p> CAN YOU HELP? <p>\xe2\x80\x9cReading about Parma\xe2\x80\x99s financial woes in Paolo Bandini\xe2\x80\x99s piece this week, I was interested to hear that if the stricken Italian club goes bust after the halfway point in the season, Italian rules are that the results of games played will stand but all their remaining fixtures will go down as 3-0 defeats regardless. This got me to wondering, has a team ever gone bust during a season and still won their division? And have these kinds of consequences of a team going bust ever changed the result of a competition for other teams?,\xe2\x80\x9d ponders Jack Carradine.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe 21 February saw the first league game of 2015 in the Hungarian top flight \xe2\x80\x93 the Paks\xe2\x80\x93Nyiregyhaza match was postponed from December. Due to the registration rules none of Ny\xc3\xadregyh\xc3\xa1za\xe2\x80\x99s winter signings could be registered for the match (only players registered for the teams back in December were available for selection). That \xe2\x80\x93 coupled with injuries and a suspension \xe2\x80\x93 left Nyiregyhaza with only 14 players, three of whom were goalkeepers. Goalie Volodymyr Ovsienko started up front as a target man on his top flight debut at the age of 36 and played 81 minutes (he even had a chance from a header!). In the 90th minute the backup goalie Alex Hrabina was subbed in as an outfield player, too. Do you know of any other instances that two goalkeepers played for the same team as outfield players in a top flight match?\xe2\x80\x9d asks Marosi Gergely.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI recall a few seasons ago my club, Wolves, earning a shock win against a then-unbeaten Manchester United in early February. This got me thinking, what\xe2\x80\x99s the latest in the season that a club\xe2\x80\x99s unbeaten run has come to an end? Obviously, Invincible seasons don\xe2\x80\x99t count. How about the latest a 100% winning run coming to an end?\xe2\x80\x9d offers Daniel Yambao. </p> <p>Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com</p>'
