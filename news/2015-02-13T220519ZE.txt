b'England 0-1 USA | Women\xe2\x80\x99s friendly international match report'


b'<p>England deserved at least a draw, insisted their head coach Mark Sampson after a game in which his team had an equalising goal incorrectly ruled out for offside after the striker Alex Morgan\xe2\x80\x99s 25th-minute opener for the USA. But after another defeat to one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s top nations, and with the World Cup finals in Canada only four months away, Sampson concluded ruefully that, \xe2\x80\x9ceventually, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to find away to win.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Finding a way to win against the best will be vital if England are to be successful in the summer, but despite a defeat against the world\xe2\x80\x99s second best side coming in the wake of November\xe2\x80\x99s 3-0 trouncing by Germany, the top team, at Wembley, Sampson feels his side are on track.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very pleased with the progress the team have made,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand we\xe2\x80\x99re keen to take on more of these challenges. The work ethic of the players tonight was outstanding, and we deserved at least a draw \xe2\x80\x93 especially bearing in mind we scored a perfectly good goal.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe weren\xe2\x80\x99t cut open at all and although the Americans got too many balls into the box for our liking, we defended those crosses admirably in the main.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Sampson had made five changes from the team that lost to Germany, dropping his midfield diamond formation for a more solid 4-4-2. \xe2\x80\x9cIt worked well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe two centre backs and two central midfielders stepped up to the plate and we stood up well to America\xe2\x80\x99s physicality.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about learning and the team getting better. The players had dusted themselves down after the Germany game and they were much better tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>One player unable to \xe2\x80\x9cstep up to the plate\xe2\x80\x9d was the Chelsea captain Katie Chapman, recalled to the squad after four years in the international wilderness but an unused substitute. Chapman had been in an unwanted \xe2\x80\x9cretirement\xe2\x80\x9d after childcare issues, leading to an impasse with the former coach Hope Powell that had resulted in her departure.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been great to get Katie some minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sampson. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure she would have loved that opportunity. It was a real special moment in the team room earlier today when Katie got handed her jersey, I think she certainly shed a few tears, it was an important moment for her but the most important thing for Katie was to get her back in the group and see how she fitted in \xe2\x80\x93 and she fitted in fantastically well.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been nice to get her on if the circumstances had been different, but unfortunately they weren\xe2\x80\x99t. We would have liked to be ahead and get Katie on to see it out, but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure she\xe2\x80\x99ll play a big part for us in the future.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>After a tentative opening, the decisive goal came when the USA midfielder Lauren Holiday crossed for Morgan to head home all too easily after 25 minutes. It was the 50th goal of her career in 79 appearances.</p> <p>England struggled to create too many clear-cut chances but their best came when the Reading striker Fran Kirby lofted in a 20-yard shot that was turned on to the crossbar by the keeper Ashlyn Harris, and though Kirby\xe2\x80\x99s strike partner Jodie Taylor tucked in the rebound the flag was up for offside \xe2\x80\x93 though replays showed that she had been well onside.</p>'
