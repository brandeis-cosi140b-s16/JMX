b'<p>Mesut \xc3\x96zil has been ruled out for between 10 and 12 weeks with a partial knee ligament tear that he suffered during Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s 2-0 loss to Chelsea on Sunday. The Germany midfielder played on through the pain to complete the 90 minutes and he reported the problem to Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s medical staff after the game. It did not seem overly serious at the time.</p> <p>However, the full extent of the injury became clear on Wednesday after \xc3\x96zil underwent an MRI scan in Germany, where he was on international duty. The German Football Federation [DFB] tweeted the update that \xc3\x96zil would be out for \xe2\x80\x9c10-12 weeks with a partial lateral ligament tear in the left knee\xe2\x80\x9d. The tweet finished by saying \xe2\x80\x9cGet well soon!\xe2\x80\x9d and the manner in which the DFB broke the news has gone down badly at Arsenal.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is too early to say how long \xc3\x96zil may be out of action,\xe2\x80\x9d Arsenal said, in a statement. They added that the 25-year-old was returning to London, so that the club could make their own checks and determine the best course of action in terms of his rehabilitation. \xc3\x96zil has a close relationship with Dr Hans-Wilhelm M\xc3\xbcller-Wohlfahrt, the Germany doctor, and, in the past, he has preferred to be treated by him.</p> <p>\xc3\x96zil had travelled to Frankfurt on Tuesday to link up with the Germany squad before their Euro 2016 qualifiers against Poland and the Republic of Ireland, with Arsenal having informed the DFB about the injury. The club told the Germans to exercise caution and check on the problem. Accordingly, \xc3\x96zil was sent for a scan with M\xc3\xbcller-Wohlfahrt in Munich, which revealed the damage.</p> <p>The DFB\xe2\x80\x99s head of communications, Jens Grittner, had made it clear that \xc3\x96zil had travelled with the problem and the organisation reinforced the point in their statement. \xe2\x80\x9c\xc3\x96zil complained about pain in his left knee when he arrived in Frankfurt on Tuesday,\xe2\x80\x9d they said.</p> <p>\xc3\x96zil has played through the pain for Arsenal before \xe2\x80\x93 and suffered for it. He hurt his hamstring early on in the Champions League last 16, second-leg tie at Bayern Munich last March but he continued until half-time. He was out for six weeks on that occasion.</p> <p>\xc3\x96zil joins has joined a lengthy injury list at Arsenal, with Olivier Giroud and Mathieu Debuchy long-term casualties because of fibula and ankle problems respectively, and Aaron Ramsey not expected to play before the start of November because of a hamstring strain. Theo Walcott, Serge Gnabry, Yaya Sanogo, Mikel Arteta and Abou Diaby are also out.</p>    <p>BREAKING: @MesutOzil1088 out for 10-12 weeks with partial lateral collateral ligament tear in left knee.
