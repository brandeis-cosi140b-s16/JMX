b'Mauricio Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s Southampton return will bring warmth from staff but bile from fans'


b'<p>The expressions on the faces of the dozen or so diners betrayed surprise and delight. It was an end-of-season meal last May, in honour of a couple of junior members of the Southampton recruitment department who were leaving the club, and nobody expected Mauricio Pochettino to turn up. But there he was. And, at the end of the bash, the manager picked up the bill. Nobody thought he was anything other than a guy with class.</p> <p>The episode is one of many over the course of Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s 18-month tenure at Southampton that illustrated the bond he enjoyed with his colleagues, and how he finessed it. Every day, he would pop his head around doors to say hello. His regular attendance at under-13 matches, for example, and the way he would chat to the boys\xe2\x80\x99 parents in that courteous manner of his, is fondly remembered.</p> <p>When he showed up unannounced at the restaurant that night, he was still in charge at Southampton \xe2\x80\x93 just about. The stories linking him with a move to Tottenham Hotspur were growing in intensity and, on 27 May, it was confirmed he would be succeeding the sacked Tim Sherwood at White Hart Lane.</p> <p>Inside the club at Southampton, there was disappointment but realism. They know that managers no longer stick around like Ted Bates or Lawrie McMenemy. To borrow a phrase from Pochettino: this is football. The friendships that were formed with the Argentinian were not going to fall apart over a career move and, when he returns to St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s for the first time with Tottenham on Saturday, the welcome behind the scenes will be warm.</p> <p>Up in the stands, it will be markedly different. Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s defection was not in the same league as that of Harry Redknapp, who took Southampton down from the Premier League in 2005 and then returned to the club\xe2\x80\x99s hated rivals, Portsmouth. But it is interesting to hear the view of Steve Grant, who runs the fans\xe2\x80\x99 forum SaintsWeb, on the reception Pochettino can expect.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt will not be Redknapp levels but it won\xe2\x80\x99t be far off,\xe2\x80\x9d Grant says. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of people felt very let down by Pochettino although, given the fact he arrived in an underhand manner, people should not be particularly surprised that he left in an underhand manner. The most recent event, though, takes precedent.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pochettino had been hired by the club\xe2\x80\x99s former chairman, Nicola Cortese, in January 2013 to replace Nigel Adkins. Southampton were 15th in the Premier League and only two teams had worse defensive records, but they had just come from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 at Chelsea and Adkins was very popular with the fans. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my fault,\xe2\x80\x9d Pochettino says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe president offered me the job. But it was a tough situation.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s reign was fired by the victories over Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea in his first nine games and his status was cemented by the eighth-placed finish last season. He appreciated the values of the club; he was not afraid to give young players their chance and he imbued the team with greater defensive stability and an attractive, high-pressing style, even if his tactics seemed to lack a Plan B.</p> <p>In short, Pochettino took Southampton to the next level and so when he left, it was harder to bear, particularly when he was followed by a clutch of important players. Many supporters suspected that when Pochettino knew he was going, he told Adam Lallana, Luke Shaw and Rickie Lambert that they might see it as a good time to move too, which they did. Once at Tottenham, Saints fans raged when Pochettino tried to sign Morgan Schneiderlin and Jay Rodriguez, although they would be kept at St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s.</p>     Mauricio Pochettino was popular at Southampton but the manner of his departure means he will receive a frosty reception from some fans. Photograph: Richard Sellers/Getty Images    <p>Southampton were supposed to be destined for a difficult season but it speaks volumes for the structures and methodologies they have in place that they have been able to restrengthen and look even better. In Ronald Koeman, they recruited a stellar managerial name, whose professionalism, tactical nous and personality have shone from the outset while their signings have been excellent.</p> <p>Pochettino makes the point that Koeman has been allowed to spend around \xc2\xa370m in fees on reshaping the squad \xe2\x80\x93 overlooking the fact that Southampton recouped \xc2\xa392.5 from sales last summer \xe2\x80\x93 while he has been permitted only \xc2\xa332m at Tottenham. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a massive difference with us this season,\xe2\x80\x9d Pochettino says.</p> <p>But Pochettino is a generous type, with barely a bad word for any rival and he is full of praise for Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s work. With Southampton sitting seventh, one point and one place behind Tottenham, he even says that Koeman should win the manager of the year award.</p> <p>One testament to how Southampton have come to function as an organisation is that Tottenham have seemingly tried to copy them. They took Paul Mitchell from Southampton last November to become their head of recruitment and he has restructured their academy and scouting system, attempting to make the processes more holistic, as they are at Southampton. For a long time, Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s scouting has been a mess.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe have created a strong structure in the club with [the sporting director] Franco Baldini, Paul Mitchell and a lot of people that have joined us in the department of scouting,\xe2\x80\x9d Pochettino says. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are ready to take decisions and try to improve our squad.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pochettino has done a good job so far in what he says must be considered a transitional season but Koeman and Southampton plan an uncomfortable afternoon for him, as they chase Europa League qualification. Sixth place would guarantee it; seventh would be enough if Arsenal won the FA Cup. Pochettino is less keen to experience another Europa League campaign.</p> <p>Last summer, nobody could have foreseen a battle between Southampton and Tottenham \xe2\x80\x93 or even fifth-placed Liverpool, who took Lallana, Lambert and Dejan Lovren from St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s. But Saints supporters can dream of having an extremely loud last laugh.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn our 130-year history, Liverpool are the only club we have never finished above,\xe2\x80\x9d Grant says. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we came second in 1984, Liverpool were the champions. To finish above them and Spurs would be perfect.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
