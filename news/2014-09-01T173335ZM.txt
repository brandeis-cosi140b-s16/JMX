b'Manchester United transfer spree reveals extent of Old Trafford upheaval | David Conn'


b'<p>Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s shock, high-priced loan grab of the Colombian striker Radamel Falcao from his odd year out at tax-lite, thinly supported Monaco planted the transfer deadline day story where the focus has been all summer: on the tumultuous leavings and frantic arrivals at Old Trafford.</p> <p>It is acknowledged now that clubs doing huge deals as late as United have this year are not as stable or organised as their rivals \xe2\x80\x93 notably Chelsea and Manchester City \xe2\x80\x93 who have recruited players early enough to show them round, at least, before the season starts. Yet this feverish United activity, more than \xc2\xa3120m spent including the staggering \xc2\xa359.7m for \xc3\x81ngel di Mari\xc3\xada\xe2\x80\x99s left-midfield thrust, \xc2\xa36m for a season of Falcao and Daley Blind at \xc2\xa314m, goes way beyond that truth about thinness of planning. This is historic upheaval \xe2\x80\x93 as, in hindsight, the eventual retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson, like Sir Matt Busby\xe2\x80\x99s before him, was always going to be.</p> <p>How odd it is to recall Ferguson leaving 16 months ago, the 2013 Premier League won, an impregnable-seeming dynasty to pass on to his anointed heir David Moyes, a farewell statement in which Ferguson said credibly that he was leaving \xe2\x80\x9can organisation in the strongest possible shape\xe2\x80\x9d. Of the players he promised enviable continuity. \xe2\x80\x9cThe quality of this league winning squad, and the balance of ages within it, bodes well for continued success at the highest level,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhilst the structure of the youth set-up will ensure that the long-term future of the club remains a bright one.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Few foresaw anything like the crumbling which Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s leaving, and that of his chief executive David Gill, has in fact revealed, leading to Moyes\xe2\x80\x99 rapid dismissal and this summer\xe2\x80\x99s scramble for Louis van Gaal. The hectic squad stocking, pursued to the last day, has lent yet more awe to Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s managerial record: that he wrested such triumphs from a squad which, as Moyes complained in vain, actually needed major reconstruction.</p> <p>Shocked out of eight merry years re-financing and brand-sweating, United\xe2\x80\x99s US owners, the Glazers, have had to sanction their eager executive and former banker, Edward Woodward, to tear up years of restraint. Luke Shaw, a \xc2\xa327m left-back, and Ander Herrera, \xc2\xa329m, would have sufficed in a normal Ferguson years but Woodward has clattered on. He will hope that Di Mar\xc3\xada, an undoubted star acquired at a seller\xe2\x80\x99s price, the \xc2\xa316m Argentinian defender Marcos Rojo and the late coup of Falcao will reburnish the brand Woodward has sold for the Glazers to multiple sponsors from an office in Mayfair.</p> <p>His work does appear frantic compared with the strategic reinforcing by Chelsea, with the \xc2\xa330m Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas and \xc2\xa332m Diego Costa, among others, signed early, and City securing the defender Eliaquim Mangala for \xc2\xa332m, Fernando\xe2\x80\x99s midfield bite for \xc2\xa312m and more squad depth including Bacary Sagna and Frank Lampard\xe2\x80\x99s once golden legs.</p> <p>Yet there is a sadness here, too. In the rush two at United deemed as surplus stock were Danny Welbeck and Tom Cleverley, two young English players polished in the \xe2\x80\x9cyouth set-up\xe2\x80\x9d whose merits Ferguson sang. It was another of Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s distinctions that he continued to promote homegrown players through a period when his rivals mostly stopped. These deals risk ending a great Old Trafford tradition. Cleverley and Welbeck were both Ferguson first choices in the 2013 Champions League round-of-16 second leg, when United were thrillingly beating Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s Real Madrid until the turning point of Nani\xe2\x80\x99s sending-off.</p> <p>The money reaped by Premier League clubs, from the record \xc2\xa35.5bn 2013-16 Sky, BT, BBC and international TV deals, plus high-priced tickets and merchandise the fans stump up for, and layers of sponsorship, has meant more than \xc2\xa3700m spent on players this summer. The transfer window has been open between a World Cup in which England wanly flopped, and the first international since, Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s friendly against Norway, for which the FA has stacks of unwanted tickets.</p> <p>After brief, dutiful head-shaking following England\xe2\x80\x99s exit the clubs\xe2\x80\x99 response has been to spend around \xc2\xa3600m of that \xc2\xa3700m on talent from overseas. The stand-out exceptions have been the elevations from a shaken Southampton of Shaw, Calum Chambers, signed for \xc2\xa316m by Arsenal, Adam Lallana, and Rickie Lambert, bought for \xc2\xa325m and \xc2\xa34m respectively by Liverpool, where Brendan Rodgers is continuing with a core of English players. Clubs with less to spend or more modest hopes have still bought British: promoted Burnley and Leicester City; Hull City signed Tom Ince from Blackpool, Jake Livermore and the sterling Michael Dawson from Tottenham Hotspur, and Robert Snodgrass from Norwich City; Aston Villa and Sunderland have signed some, as have Southampton.</p> <p>Yet Liverpool apart, at the clubs eyeing the title and elite European competition, movement is the other way. Ryan Bertrand, who famously made his Champions League debut in Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s 2012 final victory over Bayern Munich, has gone to Southampton, his seventh club on loan in seven years since joining from Gillingham. Manchester City prided themselves at first under Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan\xe2\x80\x99s ownership on fielding a corps of England internationals, but that policy has been revised. Joleon Lescott and a largely unused Jack Rodwell left this summer, while Micah Richards, City\xe2\x80\x99s one academy graduate in the billion pound Abu Dhabi makeover, signed for Fiorentina on a season-long loan. Manuel Pellegrini went back for his former goalkeeper at Malaga, Willy Caballero, to provide competition with Joe Hart, the one English regular left in City\xe2\x80\x99s team.</p> <p>Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s late-night, heartening signing of Welbeck from United\xe2\x80\x99s sidelines prompted a surprise revelation: that after pioneering English Premier League teams with no English players, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger is now investing faith in more young British talent. Some suggested that this has followed the traumatic exits of his overseas stars, Robin van Persie, Samir Nasri and Ga\xc3\xabl Clichy to the Manchester clubs, and Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas to Barcelona.</p> <p>Transfer deadline day, the incomparable rolling soap opera, gives way now to a week of kitchen sink suffering with Roy Hodgson, lamenting modest players called up, the retirement of Lampard\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgolden generation\xe2\x80\x9d who were given first team chances young, and several England internationals no longer regulars at their globalised clubs.</p> <p>There was never going to be much of a debate after England\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup failure, despite the many lessons in Germany\xe2\x80\x99s triumph. The chances of having one now can be measured in the frenzied summer at the Glazers\xe2\x80\x99 Manchester United.</p>'
