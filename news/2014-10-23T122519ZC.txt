b'<p>Chelsea are considering playing Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle as a central striker in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Manchester United after Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my joined Diego Costa on the sidelines, with the pair struggling with groin injuries.</p> <p>R\xc3\xa9my sustained an injury while scoring his team\xe2\x80\x99s opening goal in the 6-0 midweek rout of Maribor in the Champions League and underwent scans on Wednesday to ascertain the extent of the damage. Despite the player having been initially optimistic as to his chances of featuring at the weekend, the results of those tests have confirmed he will be out for up to two weeks.</p> <p>His absence is particularly untimely given Costa\xe2\x80\x99s fitness issues. The Spain forward, who has been hampered by hamstring trouble all season, was hospitalised briefly with a stomach virus after complaining of cramps this week but, more seriously, is suffering from a groin strain apparently picked up on international duty this month. He has failed to train properly since returning to London after the Euro 2016 qualifiers against Slovakia and Luxembourg, of which he played all but eight minutes.</p> <p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho had been cryptic as to the nature of Costa\xe2\x80\x99s absence for Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s victory at Crystal Palace but did suggest the \xc2\xa332m signing from Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid had yet to overcome the hamstring problem. But, while that complaint would have required a period of rest to be cured \xe2\x80\x93 he has missed his team\xe2\x80\x99s past two games and will effectively have sat out a fortnight by the time the team visit United \xe2\x80\x93 the 26-year-old needed intensive treatment this week on the groin injury.</p> <p>That remains the main concern and, having been unable to take part in training, there is an acceptance within the club\xe2\x80\x99s medical staff that it is unlikely Costa will be able to feature at all at Old Trafford. Indeed, there is intense frustration at Cobham that a player who had been managing the hamstring complaint before the international window, scoring nine goals in seven Premier League appearances, returned from the Spain squad with an additional complaint.</p> <p>The pair\xe2\x80\x99s absence would leave Didier Drogba, who has suffered ankle injuries this term and admitted in midweek that he was short of match fitness, as the team\xe2\x80\x99s only fit senior forward against Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s team. The Ivorian veteran scored the first goal of his second spell at the club in the victory over Maribor, from the penalty spot, but has not started a Premier League game since returning to English football from Galatasaray.</p> <p>Instead, Mourinho is exploring the possibility of starting with Sch\xc3\xbcrrle as his principal forward at Old Trafford now that the World Cup winner has recovered from the bout of flu which had ruled him out of Germany\xe2\x80\x99s Euro 2016 qualifier against Scotland last week. Sch\xc3\xbcrrle began the corresponding fixture last season up front, with Mourinho much criticised for failing to field an out-and-out striker in his lineup as the game finished goalless, and a repeat remains an option.</p> <p>There is concern that Drogba, 36, would not be able to play 90 minutes at this level given his fitness concerns. The hugely promising teenager Dominic Solanke, who made his senior Chelsea debut as a substitute on Tuesday, is likely to be included in the squad which travels to Manchester and represents another alternative.</p>'
