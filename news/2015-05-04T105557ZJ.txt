b'Juventus say Paul Pogba not for sale amid interest from European elite'


b'<p>Juventus have insisted their much coveted France international Paul Pogba is not for sale this summer amid suggestions elite clubs in England and Spain are hoping to secure the midfielder when the transfer window opens.</p> <p>Pogba, who controversially moved to Turin from Manchester United three years ago, had been expected to leave Juve to enable the Italian club, who claimed a fourth successive Serie A title over the weekend and compete in the Champions League semi-final against Real Madrid on Tuesday, to rebuild an ageing squad. The 22-year-old is currently nursing a hamstring injury but hopes to return to action in time for the second leg of the tie against Real.</p> <p>The reigning European champions were one of the clubs expected to target Pogba this summer, with Barcelona having already made known their long-term interest and both Manchester United and Chelsea monitoring the Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s situation.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAt the moment Pogba is one of the best young players in the world so it\xe2\x80\x99s normal that many big clubs would set their sights on him,\xe2\x80\x9d Giuseppe Marotta, Juventus\xe2\x80\x99s director general and sports department chief executive, told RadioUno. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we, too, are a big club and we\xe2\x80\x99re not in the habit of selling our best players.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLook back over our long history and Juve have sanctioned very few sales of big-name players. And at the moment the conditions are not right to put Pogba on the market.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The player, who has 22 caps for France, is contracted at Juventus until 2019 with a price in excess of \xc2\xa375m having been mooted when he does decide the time is right to move on.</p>'
