b'Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Olivier Giroud says he is not arrogant but is in form of his life'


b'<p>Olivier Giroud believes he is in the best form of his career and that criticism does not affect him after statistics revealed that the Arsenal striker is the most prolific minute-per-goal player in the Premier League this season.</p> <p>And the 28-year-old Frenchman had a colourful riposte for those who said he was arrogant before Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s recent Champions League exit to Monaco, by using the French phrase \xe2\x80\x9cJe ne p\xc3\xa8te pas plus haut que mon cul\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 which translates as \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t fart higher than my behind.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Giroud has scored 13 times in 19 Premier League appearances in a season that was interrupted by a broken bone in his leg in August that put him on the sidelines for three months. That equates to a goal every 97 minutes, the best record of any player in the top flight.</p> <p>Giroud returned to the Arsenal side in late November, however, and has scored six goals in his last five league games to propel Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s side up to third in the table.</p> <p>Speaking at France\xe2\x80\x99s training camp for the friendly against Brazil in Paris on Thursday, Giroud told Radio Monte Carlo: \xe2\x80\x9cI am in my best period since I arrived at Arsenal. I need to continue like this, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to stop here. I scored 16 or 17 goals last year. I would like to do better and to help my team reach its aims. That is what is most important.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFinishing second or third [in the league] would be very good, even if we\xe2\x80\x99ll be ready if Chelsea slip up. Winning the FA Cup is also an objective. I am continuing my progress. I feel really good at Arsenal. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to keep improving.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Giroud was widely criticised for his performance in Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s disastrous 3-1 first-leg defeat to Monaco in the last 16 of the Champions League, where the forward missed a number of presentable chances before being substituted.</p> <p>Although he scored the opening goal in Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s 2-0 win in the return leg in Monaco last week, the damage was done at the Emirates and Arsenal went out on away goals. However, Giroud denies he was made to pay for perceived arrogance before the games against the Ligue 1 side.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI did an interview one week before the game against Monaco. We spoke about a lot of different topics and the journalist said to me: \xe2\x80\x98Giroud is not the same as Ag\xc3\xbcero and Diego Costa.\xe2\x80\x99 I simply replied that I was a good attacker, I let the statistics speak for themselves. I know who I am, I know what I say. People who know me know that I am not somebody who farts higher than \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d he smiled.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cApparently, it was not the right moment because I lacked efficiency during that game [against Monaco]. It is good to show you have mental strength in coming back stronger and I proved that the critics don\xe2\x80\x99t hurt me. I have created a shell around me, in the good and the bad moments. I know when I am good and when I am not good. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need anyone to tell me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
