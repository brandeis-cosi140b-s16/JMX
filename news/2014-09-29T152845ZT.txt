b'A COMEDY OF ERRORS <p>When the collapsible car that passes for Newcastle United\xe2\x80\x99s team bus parks up at the Britannia Stadium tonight, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be difficult to know how Alan Pardew will feel as clown after clown after clown alights. With his team bottom of the Premier League with only Burnley Nil beneath them on goal difference, the division\xe2\x80\x99s second-longest serving manager goes into tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game on the back of what seems to be the most bizarre vote of confidence in football history, after comments attributed to his employer Mike Ashley last week. Buttonholed by a journalist outside a London pub before the weekend, the normally reticent Newcastle owner revealed that should Newcastle fail to win tonight, Pardew is \xe2\x80\x9cdead .\xe2\x80\xa6 finished \xe2\x80\xa6 over\xe2\x80\x9d. Indeed, while Ashley was drinking in the The Golden Lion, it seems poor old Pards is forlornly supping in the Last Chance Saloon.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOne more game then that\xe2\x80\x99s it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ashley, who apparently accompanied his words with a throat-slitting gesture. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you do? I have spent a lot of money on that club, it\xe2\x80\x99s cost me a lot. I won\xe2\x80\x99t put up with it any more. Honestly, answer me, what would you do? One more loss and he\xe2\x80\x99s gone, he\xe2\x80\x99s over, finished.\xe2\x80\x9d Of course Ashley wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the first notoriously reticent man to become slightly less reticent after a couple of foamy and refreshing pints of Tongue Loosener, but as the Fiver was oblivious to the exchange from our place face down and unconscious in a nearby Soho gutter we have no way of knowing from his tone or demeanour whether or not he was serious.</p> <p>His lawyers are in no doubt, however, having since opted for the tried and trusted \xe2\x80\x9cbantz\xe2\x80\x9d defence and informed the employers of the reporter in question that \xe2\x80\x9cMr Ashley responded, tongue in cheek, that Mr Pardew had two more games before being sacked,\xe2\x80\x9d the paper revealed. \xe2\x80\x9cTo put this into perspective, over the past few weeks certain reporters have stated that they believe that Mr Pardew has two more games before being sacked. Mr Ashley was therefore \xe2\x80\x98humouring\xe2\x80\x99 your reporter.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Quite what poor old Pards is meant to make of this remains unclear. If Ashley really did mean what he was saying, only to backtrack furiously once he\xe2\x80\x99d seen his comments in print, he can\xe2\x80\x99t very well sack poor old Pards if Newcastle go out and get tonked tonight. If, on the other hand, he really was joking, then as a tea-timely email with a long and proud history of unsuccessful attempts at humour, the Fiver would like to recommend he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t book himself an open spot at any of Soho\xe2\x80\x99s many comedy clubs. Meanwhile, for Newcastle fans, the misery continues. They could certainly do with a giggle, but won\xe2\x80\x99t be particularly amused by their owner\xe2\x80\x99s latest comedy \xe2\x80\x9cskit\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Simon Burnton for minute-by-minute coverage of Stoke City 0-0 Newcastle United tonight at 8pm.</p> QUOTES OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe called me \xe2\x80\x98Gerd\xe2\x80\x99 and congratulated me on the \xe2\x80\x9974 final\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Thomas M\xc3\xbcller.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe was fine until I saw him acting strange. Then he came to me and said \xe2\x80\x98Manu, let me play as the goalkeeper\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Manuel Neuer.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worried at first, he played normally. But things started when he came to me and said he wanted to take the captain\xe2\x80\x99s band from my arm. I thought \xe2\x80\x98what\xe2\x80\x99s going on here\xe2\x80\x99. When he wanted to trade shirts with the ref I thought \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99s enough now\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Philipp Lahm.</p> <p>Christoph Kramer\xe2\x80\x99s Germany team-mates reveal the worrying extent to which the young midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s mind was scrambled by that bang on the head in the World Cup final before he was finally taken off.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel.

Or perhaps he was distinguishing from a moment in mathematics or physics? No, thought not. While I am on the subject of Brendan Rogers (think about it), you know that Michael Hunt, the generous offerer of old clothes, is not his real name, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ivor Biggun (and 1,056 others).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the \xe2\x80\xa6 ?
