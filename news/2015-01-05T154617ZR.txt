b"Real Madrid's run ends while Barcelona shoot themselves in the foot | Sid Lowe"


b'<p>First Valencia laid on a guard of honour for Real Madrid, then they laid into them. 2015 began with a bang and a crash. It also began in celebration, and another glimpse that a fourth power may be re-emerging in Spain. New owners, new players, new manager, new atmosphere, Valencia are on their way back: the team that defeated champions Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid and were unfortunate to lose to Barcelona in the 93rd minute began the new year by ending Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s run of 22 consecutive wins, going back almost four months. When Nicol\xc3\xa1s Otamendi\xe2\x80\x99s thumping header clinched a 2-1 victory, they roared inside Mestalla. An hour later, they were still roaring outside Mestalla, thousands gathered long after the game had ended. </p> <p>A state of optimism has been declared. The day before the game, 5,000 fans had turned up at Valencia\xe2\x80\x99s Paterna training ground and the day before that 8,000 had come to the presentation of Enzo P\xc3\xa9rez, whose arrival for \xe2\x82\xac25m from Benfica takes Valencia\xe2\x80\x99s spending under their new owner Peter Lim over \xe2\x82\xac100m. This time there was real hope. Desire, too. A banner at Paterna declared: \xe2\x80\x9cFor the mothers that gave birth to you, beat Madrid!\xe2\x80\x9d, which they did for the first time in five years at home. This morning, the headline in Super Deporte lauds: \xe2\x80\x9cThe mothers that gave birth to you!\xe2\x80\x9d </p> <p>Before the game Valencia had been obliged to line up to applaud Madrid onto the pitch for having recently won the Club World Cup. Fans weren\xe2\x80\x99t happy \xe2\x80\x93 if there is a team they dislike, it is Madrid \xe2\x80\x93 and up in the stands, some turned their backs and whistled. But the emotional management at Mestalla has been clever and here was another example. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bother us,\xe2\x80\x9d the manager Nuno Esp\xc3\xadrito Santo had insisted, \xe2\x80\x9cthe best way to recognise your own merits is to recognise those of others.\xe2\x80\x9d Almost immediately afterwards, Valencia\xe2\x80\x99s Under-12s came out, recent winners of the Arona tournament, and walked the same guard of honour. Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s moment had been just a moment, quickly replaced. The fans turned swiftly and applauded, chanting \xe2\x80\x9cChampions! Champions!\xe2\x80\x9d </p> <p>Besides, Enzo P\xc3\xa9rez had promised: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll applaud them but when the game starts it will be different.\xe2\x80\x9d </p>   <div data-embed-type="table" class="player-card player-card--football" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <div class="player-card__image-container">  </div> <div class="player-card__player"> <div class="player-card__position" itemprop="jobTitle">Defender</div> <div class="player-card__name" itemprop="name">Nicolas Otamendi</div> </div> <dl class="player-card__stats"> <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Appearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">17</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots blocked</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">9</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Clearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">25</dd> </dl> </div>   <p>As usual, Valencia came out flying. Usually, that requires them to get the first goal and kill the game off while their energy lasts. Instead, Cristiano Ronaldo opened the scoring with a penalty \xe2\x80\x93 for the fifth time this season \xe2\x80\x93 but Valencia didn\xe2\x80\x99t fold. Madrid could not escape the organisation or intensity; Valencia played with three central defenders and two wing backs, one of two systems the manager said can be \xe2\x80\x9cuseful\xe2\x80\x9d but still needs \xe2\x80\x9cperfecting\xe2\x80\x9d. Here, the organisation appeared near-perfect already. Madrid were not awful by any means, and they had chances in a game that was fast and exhilarating, that wore you out just watching it, but they did complete fewer passes than in any other match. Cristiano Ronaldo attempted just 13. Otamendi and Lucas Orban were everywhere, flying into tackles, closing every gap. </p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe key was not letting them play,\xe2\x80\x9d Nuno said, but that was not the whole story. If the first half had been bruising, packed with cards (seven of them, five for Valencia), and if the final minutes were tense, the second half had opened up and so had Valencia. The wingbacks were more wings than backs; Jos\xc3\xa9 Gay\xc3\xa1 and Antonio Barrag\xc3\xa1n combined for the equaliser. Then Otamendi got what would prove the winner. Over on the touchline, Nuno leapt and spun and shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cThe best day?\xe2\x80\x9d he said afterwards, repeating a line he had used after Valencia beat Atl\xc3\xa9tico. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m an optimist and I keep saying that I believe that the best day is in the future. This is just the start.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>For Madrid, it was the end. The end of the run, anyway; the surprise was that it was not the end of their time on the top of the table. Coritiba, holders of the world record for consecutive wins, quickly put out a message. \xe2\x80\x9cThanks Valencia,\xe2\x80\x9d it said. For Madrid there may be some concerns: they have not played as well without Luka Modric, even if they have kept winning, and the front three disappeared almost entirely, while some worry that the lack of rotation may cost them. But Ancelotti was calm as ever. \xe2\x80\x9cIt had to happen sooner or later,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, voice barely audible over the chanting coming from beyond the walls, where Valencia fans were gathering to celebrate, chanting and bouncing up and down. </p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe weren\xe2\x80\x99t singing before and nor are we going to throw in the towel now,\xe2\x80\x9d Sergio Ramos added. </p> <p>As it turned out, he was more right than he could have imagined; the pessimism passed in a matter of hours. When Real Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s bus left Mestalla last night it nudged its way slowly through the thousands of fans that had gathered to cheer the team that had finally defeated them, before pulling out onto Avenida Suecia and heading towards Manises airport, where the players boarded the plane thinking that they had lost top spot in the league. But by the time they had got off at Barajas, reached Valdebebas and climbed into their cars to head home, turning on the radio to listen to the last few, dramatic minutes of the night\xe2\x80\x99s final game, FC Barcelona had helpfully handed it back. </p>      Pos Team P GD Pts      1 Real Madrid 16 41 39    2 Barcelona 17 33 38    3 Atletico Madrid 17 19 38    4 Valencia 17 17 34    5 Sevilla 16 9 33       <p>For the first time since September, Madrid had been beaten. But for the first time since April 2011 Barcelona had been beaten too, in the same week. An own goal from Jordi Alba after ninety seconds \xe2\x80\x93 the fastest own goal in their history \xe2\x80\x93 saw them lose 1-0 to David Moyes\xe2\x80\x99s Real Sociedad at Anoeta. Instead of climbing back to the top, they still trail Real Madrid, having played a game more. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lost opportunity,\xe2\x80\x9d Andr\xc3\xa9s Iniesta said. La Vanguardia called it \xe2\x80\x9cthe road to hell.\xe2\x80\x9d They didn\xe2\x80\x99t like where this is heading. </p> <p>Leo Messi, Neymar, Dani Alves, Gerard Piqu\xc3\xa9 and Ivan Rakitic were all left on the bench. Messi, Neymar and Alves had all arrived back from Christmas just two days before. All of them came on in the second half but still there was no way through and nor did it ever really look like there would be, even if Moyes did admit that when the goal went in he turned to Billy McKinley and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe could do with the full time whistle now.\xe2\x80\x9d Sure, there were saves, and a couple of penalty shouts, but Barcelona did not play well. \xe2\x80\x9cLuis Enrique throws away three points,\xe2\x80\x9d complained the cover of Sport. </p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to risk them,\xe2\x80\x9d Luis Enrique said afterwards, as if they had just turned up late, unannounced. The decision was, in fact, his \xe2\x80\x93 on the grounds that they have the Copa Am\xc3\xa9rica at the end of the season. Unlike, say, Javier Mascherano or Claudio Bravo. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity,\xe2\x80\x9d lamented El Mundo Deportivo. Marca called it \xe2\x80\x9csuicide.\xe2\x80\x9d The cause of death: \xe2\x80\x9cLuis Enrique shot himself in the foot,\xe2\x80\x9d said AS.</p> <p>In fairness to Luis Enrique, once they had come back two days later than the rest, perhaps leaving them on the bench was logical, but he had insisted before the game that they were all \xe2\x80\x9cfresh and fit.\xe2\x80\x9d And anyway, here\xe2\x80\x99s an idea: if it is a risk to play someone who has got back late, don\xe2\x80\x99t decide to let your best players come back late in the first place. Equally, letting Messi come back late and not starting him in the first game in January is nothing new: Pep Guardiola did it four years in a row and Tata Martino did the same. </p> <p>But it\xe2\x80\x99s a little different when you\xe2\x80\x99re going away to Anoeta, where you have not won for five years; when Real Madrid have just unexpectedly handed you a rare chance to close the gap; and when leaving them out is just another indication of a much deeper problem; when for much of the season only Messi and Neymar have hidden how poorly your team is playing; when Barcelona have no identity and when know one knows what the system is except that the system is Messi. This was Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s 17th league game and their 17th different lineup. </p> <p>It is also a little different when the club is adrift at boardroom level and fractured socially \xe2\x80\x93 with football director Andoni Zubizaretta sacked; when after the game, the sporting director, so often the shield for his superiors, publicly points the finger at the president for the first time; when the current regime is getting less popular by the day; when this team has come off the back of a first trophyless season in five years; when there are new players who need to settle swiftly; when the manger had already claimed weeks ago it is \xe2\x80\x9chunting season\xe2\x80\x9d and now the knifes are out more than ever before; and when it widens fault lines that are already opening up. </p> <p>On Monday morning Barcelona had a special open training session for kids to attend in celebration of Kings Day, when the three wise men supposedly reached Bethlehem carrying gold, frankincense and myrrh. Messi missed it. He had gastroenteritis, they said.</p> <p>Up in San Sebasti\xc3\xa1n and down in Valencia, they were nursing sore heads. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the happiest day since I have been here,\xe2\x80\x9d Moyes admitted, while El Diario Vasco called it a \xe2\x80\x9cmagical night.\xe2\x80\x9d Nuno was trying to keep a lid on the euphoria. \xe2\x80\x9cI keep saying this, to the point of become a bore,\xe2\x80\x9d he insisted after Valencia\xe2\x80\x99s victory. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there are any celebrations, they will only be at the end.\xe2\x80\x9d Outside, the fans didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear him. They were too busy celebrating. </p> Talking points     The Real Sociedad coach David Moyes helped steer his club to victory over Barcelona. Photograph: David Ramos/Getty Images    <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Happy hogmanay. The opening weekend of 2015 was a special one for Scottish coaches. Sitting next to Nuno on the Valencia bench was his assistant Ian Cathro, while up in San Sebasti\xc3\xa1n, Real Sociedad\xe2\x80\x99s win over Barcelona means they have now beaten Real Madrid, Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid and Barcelona ... (plus Oviedo, of course). Those three victories have come under three different managers, the latest of them of David Moyes, whose Real Sociedad side have now scored in the opening three minutes three home games in a row.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Things could hardly have gone better for Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid, for whom this was a nine-point weekend, drawing them to within a point of the top, and who in 24 hours welcomed 90,000 people and one icon into the stadium. The Kid is back at the Calder\xc3\xb3n. Fernando Torres was signed last week. On Saturday, he sat in the directors\xe2\x80\x99 box at the Calder\xc3\xb3n as Atl\xc3\xa9tico defeated Levante 3-1, with Antoine Griezmann scoring twice and celebrating by doing the archer gesture that Torres always did in homage of Kiko (whose No19 shirt he has taken). And then on Sunday he was presented in the same stadium ... and over 40,00 turned up to welcome him home. \xe2\x80\x9cOne day you\xe2\x80\x99ll have to tell me what I have done to deserve this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, holding the mic.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 The first half of Elche-Villarreal: fun.</p> <p> \xe2\x80\xa2 There is a box on Getafe\xe2\x80\x99s web site which says \xe2\x80\x9cget your tickets here.\xe2\x80\x9d When you click on it takes you to a new page ... which is empty. How sadly appropriate.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Speaking of Getafe, it\xe2\x80\x99s not unusual to have to get rid of someone because of your financial crisis. But when that someone is your manager, you know something is seriously wrong. </p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 New year, same Eibar. They just keep on keeping on. </p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Sevilla beat Celta.
