b'Kak\xc3\xa1 and Robinho return as Brazil step into past for Argentina friendly'


b'<p>There is a centenary approaching in Brazil, but it is not something anyone in a yellow shirt will be celebrating. On 16 October, it will be 100 days since that game, since the Sele\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o played Germany and were thrashed in the semi-finals of the World Cup they were hosting. It was Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s joint-biggest defeat, one that deserved the BBC\xe2\x80\x99s vidiprinter treatment: 7 (seven)-1, and hopes of a sixth cup ended in humiliating style.</p> <p>After the nightmare of the Mineir\xc3\xa3o, the CBF, the governing body of Brazilian football, had to react. And the reaction has been a curious mixture of one eye on the past, one eye on the future. Luiz Felipe Scolari, the manager, resigned soon after the World Cup final but the changes could not stop there.</p> <p>Dunga, Kak\xc3\xa1, Robinho: these were three of the people who were supposed to win that sixth World Cup for Brazil when they were in South Africa four years ago. Then, their hopes were snuffed out by Holland in the quarter-finals. On Saturday that trio is together again for the friendly against Argentina \xe2\x80\x93 the Supercl\xc3\xa1sico de las Am\xc3\xa9ricas \xe2\x80\x93 in the Bird\xe2\x80\x99s Nest stadium in Beijing.</p> <p>Dunga resigned after the defeat to Holland. He had four years in charge that brought one Copa Am\xc3\xa9rica, in 2007, but otherwise produced a team in his rather dour image. So, after the shock of the 7-1 defeat, and with the Sele\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o in need of a serious shake-up, few imagined Dunga would apply for the job vacated by Scolari. Even fewer imagined he would get it.</p> <p>Juca Kfouri, a respected Brazilian football journalist, summed up the mood when he wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cSamuel Johnson said that a second marriage was a triumph of hope over experience. And that is exactly what the CBF has done with Dunga\xe2\x80\x99s appointment.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Dunga, in Portuguese, translates as Dopey, one of the seven dwarfs, and Kfouri adds: \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe the CBF fixed upon the number seven in homage to the German world champions.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Dunga was regarded as bottom of a list that included Zico and Tite, who guided Corinthians to victory against Chelsea in the Club World Cup in 2012. But Dunga is not the arrogant manager of four years ago. He is more polite and reasonable with the Brazilian media and some of his choices for his squads have been met with pleasant surprise, even if the performances and results have been pedestrian: 1-0 wins against Ecuador and Colombia last month.</p> <p>To his credit he has called up Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Philippe Coutinho, who Scolari ignored, and other exciting midfielders: Elias, from Corinthians, and Everton Ribeiro and Ricardo Goulart, both from Cruzeiro, who are top of the Brazilian league. Two casualties of the World Cup have been Dani Alves and Marcelo, and despite including Maicon last month, Dunga is experimenting with younger full-backs, such as Dod\xc3\xb4, of Internazionale, who is 22. Maicon did not help his cause when he was sent home last month for returning late to the team hotel. And if it was a shock when Robinho was involved last month, the main talking point now is the recall of Kak\xc3\xa1.</p> <p>The World Footballer of the Year in 2007 last played for Brazil early last year. Now on loan at S\xc3\xa3o Paulo, before he joins Orlando City next year, he has been in impressive form for his club. Calls for him to be selected for the World Cup, while he was at Milan, never rose above a murmur, so his choice has been given a lukewarm reception, unsurprisingly. Tost\xc3\xa3o, one of Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s great World Cup-winning team of 1970, and a long-standing newspaper columnist, is not in favour. \xe2\x80\x9cKak\xc3\xa1 is no better than anyone else in the squad,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. Finding a strike partner for Neymar should be the priority, he feels.</p> <p>Kak\xc3\xa1 is 32 and Robinho is 30 and although the Copa Am\xc3\xa9rica next year, and the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 are in sight, the next World Cup is the only serious objective for the Sele\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o. Tost\xc3\xa3o says: \xe2\x80\x9cWith Russia in mind, they should never be picked.\xe2\x80\x9d But some believe there is an argument to include them. \xe2\x80\x9cKak\xc3\xa1 and Robinho [at Santos] have found their form since they returned to Brazil. It is as if they had never been away,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Antero Greco, in the newspaper Estado de S\xc3\xa3o Paulo. \xe2\x80\x9cFootball, like life, has surprises, and maybe these two will overcome expectations. Good for them, and hopefully it will be equally good for the team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>But while Dunga watches from the dugout in Beijing, what of Scolari? He was not out of work for long. Thanks to a friendship with Fabio Koff, the president of Gr\xc3\xaamio, in early August he rejoined the club where he made his name, 20 years ago, and they sit fourth in the league, in the Copa Libertadores places, largely thanks to a recent run of 21 points from nine games, with eight consecutive clean sheets. Not a 7-1 in there. It seems someone has learnt something in the last 100 days.</p>'
