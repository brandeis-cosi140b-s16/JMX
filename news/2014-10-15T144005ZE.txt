b'Everton need rapid resumption of last season\xe2\x80\x99s form after the break'


b'<p>Even with the novel and quite jolly diversion of Euro 2016 qualifying matches staggered through most days of the week this has seemed a long international break. Not only did England play two undistinguished opponents and put in two undistinguished performances, they played their last game on Sunday, leaving a whole week with not much to do but consider Raheem Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s fatigue or Roy Keane\xe2\x80\x99s motivation for writing another book.</p> <p>At least Keane\xe2\x80\x99s collaboration with Roddy Doyle and subsequent round of interviews were entertaining. The largely fabricated club v country argument around Sterling was a pointless exercise that just made one wish something more interesting would turn up soon, like football games. For supporters of Premier League clubs the wait is nearly over, though for some of those clubs the wait must have seemed agonisingly long.</p> <p>It is commonly accepted wisdom in football, or at least managers say it so often that it must be true, that a good result is vital going into an international break, since a bad one will simply leave the team regretting its mistakes and stewing over what went wrong without an immediate opportunity to put things right on the pitch. The whole point of a league season, as originally envisaged, is that games come along on a regular basis and what is good one week can be bad the next, and vice versa.</p> <p>Overlong stoppages for international football tend to upset that rhythm and this season, in particular, does not yet seem to have properly started.</p> <p>Consulting a league table for the first time in ages reveals that Premier League teams have played just seven games since the season began in mid-August \xe2\x80\x93 please, no tiredness jokes \xe2\x80\x93 and that Chelsea, Spurs, Liverpool, Sunderland, West Ham and Hull, along with both Manchester teams, gained the win last time out necessary to keep spirits up during the fallow fortnight.</p> <p>That means there were eight losers too, though not necessarily eight despondent and dejected losers. There was no particular disgrace in Arsenal failing to beat Chelsea, for example, or West Brom losing at Anfield after giving a decent account of themselves. No, the teams that will have enjoyed the international break the least are the sides in the bottom six of the table who also happened to lose their last game, for the most part clubs who would have been expecting to be doing better by now and must have spent the past couple of weeks fretting over whether things were going to get any worse.</p> <p>Everton are the prime example. Not only are they fourth from bottom with six points, they have managed only one win all season and have conceded 16 goals, more than anyone else in the division. Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez, who failed to strike anyone as a defensive mastermind during his ultimately flawed tenure at Wigan, has been hit by a perfect storm of backline problems. Seamus Coleman has been injured and now John Stones is out for months. Sylvain Distin is 36 and beginning to show it, just as Tim Howard, after rising to global prominence at the World Cup, appears to have left some of his reliability and reactions in Brazil. Phil Jagielka and Leighton Baines also seem to have taken a while to readjust to domestic football, and disruption as much as anything else has resulted in a defence suddenly leaking goals.</p> <p>Events at the other end of the pitch are not going entirely as Everton would like either, with Romelu Lukaku not looking quite the player he was last season and Kevin Mirallas also joining Ross Barkley on the injury list; but it is the defensive frailty that supporters will be worried about. Though last season was a wonderful success from almost every viewpoint, if this had been Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s first campaign he would now be facing criticism and under pressure. The only good news, now that Everton have shown they are not going to win at Old Trafford every year, is that the five home games up to Boxing Day all seem winnable, along with one or two of the away games.</p> <p>If Everton are still stuck at the wrong end of the table by mid-December there could be trouble ahead. Averaging a point a game was not good enough for Wigan in the end, and it is certainly not what Goodison was expecting after the giddy heights of last season and the record expenditure on Lukaku.</p> <p>Crystal Palace and Stoke are doing only slightly better than Everton, and lost at Hull and Sunderland respectively last time out. After beating Everton away, Palace probably had higher expectations of their trip to Humberside, though whatever the result they would have had an uneasy international break. When their fixtures resume this weekend it is with the visit of Chelsea, with games against Manchester United and Liverpool to follow in November.</p> <p>Arguably expectations are no longer as great at Selhurst Park since the departure of Tony Pulis, before whom there were almost no expectations at all, but Mark Hughes guided Stoke to their highest Premier League position last season and must have been hoping for better than home defeats by Aston Villa and Leicester City, even if that stunning win at Manchester City came in between. Hughes will not have enjoyed this international break, but it is the next one he really needs to worry about. After the break in mid-November, when England play Slovenia and then Scotland, Stoke play Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal in the space of a week.</p> <p>Below Everton are Newcastle, Burnley and Queens Park Rangers. It seems idle to speculate on how much Alan Pardew enjoyed the international break when his life has been one of day-to-day survival for several months now. Newcastle play by their own rules, they do things differently to everyone else, but a win at home to Leicester on Saturday is now as vital as Mike Ashley allegedly made out last month\xe2\x80\x99s (losing) trip to Stoke to be. After Leicester the next two games for Newcastle are Tottenham away and Liverpool at home, and a team reaching mid-November without a Premier League win is in clear danger of relegation, no matter whose rules they are following.</p> <p>Burnley are also awaiting their first win, though picking up a late point at Leicester last time out was encouraging. All too predictably the spirit is there in Sean Dyche\xe2\x80\x99s team, but more goals are required. The Clarets have scored only four all season, and injury to Danny Ings has not helped.</p> <p>Dyche is being linked with Jozy Altidore, the Sunderland striker whose scoring figures on the other side of the Atlantic are quite impressive \xe2\x80\x93 23 goals in 73 appearances for the national team, 16 in 41 at club level \xe2\x80\x93 but who has managed a much more meagre four in 60 games on these shores. With or without a new striker Burnley fans appear to have accepted all along that this season would be a struggle, and probably one without a happy ending. The club simply have not spent enough money to convince anyone they have serious designs on survival. Looking at the state of neighbours Blackpool and Bolton, who can blame them?</p> <p>QPR have spent money, and to be at the foot of the table below Burnley is unacceptable, which is why bookmakers have spent the international break slashing their odds on Harry Redknapp being the next manager out. Redknapp is nothing if not durable, and seems to have survived for now, though he chose a bad time to bring a book out. Not only are his team in bottom place, testing the market\xe2\x80\x99s patience for I-nearly-signed-so-and-so stories, but Keane and Kevin Pietersen obliterated him on the publicity front.</p> <p>In literary circles at least, Redknapp is yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s man. Whether he turns out to be as dispensable in Premier League terms could depend to a large extent on the four QPR fixtures between this international break and the next. Which are, reading from left to right: Liverpool (h), Aston Villa (h), Chelsea (a), Manchester City (h). Never mind the resumption of domestic football, Redknapp probably feels it is the January transfer window that is impossibly far away. Everton supporters might be concerned, Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s furious and Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s resigned, but for QPR and their fans the wait must have seemed the longest.</p>'
