b'Premier League transfer targets \xe2\x80\x93 who is still available in Europe? | Jacob Steinberg'


b'1 Radamel Falcao, Monaco \xc2\xa340m <p>The Colombia forward has been at Monaco for a year and missed the World Cup with a serious knee injury but rumours have swirled around all summer that he is heading to Real Madrid. Do the European champions need Falcao, given that they have Cristiano Ronaldo, James Rodr\xc3\xadguez, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema? No, but when has that put them off in the past? As long as Falcao has recovered sufficiently, he is a guaranteed source of goals and he knows the Spanish capital well after a fruitful spell with Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid. It will take a lot of money to prise him away from Monaco, though.</p> 2 Sami Khedira, Real Madrid \xc2\xa320m <p>Seemingly out of favour at the Bernab\xc3\xa9u after the arrival of his Germany team-mate, Toni Kroos, and in the last year of his contract, the defensive midfielder is likely to be sold, with Arsenal, Chelsea and Bayern Munich all thought to be interested in him. Khedira\xe2\x80\x99s pedigree is not in question: he was won everything during his four seasons with Madrid and is a world champion. Someone will be getting a very good player.</p> 3 Arturo Vidal, Juventus \xc2\xa335m <p>Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s chase for the brilliant Chilean midfielder has been as close as we have come to a transfer saga this summer but it remains to be seen whether they have the means or the will \xe2\x80\x93 or even the nous \xe2\x80\x93 to prise him away from Juventus. Vidal, who has struggled with a knee injury recently, has not kicked up a fuss and would not have a problem with staying at the Italian champions. Yet he would undoubtedly reinvigorate United\xe2\x80\x99s plodding midfield.</p> 4 William Carvalho ,Sporting Lisbon \xc2\xa330m <p>David Moyes targeted the Portuguese while he was in charge at Old Trafford but Louis van Gaal seems less keen, opening the door for Arsenal to make a move for a tough, uncompromising screening midfielder.</p> 5 Danny Welbeck ,Manchester United \xc2\xa315m <p>United fans were aghast to hear that one of their favourites has been told by Van Gaal that he can leave in order to seek regular first-team football. A homegrown talent, Welbeck has pace and intelligence but is let down by a lack of a killer instinct in front of goal. But the 23-year-old forward would be a useful addition for Arsenal or Tottenham Hotspur.</p> 6 Juan Cuadrado ,Fiorentina \xc2\xa320m <p>The 26-year-old impressed during Colombia\xe2\x80\x99s run to the World Cup quarter-finals and has been a target for United. He plays on the right and could easily fit into Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s 3-5-2 system. Cuadrodo is a tricky and quick winger, although he has an erratic streak and can sometimes frustrate with his decision-making in the final third.</p> 7 Daley Blind ,Ajax \xc2\xa315m <p>Van Gaal knows Blind well from his time as Holland manager. Blind started the World Cup as a left wing-back and provided the assist for Robin van Persie\xe2\x80\x99s seal-like header in the 5-1 win over Spain but he showed his versatility by later moving into the middle.</p> 8 Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my ,Queens Park Rangers \xc2\xa38.5m <p>The Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s move to Liverpool fell through after he failed a medical and Harry Redknapp is desperate to keep him at Loftus Road. Remy could make the difference for QPR in their battle for survival. Yet he has a buy-out clause in his contract (\xc2\xa38.5m for a Champions League club, more for those not in the elite) and Arsenal and Tottenham are after a striker. At that price R\xc3\xa9my would be a relatively low-risk signing despite the concerns over his fitness.</p> 9 Mehdi Benatia ,Roma \xc2\xa330m <p>The 27-year-old Moroccan caught the eye in Serie A last season, his performances helping Rudi Garc\xc3\xada\xe2\x80\x99s Roma finish second. Benatia seems determined to leave Roma now, though, and Bayern, who need a new centre-back, have been linked with him. However, they have not agreed a fee yet and that could open the door for a Premier League club. Arsenal, Chelsea and United have all been linked with him.</p> 10 Jackson Mart\xc3\xadnez ,Porto \xc2\xa330m <p>The striker did not have a hugely productive World Cup for Colombia but he was the top scorer in the Portuguese league last season, scoring 20 times for Porto. Arsenal need more cover for Olivier Giroud, who was overworked at times last season. Perhaps Mart\xc3\xadnez fits the bill.</p>'
