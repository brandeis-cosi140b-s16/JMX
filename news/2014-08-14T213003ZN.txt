b'No strings to Everton\xe2\x80\x99s Christian Atsu loan deal, says Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez'


b'<p>Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez insists Everton\xe2\x80\x99s fruitful business relationship with Chelsea does not include a tacit agreement with the Stamford Bridge club over the futures of Ross Barkley or John Stones.</p> <p>Everton concluded a third deal inside 12 months with Chelsea on Wednesday when Christian Atsu arrived at Goodison Park on a season-long loan. The two clubs arranged an identical deal for Romelu Lukaku last summer and finalised a permanent move for the Belgium international last month for an Everton record transfer fee of \xc2\xa328m.</p> <p>For their part, Chelsea were interested in the rising young talents Barkley and Stones before the England pair signed new four- and five-year contracts respectively this summer. Those contracts, plus a new deal for Seamus Coleman, demonstrated Everton\xe2\x80\x99s intent to build a young, Champions League-chasing squad under Mart\xc3\xadnez and the manager has insisted co-operation over Atsu and Lukaku will not enhance Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s prospects of one day acquiring his England internationals.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Everton manager when asked if Chelsea wanted first option on Barkley and Stones during the transfer negotiations. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a good relationship and a professional relationship and I want to believe that Chelsea feel they can trust us in sending players out on loan. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that relationship goes any further.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe chairman [Bill Kenwright] has been instrumental in forging that relationship more than anyone. He has developed that bridge between the two clubs and there is a possibility for both to use it in a good way, but there is no commitment of any sort on future deals.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As was the case when Lukaku initially joined on loan, Everton do not have an option to sign Atsu on a permanent basis should his stay on Merseyside prove a success. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is just an arrangement that suits all three parties,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mart\xc3\xadnez. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we just hope he is a better player in 10 months\xe2\x80\x99 time.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Everton\xe2\x80\x99s manager has monitored the 22-year-old, who impressed for Ghana at the World Cup in Brazil, since his emergence at Porto but admits the winger needs time to adapt to what will be his first Premier League campaign following a season on loan at Vitesse Arnhem. \xe2\x80\x9cChristian hasn\xe2\x80\x99t played in the Premier League before so needs an adaptation period but because he has been working with an English club I feel that period will be shorter.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe is a penetrating player, you want to see him involved with the ball, and, unusually for a winger his link-up play with his team-mates is very good. I saw good signs when he came through at Porto and now he is a young man with incredible experience after the World Cup.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Atsu\xe2\x80\x99s move to Goodison was in doubt a fortnight ago but the winger denies that concern over the amount of games he will play was the complication. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody has promised me that I will play in any games,\xe2\x80\x9d said the winger. \xe2\x80\x9cI spoke with the manager here and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell me that if I come to Everton I will play straight away. I know everything depends on me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The player has to work hard before the manager can choose him. There was no guaranteed playing time.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Ghanaian is the latest of many young players to be farmed out on loan by Chelsea, but he insists he can have a future at Stamford Bridge under Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not impossible to break through at Chelsea,\xe2\x80\x9d said Atsu. \xe2\x80\x9cFor me, everything is possible. I have to work hard in everything, to get more playing time here at Everton, prove myself and also move the team forward.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI also made the decision to go out on loan. I spoke with the manager [Mourinho] and said I think it is best I get some experience on loan. The Chelsea manager supported me. It was a decision we all made together. For me it is the best option.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mart\xc3\xadnez, meanwhile, remains in the market for another striker and is interested in re-signing Lacina Traor\xc3\xa9 on loan, although Monaco want an inflated permanent fee for the Ivory Coast international.</p>'
