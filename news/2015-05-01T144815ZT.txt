b'The Fiver | A point where we\xe2\x80\x99ve reached maximum hype'


b'<p>AH, THE USUAL</p> <p>Occasionally, The Fiver is made aware, often through another Tin-inspired fug of regret and recrimination, that there is such a thing as Other Sport. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see now \xe2\x80\xa6 there\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98cricket\xe2\x80\x99, a sport where people wearing silly clothes hit balls with sticks, \xe2\x80\x98golf\xe2\x80\x99, a sport where people wearing silly clothes hit balls with sticks and \xe2\x80\x98rugby\xe2\x80\x99, a sport where people wearing silly clothes drink 14 Toby jugs of Bombardier through someone\xe2\x80\x99s jock strap, rake each other in the face with some studs but it\xe2\x80\x99s all OK because they have another Toby jug of Bombardier together afterwards and shake hands because they\xe2\x80\x99re all such bloody good blokes. </p> <p>There\xe2\x80\x99s also \xe2\x80\x98boxing\xe2\x80\x99, a sport where one man who has been arrested or cited seven times for violence against five different women and a bloke who\xe2\x80\x99s composed and sung his own theme tune are paid absurd amounts of coin to belt each other round the head for a bit. You\xe2\x80\x99d have to be even deeper in a Tin-inspired fug of regret and recrimination than The Fiver not to have noticed that there\xe2\x80\x99s quite a big boxing thing happening this weekend. Frankly, the deafening hype has already made us bored of it but worry ye not, because there isn\xe2\x80\x99t just one pugilistic encounter between a wily campaigner and an arguably more talented but undeniably less pleasant opponent. In football, though, scraps are not contested for anything as gauche as money or a shiny bauble, but respect. R.E.S.P.E.C.T. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger knows what it means to me, but according to him and his finger-wagging, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho is runnin\xe2\x80\x99 out of foolin\xe2\x80\x99.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think I just told you that the biggest thing for a manager is to respect other managers,\xe2\x80\x9d whinged Wenger today. \xe2\x80\x9cSome people have to improve on that,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, before flouncing off to the Chelsea training ground to pin a note on the fridge warning \xe2\x80\x9csome people\xe2\x80\x9d to put the lid back on the milk and asking why \xe2\x80\x9csome people\xe2\x80\x9d couldn\xe2\x80\x99t rinse out the sink after shaving their dreamily handsome face. Wenger was miffed about Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s declaration that going more than a decade without a league title was boring, rather than Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s style of play, a clear nonsense because, as The Fiver knows all too well, more than a decade of frustration, failure and multiple Tin-inspired fugs of regret and recrimination is many things, but not boring.</p> <p>Of course, like weary tattle-tales who\xe2\x80\x99d rather be writing that novel than plastering on a fake smile and ploughing through this mire one more time, the hacks of the nation were obliged to scuttle back to Mourinho and ask him whether he thought he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t given Wenger any R.E.S.P.E.C.T, grimly hoping the Chelsea man would sock it to him. Alas and alack, they were silently and airily dismissed by Jos\xc3\xa9 with a tired shake of the head and an irked waft of the hand, like an ageing viceroy in the Raj shooing away a waiter who\xe2\x80\x99d served him an unsatisfactory bowl of mulligatawny soup.</p> <p>A manager unwilling to perpetuate a continuing argument like this shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really be surprising, and indeed should be welcome for the cloud of guff it saves us from, but this is Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho, for heck\xe2\x80\x99s sake. This is a man who thrives on conflict, who feeds off the slinging of mud, who lives on beef. When even he\xe2\x80\x99s tired of a public spat, then we know it\xe2\x80\x99s become truly tedious. Perhaps, like the Other Sport of boxing, we\xe2\x80\x99ve now come to a point where we\xe2\x80\x99ve reached maximum hype, that there is no further we can go to fuel two men\xe2\x80\x99s dislike for each other. Or perhaps the only thing left for them to do is don some gloves, get in the ring and decide this whole thing via the method of the sweet science. We\xe2\x80\x99re taking Jos\xc3\xa9 in seven.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAt the end-of-season dinner the other night I was stood in the toilet and a guy went through every scenario: \xe2\x80\x98But we\xe2\x80\x99ll win and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll play Norwich and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll win and we\xe2\x80\x99ll get in the Premier League!\xe2\x80\x99 It was a nice bit of positive mental attitude, but I think he might have had a few sherbets as well. I said: \xe2\x80\x98I tell you what, standing in a toilet on a Tuesday night having a slash is not going to work it out for us. It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to make it happen. We might just have to do a little bit of work on the training ground\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Mick McCarthy, er, rains on an Ipswich fan\xe2\x80\x99s parade.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDue to a wondrously misspent youth I have a condition (self-diagnosed \xe2\x80\x93 let\xe2\x80\x99s call it Champ Man syndrome) whereby whenever I read or hear the names of players of a certain vintage, rather than picturing their face, I picture their Championship Manager 93-94 player profile (see Big Website\xe2\x80\x99s very own quiz). Anyway, David Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s mention of Ruel Fox and Andy Sinton (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters) got me daydreaming again about that glorious game. And then things got all spooky on me; I don\xe2\x80\x99t always click on your final link, but today I did. Lo and behold, in among all the games was that Ron Atkinson-esque chap pointing his finger at me, daring me to make that daydream reality. Well, there goes my long weekend\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 William Beckingsale.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday\xe2\x80\x99s letter from David Lambert re: the Daniel Sturridge-shaped hole got me wondering \xe2\x80\xa6 could you fit the entire Wise, Spencer, Stein-era Chelsea into a Neville Southall-sized hole?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Mike Pinnock.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFor reasons too boring to share here, I am nearly half a year behind on my Fivers, which is why I just this week read the 4 December 2014 edition in which Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini is quoted as not having said: \xe2\x80\x98Wake me up in May, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see where we are then.\xe2\x80\x99 Even noting that this was an authorial flourish and not an actual quote, can someone nudge Manny from his nap?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ryan Jones.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThanks to James Thompson for \xe2\x80\x98The Charlie Austin Bin Situation\xe2\x80\x99 (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s letters). I now have a name for my bearded vest-wearing hipster banjo-and-jug band\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Todd Van Allen.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOK, so I declare an interest: I\xe2\x80\x99m a Leicester City supporter (as if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know). But the reaction to Nigel Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98ostrich\xe2\x80\x99 argument with that journalist has been so over-the-top it\xe2\x80\x99s unreal \xe2\x80\x93 including yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver. Pearson was asked a stupid question (\xe2\x80\x98What went wrong tonight?\xe2\x80\x99) within half an hour of the match ending, and he said some stupid things. He apologised \xe2\x80\x93 in public and private \xe2\x80\x93 and his apology was accepted by the journalist. That should have been the end of it, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t. So will you publish a further report on his conversation with Pat Murphy of the BBC, after he apologised in public? When Murphy called him a bully, paranoid, in need of anger management, and making a fool of himself at press conferences? What is that all about? I would love to have seen the reaction if he had asked the same questions of Lord Ferg or Brian Clough. I know you won\xe2\x80\x99t publish this, but just writing it has got it off my chest.

His performances for Chelsea this season have been nothing short of outstanding.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>After cooking his Newcastle team\xe2\x80\x99s dinner, sweeping the St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park corridors, cleaning the bogs and manning the ticket office, John Carver took the reserves down to Derby County, where he had a chat with the man most likely to replace him next season. \xe2\x80\x9c[Second-Choice Steve] didn\xe2\x80\x99t mention this job, absolutely 100% not, he just asked how I was dealing with it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carver, before getting back to polishing Paul Dummett\xe2\x80\x99s boots.</p> <p>You\xe2\x80\x99d never guess Big Vote was round the corner dept: Labour reckon the state of grassroots football is \xe2\x80\x98a disgrace\xe2\x80\x99, the Tories want cheaper match-day tickets and the Lib Dems want safe-standing but no one listens to them anymore so good luck with that one.</p> <p>Mauricio Pochettino is trying to lure Marseille\xe2\x80\x99s Andr\xc3\xa9 Ayew to Spurs when his contract expires this summer with a bit of frantic eyelash fluttering on Skype, according to French football website Foot365, which even the Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s snooty, cheese-eating, white flag-waving, beret-wearing, love-making, Gauloises-smoking, wine-drinking cousin Thierry En Face De La Cinema Fiver hasn\xe2\x80\x99t heard of. But there.</p> <p>Brendan Rodgers has peered through that Daniel Sturridge-shaped hole in the Liverpool physio table and declared: \xe2\x80\x9cI think we have found some underlying issues\xe2\x80\x9d with the striker, who has been packed off to USA!
