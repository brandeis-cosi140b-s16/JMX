b'The Fiver | Over-elaborate concepts of negativity'


b'<p>ZLATAN BATTLES THE BLUE ROBOTS</p> <p>In 1997, psychedelic rockers The Flaming Lips released an experimental album called Zaireeka. It was spread over four compact discs, and the idea was that you played all the discs at the same time in four separate CD players. A dissonant yet sensual sonic landscape, it was hailed as an avant-garde masterpiece, albeit very much one for the connoisseur. At which point the band changed tack, whacked out a few catchy pop singles, and became one of the most popular beat combos of the early 2000s.</p> <p>There may be a moral in this story for Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho, who last night rejected the stultifying mores of everyday football to unveil 11 separate envelope-pushing contemporary dance pieces simultaneously: Man Walking To Shops; Man Sauntering To Shops; Man Popping Down To Shops; Man Sighing While Waiting For Bus; Man Taking Dog To Park; Man Yawning; Man Yawning While Scratching Arse; Man Ambling Down Stairs To Pick Up Post And Paper From Doormat; Man Considering Making Nice Pot Of Tea; Manchester United Surround Andy D\xe2\x80\x99Urso (Homage To West Side Story); and Man Strolling Back From Shops With Fag On.</p> <p>Unlike the similarly structured Zaireeka, the resulting m\xc3\xa9lange was not a critical success. None of it fitted together, most of it meandered aimlessly in different directions, and the only high-tempo section jarred alarmingly and managed to annoy just about everyone. \xe2\x80\x9cIt felt like I had a lot of babies around me,\xe2\x80\x9d reminisced Parisian artiste Zlatan Ibrahimovic, of an improvised collaboration with Oscar that led to him being bundled off the stage. One of Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s independent dancers was quick to respond to the criticism, albeit with nothing more coherent than a bit of whataboutery. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce they\xe2\x80\x99re charging the ref, the only thing we can do is respond,\xe2\x80\x9d argued Plain Old John Terry, although in fairness he added that \xe2\x80\x9cit doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look great\xe2\x80\x9d, tapping into hitherto latent aesthetic sensitivities.</p> <p>Terry then admitted that Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s latest artistic misfire casts some of the collective\xe2\x80\x99s other projects in a new light. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s got to be forgotten. The Premier League is all we have got to go for now, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a massive one for us. Southampton will come here playing on the front foot and, if we\xe2\x80\x99re not at it, we\xe2\x80\x99ll drop points and slip away in the Premier League.\xe2\x80\x9d Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s domestic performances, as opposed to those on the European circuit, have on the whole been much more assured. But if last night\xe2\x80\x99s showing was anything to go by, they\xe2\x80\x99re becoming increasingly befuddled with over-elaborate concepts of negativity. If they don\xe2\x80\x99t want the Premier League to go the way of Europe, it might be time for Mourinho to take a leaf out of Wayne Coyne\xe2\x80\x99s book and come up with something a little less complicated in order to please the masses.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Paul Doyle from 6pm GMT for MBM coverage of Wolfsburg 2-1 Inter in Big Vase, before Scott Murray takes the wheel for Everton 1-1 Dynamo Kiev.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a freak accident at a time when we could have done without it due to our lack of available strikers\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Sam Allardyce confirms Enner Valencia is facing a spell on the sidelines with toe-rip after cutting it when stepping on a teacup he\xe2\x80\x99d dropped and broken [cup-tied?
