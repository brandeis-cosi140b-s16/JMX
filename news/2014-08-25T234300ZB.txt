b'Brendan Rodgers hails \xc2\xa316m Mario Balotelli as a \xe2\x80\x98calculated risk\xe2\x80\x99'


b'<p>Brendan Rodgers conceded he had taken a calculated risk on signing Mario Balotelli but claimed there was no better place than Liverpool for the Italian striker to curb his self-confessed flaws.</p> <p>Balotelli was present at the Etihad Stadium as his new club suffered a 3-1 defeat at his former employers and reigning Premier League champions, Manchester City. The 24-year-old had earlier completed his \xc2\xa316m move from Milan and signed a three-year contract at Liverpool, subject to registration, with Rodgers admitting the striker was a gamble worth taking at that price.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think to get someone of that quality in this market is a very good deal for us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rodgers, who bemoaned his team\xe2\x80\x99s defending at City. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a world-class talent and it is an area we need to strengthen. It is a calculated risk but one where we believe we can help him as a player and to mature as a young man.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have any concerns at all [about Balotelli disrupting the Liverpool squad]. It won\xe2\x80\x99t be affected. He comes with a reputation but we hope at our club we can curb that behaviour. He knows he is part of a team. There are no egos or big-time Charlies in our squad. This is a group that\xe2\x80\x99s got to the Champions League because they are a team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Liverpool manager may be close to Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho but admitted he had not asked the Chelsea manager for his thoughts on a player he once labelled \xe2\x80\x9cunmanageable\xe2\x80\x9d following their time together at Internazionale. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t because if you speak to too many people you get all sorts of stories,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been very impressed by the man himself because he is very honest. He knows his flaws and his faults and he is looking for someone to help him with it. Of course it is a risk, we are not going to say it isn\xe2\x80\x99t, but he is a big talent.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m certainly looking forward to playing with him. One thing he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lack is confidence. He has that belief and football arrogance and the best teams have that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Balotelli claimed he made a mistake in returning to Italy from Manchester City in January 2013 and that his experience would help the young players in Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 team. The 24-year-old will earn a basic \xc2\xa380,000 a week with an extra \xc2\xa340,000 based on the clauses and Liverpool also have the option to extend the contract into a fourth season.</p> <p>The Italy international met Rodgers at Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Melwood training ground on Friday and returned to Italy having completed his medical on Saturday.</p> <p>Upon his return from Milan to sign the deal, Balotelli met his new team-mates in the dressing room at the Etihad, watched the game from the stands with Adam Lallana, another new Liverpool signing, and returned to Merseyside on the first-team coach after the game.</p> <p>Balotelli, who will wear the No45 shirt at Liverpool, trained at Melwood on Monday and is in line to make his debut at Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. Despite fulfilling a boyhood wish to play for Milan when he returned to Italy, the striker admitted he erred in taking his career back to Serie A, having had a controversial spell at Internazionale before City recruited him for \xc2\xa317.5m in August 2010.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m happy to be back because I left England and it was a mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to go to Italy but I realised it was a mistake. English football is generally better. English football is beautiful.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Balotelli has been a disruption for most managers in his eventful career but believes he can be a positive influence on the young players at Liverpool. He added: \xe2\x80\x9cLiverpool are one of the best teams here in England.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe football is very good here. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great team with young players, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I came here. I maybe have a little bit more experience than other players \xe2\x80\x93 if I can help them, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to help them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
