b'What happened next to the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s 10 youngest players? | Nick Ames'


b'1) Matthew Briggs \xe2\x80\x93 16 years, 68 days <p>Middlesbrough 3-1 Fulham, 13 May 2007</p>  <p> Related: Millwall\xe2\x80\x99s Matthew Briggs rediscovers his roots with Guyana success </p>   <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHaving that record [as the youngest Premier League player] brings high expectations and things haven\xe2\x80\x99t quite worked out the way I wanted to since then,\xe2\x80\x9d says Briggs, an athletic and technically accomplished full-back whose career at Fulham never quite came to the boil despite promising signs in seven years around the first-team set-up. \xe2\x80\x9cLast year, in particular, the injury I had that kept me out all season killed me a bit. Fulham offered me a three-year contract but because I was injured I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to sign it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Briggs, who recently turned 24, was watched keenly by the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s top clubs early on but endured some chastening experiences \xe2\x80\x93 notably being replaced after 28 minutes of a game at Arsenal \xe2\x80\x93 and now finds himself on loan from Millwall to Colchester United in League One.</p> <p>He has made 25 first-team appearances this season, his best return yet, and accepts he has had to move backwards to prove himself on a consistent basis. \xe2\x80\x9cI did play quite a few games for Fulham but always said I\xe2\x80\x99m not experienced enough, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad thing to drop down and work your way back up. I\xe2\x80\x99m using this season to get as many games as I can, get back in the shop window and push on from there.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Briggs represented England at every level up to Under-21 but has now committed to Guyana \xe2\x80\x93 for whom he is eligible through his mother\xe2\x80\x99s side of the family. It is a significant change of situation for a player who is not too old to return to the top but probably feels he could do with a favourable break.</p>     Arsenal were not always Briggs\xe2\x80\x99 favourite opponents.

It was therefore little surprise when Chelsea came knocking a few weeks later, although West Brom might have held a little hope that they could keep a player they had developed.</p> <p>Subsequent events would make Brown (whose first name is short for Isaiah) a poster boy for the EPPP generation. The process set in train when one of the Champions League regulars starts sniffing around a rival\xe2\x80\x99s young prospect is an inexorable one nowadays \xe2\x80\x93 with players able to move between academies for relatively small compensation fees and few obvious safeguards in place to prevent them from jumping ship. Brown signed for Chelsea in July 2013, initially on an academy scholarship, and West Brom \xe2\x80\x93 who had lost Jerome Sinclair to Liverpool in similar fashion two years previously \xe2\x80\x93 were left wondering whether aiming for a top-class academy was worth it.</p> <p>Brown, who turned 18 in January, is yet to play for Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s senior team but there is enough to suggest that he will not follow the path of young English players who have fallen by the wayside after big early moves. He has produced some sparkling performances at junior levels and made it on to the first-team bench for last autumn\xe2\x80\x99s League Cup tie with Shrewsbury and, more tellingly, the draw with Manchester City in January. A loan to a club at a similar level to, say, West Brom looks likely next season and \xe2\x80\x93 whatever one thinks of the system that has brought him here \xe2\x80\x93 it seems certain that we will see far more of Brown.</p> 3) Aaron Lennon \xe2\x80\x93 16 years, 128 days <p>Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 Leeds United, 23 August 2003</p>     Lennon\xe2\x80\x99s Leeds days seem a long time ago. Photograph: Dave Thompson/PA    <p>Nobody connected with Leeds United will remember 2003-04 with any fondness. Ills such as Peter Ridsdale\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa320-a-month marine hobby had not long since been uncovered and, despite the promising young winger Lennon\xe2\x80\x99s introduction to a goldfish bowl of his own at White Hart Lane, things were well on their way down a slippery slope.</p> <p>Lennon could not help Leeds in the last 12 minutes of a 2-1 defeat but they were beyond saving by then and, upon their relegation, there was little chance of his hanging around for long. He did spend a season in the Championship, providing some welcome bright spots in his 27 league appearances, but Leeds\xe2\x80\x99 fire sale was well underway and he returned to Tottenham \xe2\x80\x93 this time as their employee \xe2\x80\x93 in June 2005. He cost just \xc2\xa31m.</p> <p>A year later he was representing England at the World Cup, performing superbly for Sven-Goran Eriksson\xe2\x80\x99s 10 men in the quarter-final with Portugal. Not everybody has appreciated Lennon\xe2\x80\x99s gifts and there have been persistent doubts about his end product \xe2\x80\x93 his goalscoring ratio has never picked up \xe2\x80\x93 but in full flow this orthodox winger can be unstoppable. And therein might lie the problem for a player, still only 27, who has not found favour with Mauricio Pochettino this season and finds himself helping Everton out of a spot of bother lower down the league. Lennon should be at his peak around now but you wonder what awaits for a player whose coruscating bursts of speed will only get rarer.</p> 4) Rushian Hepburn-Murphy \xe2\x80\x93 16 years, 176 days <p>Sunderland 0-4 Aston Villa, 14 March 2015</p> <p>Aston Villa have had few occasions to stretch out and experiment this season but the second half of their win against a woeful Sunderland was as convenient a time as things could possibly get. Tim Sherwood does not generally stop short of reminding people about his youth development record and, to give him his due, it generally holds up to scrutiny. In playing the final seven minutes at the Stadium of Light, Hepburn-Murphy was the first Villa youngster to be blooded by their new manager and with good reason.</p> <p>So young that he does not yet have a full profile on the Villa website, Hepburn-Murphy is a fast, direct forward with an eye for goal that had brought him 18 from 21 games for the club\xe2\x80\x99s youth sides by the time of his first-team bow. Family friend Daniel Sturridge reacted quickly to his debut with a congratulatory tweet and there are already parallels in the variety of finish that the two are capable of. He should receive further opportunities under Sherwood, who half-joked \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be expensive now if anyone wants to try and take him off us\xe2\x80\x9d after the Sunderland game.</p> 5) Jose Baxter \xe2\x80\x93 16 years, 191 days <p>Everton 2-3 Blackburn Rovers, 16 August 2008</p>     Jose Baxter took the brave decision to leave Everton behind. Photograph: Christopher Lee/Getty Images    <p>Baxter\xe2\x80\x99s decision to leave Everton in 2012 and drop down the leagues to play regular football appears to have borne fruit and it will surely not be long before he is, at least, performing at Championship level.</p> <p>The playmaker was given his debut by David Moyes, playing the final 12 minutes against Blackburn on the first day of the 2008-09 season, but made only 13 more appearances over the coming three years and \xe2\x80\x93 despite being offered a new contract at Goodison Park \xe2\x80\x93 decided that the comfort zone of Under-21 football was not for him.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI played reserve football from 14 up to 19 and it just got boring. If a first-team player was injured he would come down and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take it seriously. It just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said later.</p> <p>This was true to the extent that he walked away from the club where he had spent most of his life, eventually signing for the League One side Oldham Athletic in September 2012 and, 17 goals later, joining Sheffield United. He has scored 13 times this season and also found the net at Wembley last season in the FA Cup semi-final against Hull. Nigel Clough\xe2\x80\x99s side are nailed on for this season\xe2\x80\x99s play-offs and you sense that Baxter, who turned 23 in February, is not too far from completing the turnaround that he instigated himself.</p> 6) Gary McSheffrey \xe2\x80\x93 16 years, 198 days <p>Aston Villa 1-4 Coventry, 27 February 1999</p> <p>McSheffrey\xe2\x80\x99s debut was a footnote to Coventry\xe2\x80\x99s first league win at Villa Park but it was an early nod to a talent that had been developing at a rapid pace in the club\xe2\x80\x99s youth team. He starred in successive runs to the final in 1999 and 2000, and by the time of the latter he had added three more top-flight appearances to his tally.</p> <p>A fleet-footed winger with the technical ability to work as a playmaker too, he became a formidable force in the Championship after City\xe2\x80\x99s relegation in 2001 and joined Birmingham City \xe2\x80\x93 of the same division \xe2\x80\x93 for \xc2\xa34m in 2006. This still felt anticlimactic for a player of whom much had been expected but 13 goals in 2006-07 helped ensure him another shot at the Premier League with Birmingham, for whom he would feature regularly the following season before relegation and a nagging knee injury stalled him once more.</p> <p>There were another handful of Premier League appearances for McSheffrey when Birmingham, yo-yoing at they did in the 2000s, returned for 2009-10 but the old explosiveness had gone and he would return to Coventry at the end of the season. Three years back where it all began were spent to relatively little effect, the Sky Blues dropping to League One in 2011-12 and McSheffrey being released by Steven Pressley a year later. Last season was largely spent with Chesterfield and Scunthorpe; he is enjoying something of an Indian summer with the latter this term, with eight goals and 44 appearances so far for Coventry\xe2\x80\x99s divisional rivals, but there is a feeling of nearly-but-not-quite when you assess his career as a whole.</p> 7) Jack Robinson \xe2\x80\x93 16 years, 250 days <p>Hull City 0-0 Liverpool, 9 May, 2010</p>     Jack Robinson tackles Andrey Arshavin at the Emirates. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian    <p>If Jack Robinson was a parting gift from Rafa Ben\xc3\xadtez to Liverpool, he was one the club never showed much inclination to make use of. Given three minutes in the Spaniard\xe2\x80\x99s final game in charge, Robinson was an able, all-round left-back with a strong presence on the ball and enough promise to suggest things were not all bad at the end of a turgid campaign.</p> <p>His ability has been evident since but generally elsewhere, a few more tasters under Ben\xc3\xadtez\xe2\x80\x99s successors dwarved in importance by loan spells in the Championship with Wolves and Blackpool. Those were enough to tempt QPR to bid for Robinson, by this time nowhere in Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 first-team plans, last summer but any possibility of prolonged Premier League exposure is now painfully on hold. Sent on loan to Huddersfield for the season straight after signing, Robinson impressed under Chris Powell \xe2\x80\x93 who should know a good left-back when he sees one \xe2\x80\x93 but suffered a serious knee injury against Birmingham in March and now seems likely to miss the best part of a year. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been great for us this season,\xe2\x80\x9d said Powell, and the consolation for Robinson, who has 10 England Under-21 caps, will be that he has shown enough to suggest that there is a future for him in the Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 whether or not that is with his parent club.</p> 8) Jack Wilshere \xe2\x80\x93 16 years, 255 days <p>Blackburn Rovers 0-4 Arsenal, 13 September 2008</p> <p>Wilshere had been talked about in hushed tones in Arsenal circles for a couple of years before this brief appearance as a substitute for Robin van Persie. When he performed masterfully against Sheffield United in the League Cup 10 days later, scoring a fine goal to boot, there was substance to go with the rumours of lavish style and he racked up a number of age-related records for his club over the coming months.</p> <p>The concern now is that Wilshere, who is soon to return from the latest in a string of injury setbacks that has precluded him from building up much serious momentum in recent years, has not pushed on to become the consistently irresistible force for club and country that he had promised to be. There have been dominant performances against Xavi and Andr\xc3\xa9s Iniesta and flourishes of the kind that won him the \xe2\x80\x98goal of the season\xe2\x80\x99 award last year, but there remain doubts about the best position of a player who scored plenty in his youth but has been preferred by Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger as a tempo-setting force from deep. You also wonder whether Arsenal, currently looking their most convincing in several years, can comfortably accommodate him in their current setup. Wilshere is the most perceptive footballer to emerge from an English academy in many a year but, now 23, he is about to enter a period that may decide whether he can really have his shot at greatness.</p> 9) Mark Platts \xe2\x80\x93 16 years, 264 days <p>Sheffield Wednesday 2-1 Wimbledon, 10 February 1996</p> <p>Platts\xe2\x80\x99 career was comfortably the briefest and lowest-key of the players on this list, who have generally gone on to perform at respectable levels. Chris Waddle was 35 by the time he left Sheffield Wednesday and Platts, a winger well under half his age, replaced him for the final few minutes of a routine win against Wimbledon.</p> <p>Hyped at the time and a hit at England schoolboy level, the left-footer was linked with bigger clubs but Platts \xe2\x80\x93 an undoubted talent who those in the know suggest was fast-tracked too soon \xe2\x80\x93 appeared only once more for Wednesday and failed to play in the first team after signing a professional contract in October 1996. By March 1999 he had joined Torquay United, playing 39 times before being released when he became homesick for Sheffield. He rejoined Waddle, who had been one of his biggest advocates when coming through but now seemed to be tasked with resurrecting his career, at Worksop Town for a time but dropped out of the game and is not believed to have kicked a football in earnest in many a year \xe2\x80\x93 instead working in the steel construction industry. In a twist of fate his younger cousin, Jordan Chapell, now plays for Torquay \xe2\x80\x93 albeit he is currently on loan with Grimsby.</p> 10) James Vaughan \xe2\x80\x93 16 years, 270 days <p>Everton 4-0 Crystal Palace, 10 April 2005</p>     James Vaughan\xe2\x80\x99s foot injury \xe2\x80\x93 seen here \xe2\x80\x93 was one of a string of misfortunes he suffered at Everton. Photograph: Jon Super/AP    <p>Vaughan was the first Everton player to hold the record that Baxter broke three-and-a-half years later and has similarly had to build his career lower down. His hand was forced by injuries; it had seemed for a time that Vaughan would prove himself instantly as a Premier League force and never more so than on his debut, against Crystal Palace, when he scored three minutes from time. Tall, quick and powerful, Vaughan seemed certain to be a quick achiever and did go on to play 60 games for Everton, scoring nine times.</p> <p>By the time he left, in 2011, he had suffered from a serious knee problem and endured the horror of a severed artery in a match against Bolton. Things never quite got going and, although they picked up again with then-Championship side Crystal Palace, a big-money move to Norwich did not work out \xe2\x80\x93 injuries again intervening \xe2\x80\x93 and it would be at Huddersfield, for whom he signed in 2013 after a successful season on loan, that he found the playing time, fitness and consistency that he had sought for almost a decade.</p> <p>Vaughan, who has captained the Terriers, spent three months of this season on the sidelines too but 33 goals in 89 appearances for a generally struggling team has been a decent return and it is certainly possible to envisage him turning out for a promotion challenger. Whether, at 26, he has the potential to try again in the Premier League is a moot point.</p>'
