b'Arjen Robben: \xe2\x80\x98You can discuss anything with Pep. At 3am he\xe2\x80\x99s happy to talk\xe2\x80\x99'


b'<p>Arjen Robben suddenly drops his defensive, cross-armed pose. He has just begun to consider the imposing list of managers for whom he has played \xe2\x80\x93 Guus Hiddink, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho, Louis van Gaal, Jupp Heynckes and Pep Guardiola \xe2\x80\x93 when the change comes. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery manager has a certain influence,\xe2\x80\x9d Robben says, \xe2\x80\x9cand it depends whether you\xe2\x80\x99re 18, 25 or 30. You need different things. But, in general, one thing matters most.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>At this point, thinking hard, Robben uncrosses his arms, nods intently and leans forward as he really begins to talk. \xe2\x80\x9cYou need to be very critical of yourself. There are a few very good managers who can make players better individually. Most managers think about the team process \xe2\x80\x93 and so you have to improve things on your own. You have to be very strong mentally. But it\xe2\x80\x99s also very important to be critical of yourself. This is something I miss a little with the younger generation.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThese days you have guys who are 19 or 20 and they\xe2\x80\x99ve played their first game and they feel they\xe2\x80\x99ve made it. It\xe2\x80\x99s not true. There\xe2\x80\x99s always so much to improve, no matter your age. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m really enjoying working with Pep. I learn from him every day and that\xe2\x80\x99s a special feeling. People always say young players can learn a lot and even at 26, 27 you can still make big steps. Then, it\xe2\x80\x99s expected you stay at that level or go down.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Robben, who turned 31 last month, rubs his bald head ruefully in a small room on a sunlit yet freezing February afternoon in Munich. A friendly but guarded atmosphere with one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s greatest and most controversial footballers has become far more interesting. It is now also easier to understand why Robben has reached new heights as a player in recent years.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I started working with Pep 18 months ago I noticed how he goes much deeper into football,\xe2\x80\x9d Robben says. \xe2\x80\x9cHis intelligence is obvious. Tactically he\xe2\x80\x99s one of the best in the world and under him I have made more steps in my development. I\xe2\x80\x99ve come quite a long way these 18 months.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Guardiola has been criticised, and some argue that Bayern have regressed from Heynckes\xe2\x80\x99s treble-winning team of 2013. Robben, however, makes the salient point that Heynckes\xe2\x80\x99s triumph was forged in the misery of 2012. Playing in the Champions League final at home, at the Allianz Arena, Bayern lost on penalties to Chelsea. It was the most painful night of Robben\xe2\x80\x99s career as the soured expectation of a Bayern victory was made even more bitter by him missing a penalty against his former club in extra time.</p> <p>A few days later, just before Euro 2012, Robben played in a friendly for Holland against Bayern and he was booed relentlessly by his club supporters. \xe2\x80\x9cThe best thing about football,\xe2\x80\x9d Robben says now, \xe2\x80\x9cand sport in general, is that if you suffer a big disappointment then there is no better feeling than coming back the following year and doing well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Bayern secured the next Bundesliga title with the widest-ever winning margin \xe2\x80\x93 Borussia Dortmund finished 25 points adrift. They also won the cup and the Champions League. In the semi-final they thrashed Barcelona 7-0 on aggregate while, in the final at Wembley against Dortmund, Robben set up the equaliser and scored the winner.</p>  <p> Related: Bayern Munich 8-0 Hamburg | Bundesliga match report </p>   <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAt the start of that season I was so motivated,\xe2\x80\x9d Robben remembers. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not only me but everybody in the squad. It sounds like a cliche but you felt this determination to make up for everything. Nobody enjoyed the holiday before that \xe2\x80\x93 we were just waiting for the first day of training so we could come back stronger. We pushed ourselves so hard in every session. Our reaction was very special.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Robben hit a peak of form and fitness that has remained at a staggering pitch for three consecutive seasons. At last summer\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup, as he inspired Holland to a 5-1 demolition of the defending champions, Spain, scoring two goals, Robben grew in stature the longer the tournament progressed. Far more than Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, he lit up the World Cup, while courting familiar acrimony.</p> <p>Once a surly and brittle presence, Robben rose up in Brazil. Elevated to the vice-captaincy by Van Gaal, a sweat-drenched Robben urged on his side, encouraging and cajoling his team-mates. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was my role. We had a lot of young players and that\xe2\x80\x99s a responsibility you have to take. I really enjoyed it. Against Spain we were sure of a very tough game and when you go 1-0 down it\xe2\x80\x99s more difficult. I think the 1-1 goal [Robin van Persie\xe2\x80\x99s unforgettable header] was beautiful and crucial. But the second half was amazing. It was almost hard to believe we could play so well against world champions, because the expectations for us were not that high. Personally I had a lot of good reactions.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>There was also vitriol after the last-16 victory over Mexico when Robben was castigated by the opposition manager, Miguel Herrera, for \xe2\x80\x9cthree dives\xe2\x80\x9d in a match that the Dutch won with a late penalty. Robben had gone down again, more legitimately, but his previous theatrics could not be ignored. He conceded that he had dived earlier and apologised but insisted the penalty resulted from a clear foul.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m glad I said it,\xe2\x80\x9d Robben confirms, remembering his admission of a dive. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was lots of controversy and everyone was speaking about it. I was honest and I got punished. There was some negative publicity but I\xe2\x80\x99m still 100% sure I did the right thing in talking openly. There was one mistake I made in the game against Mexico \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Robben laughs awkwardly. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought someone was about to kick me and, in the end, he pulled his leg backwards just as I started going down. But it had absolutely no influence on the game. It was not a claim for a penalty. It\xe2\x80\x99s behind me now \xe2\x80\xa6 well, maybe not in Mexico [he smiles wryly]. I actually think lots of other players were doing worse things.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He gets kicked in every match, as do all skilful and dangerous players, and Robben argues that he sometimes goes down to avoid injury. After a quarter-final victory over Costa Rica, Robben said he was tired of \xe2\x80\x9cthe bullshit\xe2\x80\x9d. Now, he says, \xe2\x80\x9cI think the referee for Costa Rica had a perfect game because sometimes I felt like a wild deer in the woods. They were kicking me at every opportunity and he protected me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Robben\xe2\x80\x99s sustained excellence is a more intriguing phenomenon. At Chelsea, from 2004 to 2007, his performances were interrupted by frequent injury. A decade later he looks stronger, fitter, faster and a much harder and far superior player. Robben today is a twinkle-toed beast rather than a stricken waif.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere is an easy explanation,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI started working with an osteopath in my last year at Real Madrid [in 2009] and I continued when I came here. We have a great medical team and with the special training we do, the extra work I put in, it\xe2\x80\x99s getting control over your body. You know when you are in the danger zone as you get a better understanding of your body. Now, touch wood, it\xe2\x80\x99s going really well.</p>  <p> Related: Bayer Leverkusen 4-5 Wolfsburg | Bundesliga match report </p>   <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI feel really good. I have lots of energy but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen like magic. I put in many extra hours in the gym and with the physios. You feel strong on the pitch. You have this feeling of power, that you can show the best of your football. This season has been the same and it\xe2\x80\x99s surprising. A lot of players here went to the World Cup final \xe2\x80\x93 and I made it to the third-place game. Everyone expected us to have difficulties but it\xe2\x80\x99s not turned out that way.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Two weeks ago Bayern lost for the first time in the Bundesliga this season when, returning from the winter break, they were beaten 4-1 at Wolfsburg. At the start of February I watched them at the Allianz Arena when, reduced to 10 men, they were held 1-1 by Schalke, after a headed goal by Robben. The Dutch winger was full of zest and verve and, a few days later, he scored a sumptuous volley as Bayern beat Stuttgart 2-0.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe team deserves a big compliment,\xe2\x80\x9d Robben says as Bayern prepare for Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s first leg of the Champions League last 16, away to Shakhtar Donetsk, with the war in Ukraine forcing the match to be held in Lviv. \xe2\x80\x9cWe drew three of our [Bundesliga] games before the winter break and won the rest. It\xe2\x80\x99s now a case of getting into the rhythm again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>On Saturday Bayern regained their imperious rhythm as Robben scored another two goals in a 8-0 victory over Hamburg, to remain eight points clear of second-placed Wolfsburg.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAgainst Wolfsburg we made mistakes and they killed us on the counterattack. With 11 players against Schalke we would have won and I was annoyed with the goal we conceded. When you\xe2\x80\x99re one man down it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen that their strongest guy in the air [Benedikt H\xc3\xb6wedes] is allowed to go free and score the perfect header.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy. Everyone was saying before Christmas: \xe2\x80\x98Oh, the Bundesliga is boring because Bayern is dominating.\xe2\x80\x99 But against Wolfsburg and Schalke you can see you don\xe2\x80\x99t get any presents in this league. It\xe2\x80\x99s even more so with the Champions League. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like people talking about the quarter-finals or semis or saying: \xe2\x80\x98When will you meet Madrid or Bar\xc3\xa7a?\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s Shakhtar and nothing more. Pep will give us so much detail on Shakhtar. He already told us that in his Barcelona days he played them four or five times. So he has said: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m well prepared.\xe2\x80\x99 Before each big game his preparation is incredible.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The admiration is mutual, for Guardiola has declared: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in love with Arjen Robben \xe2\x80\xa6 he has an unbelievable mentality.\xe2\x80\x9d The Dutch winger almost blushes. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a very good relationship. I like the way he thinks about football and his tactical flexibility means we\xe2\x80\x99ve played a few systems. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like we are a 4-4-2 team. We use all kinds of formations with Pep and this means I can play inside or outside, just behind the strikers or even as a striker. That\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic because the way he wants to play, with a very dominant style, suits me perfectly. And you can discuss anything with him. If it\xe2\x80\x99s 3am Pep would be happy to talk to you about football.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAfter Wolfsburg you could see on his face how much it hurt him. He hates losing. But every great manager hates losing. If Mourinho loses 4-1 \xe2\x80\xa6 hmmmphhh \xe2\x80\xa6 he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep well. They are winners. They\xe2\x80\x99re so strong and that\xe2\x80\x99s why they are so successful.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Robben\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Mourinho at Chelsea was different. \xe2\x80\x9cFor me it was very good to work with him at that age because I was young and, yeah, with Mourinho, you have to be mentally very strong. You have to jump on the train with him or \xe2\x80\xa6 you\xe2\x80\x99re off. So it was great for my development.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was hard at first because I came with an injury. It was very difficult for me and also for him. Of course, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like players who get injured. So it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t easy but I always had the feeling I had his confidence. I played some great games for Chelsea but it was unfortunate I had injury problems and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it over a long period \xe2\x80\x93 like now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Gaal, meanwhile, would love to entice him to Old Trafford. Robben points out that he is contracted to Bayern until 2017 but he underlines his debt to Van Gaal. \xe2\x80\x9cThe best and most important step of my career was when I moved here \xe2\x80\x93 and Louis van Gaal brought me from Madrid to Bayern. It was the best move of my career and it\xe2\x80\x99s thanks to him. In the first year we reached the Champions League final [in 2010], which was a big surprise, and won the double in Germany. Van Gaal made me an important member of the team and fortunately I delivered.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As Robben relaxes his conversation is very different to the snarling, diving stereotype that sometimes obscures a wonderful footballer. He shakes his head fondly as he remembers Christmas football in England. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say I miss it, but it also had its charms. The real charm was the family coming over for Christmas \xe2\x80\x93 and watching me play at home on Boxing Day. But playing four games in 10 days is crazy. A break in the middle of the season is good for everybody.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Robben talks animatedly about his home club, Groningen, in the Netherlands, and his part in a campaign to promote a love of books. He is married to his teenage sweetheart, Bernadien, and they have three children. It all sounds very sweet and Robben smiles. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a family man. I want to spend time with them. They followed me around Europe and always supported me. So when I stop playing it\xe2\x80\x99s family at No1. I\xe2\x80\x99m interested in all I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned but at the moment I don\xe2\x80\x99t have this big ambition to become a manager. But sometimes you feel that after all the experiences, and the privilege of working with these great coaches, you must share this knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>His fierce desire and ferocious commitment still burns. Robben clearly anticipates more Champions League glory with Bayern Munich and another World Cup in 2018. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not? It\xe2\x80\x99s good because I can be relaxed. You can be too intense and think: \xe2\x80\x98I want this or that \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99 But I\xe2\x80\x99ve done a lot already and as long as I\xe2\x80\x99m enjoying it and I\xe2\x80\x99m really fit I will continue \xe2\x80\x93 and, hopefully, keep improving.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
