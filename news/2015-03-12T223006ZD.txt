b'David Luiz: from Brazilian clown to PSG\xe2\x80\x99s super hero in eight months | Julien Laurens'


b'<p>The jokes, the sarcasm and the inevitable social media parodies were coming from right, left and centre. It was almost too easy. Paris Saint-Germain signed David Luiz for \xc2\xa350m last June and for weeks the French club became the laughing stock of world football.</p> <p>Chelsea, renowned themselves for overpaying for the services of Fernando Torres, had hoodwinked the club of the French capital to part with a fortune for a good but mistake-prone and unreliable player. Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho did not want him any more so he must have been rubbish.</p> <p>The infamous World Cup semi-final against Germany reinforced the belief that the Parisians had been ripped off and the jokes resurfaced. It was an abysmal low for David Luiz and for Brazil but on Wednesday in the Champions League at Stamford Bridge, his road to redemption came to an end. No one dared to scoff at his price tag or mock PSG\xe2\x80\x99s folly for signing him. He proudly led his club to one of their biggest wins ever. The French newspaper L\xe2\x80\x99Equipe gave him a nine out of 10 in their ratings, which is unheard of for a defender.</p> <p>On Wednesday night, during the Chelsea players\xe2\x80\x99 shenanigans that followed Zlatan Ibrahimovic\xe2\x80\x99s red card, David Luiz, still only 27, approached the touchline for a drink. He stood in front of the Chelsea bench. His determination and anger were palpable. Mourinho was in close proximity and the Brazilian roared in English: \xe2\x80\x9cLook now. With 10 men.\xe2\x80\x9d He repeated it for clarity and pointed his two index fingers towards the ground with a resolute expression which could only be translated as: \xe2\x80\x9cWe will beat you here, on this pitch with just 10 men.\xe2\x80\x9d At times, he seemed possessed. It looked like he knew then that he would be the hero.</p> <p>His head to head with Diego Costa can only be described as epic. The pair had twice played together for Brazil back in March 2013 against Italy and Russia. They played against each other last season in the semi-finals of the Champions League (although David Luiz was in midfield) and he knew exactly what to expect from the former Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid man who now plays for Spain. Elbows were exchanged but he never gave up. He stood tall in front of his opponent, who hardly had a sniff at goal.</p> <p>Instead, it was David Luiz who scored the goal of hope towards the end of the 90 minutes. He may not be tactically infallible, he may make mistakes, he may be too nonchalant at times and drift in and out of games but what you cannot question is his resilience. The Brazilian is made of steel. You can try to unsettle him but you will not win that battle.</p> <p>This season, David Luiz is a man for big occasions. He thrives when the intensity is at its peak, when the pressure is enormous, and when he can lead by example. His three stand-out games have been the win against Barcelona in Paris (3-2) in the group stages where he also found the back of the net and the two matches against Chelsea.</p> <p>That said, he has had some bad games too where he simply could not be bothered to turn up. At Toulouse, back in September, it was one of the worst displays from a centre-back anywhere in the world. He was all over the place. Perhaps the occasion just was not big enough for him.</p> <p>However, after only a few weeks at PSG, a member of Laurent Blanc\xe2\x80\x99s staff, impressed by the positive attitude radiated by David Luiz, commented: \xe2\x80\x9cIf we had had him in our team last season, we would have beaten Chelsea.\xe2\x80\x9d He was right. With David Luiz in the team, PSG were the victors this time around.</p> <p>David Luiz is a likeable guy. In his interview after the game he apologised to Chelsea fans for his goal celebration: \xe2\x80\x9cI said I would not celebrate if I scored but I am sorry, I could not control my emotions. Chelsea have always respected me and I respect them a lot but I am sorry, I could not control myself.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It is almost impossible not to like him. His words for Blanc after the game were sincere. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is an amazing coach, an amazing person. He is human and it is very important for us to play for someone like him,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>David Luiz owes a lot to Blanc. When financial fair play sanctions hit Paris last season and the club was permitted just one major transfer, the manager made the defender his target. He could have tried to secure the attacking services of Eden Hazard, Paul Pogba or \xc3\x81ngel Di Mar\xc3\xada but he wanted only David Luiz.</p> <p>The two men have built a close relationship and the hug they shared after the final whistle on Wednesday was significant. David Luiz may have hogged the headlines for his goal but the win belongs to Blanc too. Outsmarted by Mourinho last season, he came out on top this time.</p> <p>Blanc needed a win like this prove his credentials. PSG needed a win to enter the realms of greatness in Europe. Now they can dream bigger. They have knocked out the Premier League leaders and one of the favourites of the competition with one of the west London club\xe2\x80\x99s former players instrumental. It does not get much better than that, especially for a player who was the butt of all those jokes a short time ago.</p>'
