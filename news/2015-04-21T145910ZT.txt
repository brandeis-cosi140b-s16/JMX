b'<p>A 1.69% CHANCE AND SOME PEP TALK </p> <p>Bang on course to steer his side to a consecutive Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal double, it\xe2\x80\x99s small wonder Pep Guardiola has recently been the subject of speculation regarding his future after yet another season of abject failure in charge of Bayern Munich. With that double the bare minimum required of any Bayern manager worth the salz on their Th\xc3\xbcringer Rostbratwurst, Pep has found himself under fire since his side lost 3-1 in the opening leg of their Big Cup quarter-final against Porto. Should they fail to overcome this deficit in the Allianz Arena tonight, it will make it two seasons from two in which the mighty German behemoth has failed to even make the final. \xe2\x80\x9cI know which club I am at, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to win the Bundesliga and the Cup,\xe2\x80\x9d parped Pep. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly a treble is enough, but I am proud to be here with these players.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Considering some of the shellackings they\xe2\x80\x99ve dished out to various teams in recent seasons, Bayern\xe2\x80\x99s exit from the tournament tonight is by no means a foregone conclusion, but history is against them. Bespectacled eggheads wearing white coats in the Fiver Towers laboratory have squinted at bubbling test tubes, scratched complex mathematical formulae on a blackboard and revealed that, since away goals were made, the tie-breaker in the case of a draw in Big Cup and Vase, just 1.69% of teams (three out of 178) attempting to overturn a 3-1 defeat away from home in the first leg have managed to do so. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, the same scientists have discovered that Bayern have never managed it in four attempts, but have promised to continue working on finding a way to turn lead into gold, which is what they\xe2\x80\x99re actually supposed to be doing with their pipettes and bunsen burners.</p> <p>If nothing else, Pep can take heart from the fact that both of Porto\xe2\x80\x99s first-choice full-backs Alex Sandro and Danilo will be forced to watch this evening\xe2\x80\x99s game from Uefa\xe2\x80\x99s naughty step, a state of affairs that would almost certainly be more beneficial if Bayern wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery weren\xe2\x80\x99t knacked and major doubts. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to make some changes, but the way we approach the game will remain the same,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julen Lopetegui, helpfully stepping in to flesh out another paragraph. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are a team without any big surprises and quite predictable: when we have the ball we want to attack; when we don\xe2\x80\x99t have the ball we want to get it back. I don\xe2\x80\x99t waste energy and time thinking about what will Bayern do. We need to focus on ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Elsewhere in Munich, following the highly publicised departure of Bayern\xe2\x80\x99s club doctor last week, former Bayern and Germany midfielder-turned-pundit Stefan Effenberg has warned his former club not to cede too much control to their manager. A man so controversial he once appeared in public wearing red leather trousers, Effenberg said: \xe2\x80\x9cNow you have to watch out so that Guardiola doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get too much power and also decides who is going to make up the new medical staff. That could be dangerous for the future of Bayern.\xe2\x80\x9d Presumably ahead of tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game the club will have a temporary physician in position. </p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Scott Murray for MBM coverage of Bayern 2-1 Porto from 7.45pm BST, while Barry Glendenning will be on hand for Barcelona 1-1 PSG.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt has occurred on and off.
