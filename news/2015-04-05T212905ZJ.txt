b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho lauds Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my for striker\xe2\x80\x99s impact on title drive'


b'<p>Chelsea are approaching the time when magnanimity becomes that bit easier and there was plenty of it on display after a victory whose importance overrode its quality. Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho and Didier Drogba were among those at pains to seek out Charlie Adam, whose astonishing 66-yard equaliser felt like the apex of a lifetime\xe2\x80\x99s work, for congratulations and they could do so in the knowledge that a contribution from much closer in had again held off the prospect of a meaningful title race.</p> <p>Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my had attempted four shots inside the first 18 minutes, two of them expertly repelled by Asmir Begovic, but he had no need to duel with the Stoke goalkeeper shortly after the hour. Begovic, overenthusiastically heeding Mark Hughes\xe2\x80\x99s earlier entreaty that his side play from the back, rolled a straight, telegraphed ball towards Steven Nzonzi that was touched by Willian to Eden Hazard and eventually squared for R\xc3\xa9my, in front of an unguarded goal, to make his second decisive intervention in as many games after his late winner last time out at Hull.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe keeps himself in great condition, even without [having played] many minutes to be ready for us. He\xe2\x80\x99s a great boy and his contribution is already crucial, with these two match-winners in the last two matches,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho of R\xc3\xa9my, who was making only his fourth Premier League start for Chelsea. He should add to that number after Diego Costa\xe2\x80\x99s latest injury mishap that resulted in him limping off 11 minutes after entering as a half-time substitute.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEvery striker has this in them, so today when Eden recovered the ball you could see immediately he sprinted to score what I call an easy goal but I love strikers to score easy goals. The tap-in when the goalkeeper has an incomplete save, attacking the ball on a low cross, rebounds \xe2\x80\x93 I love the easy goals from a striker.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It was R\xc3\xa9my\xe2\x80\x99s final touch before being replaced by Juan Cuadrado and a finish that belied the toughness of a game in which Chelsea generally spluttered. A compact four-man Stoke midfield was difficult to play through and continually forced Chelsea to concede possession cheaply. They opened the scoring after their most sustained period of first-half pressure, the exceptional Hazard beating Begovic from the penalty spot after Philipp Wollscheid had fouled Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas, but the Spaniard and his midfield partner Nemanja Matic were otherwise subdued. That could be said for several other occasions of late but Mourinho has had no thoughts of altering his team\xe2\x80\x99s balance at this stage of the season.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFor me, football is not just mathematics,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen some people write that F\xc3\xa0bregas drops his level because the number of assists are not the same, the number of assists is probably not the same because the player that he assists doesn\xe2\x80\x99t score. I think he\xe2\x80\x99s playing wonderfully well.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI always think stability is very important in a team and it\xe2\x80\x99s not in April that you are going to make important changes. April is a moment of stability and obviously I keep faith in the people that I have trusted from the beginning of the season.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>There was less slack given to the out-of-form Oscar, who was replaced by Costa at the interval after an opening period in which he dragged a clear chance wide and struggled to make any impact in possession. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think he had a bad performance, I just think he was not good enough, which is a huge difference,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said.</p> <p>Stoke, who nearly equalised for a second time when Nzonzi clipped a post from 25 yards, are playing with little pressure bar the desire for self-improvement, although a first-half exchange between Hughes and his midfielder Glenn Whelan served notice of their intention to make gains here.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI felt we weren\xe2\x80\x99t looking to play out from the back \xe2\x80\x93 we were allowing Asmir to just kick the ball long and it kept on coming back to us,\xe2\x80\x9d Hughes said. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted us to get on the ball and control the game, and Glenn\xe2\x80\x99s a big part of that. Glenn\xe2\x80\x99s a senior player, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a problem. I used to give dog\xe2\x80\x99s abuse to my managers, it\xe2\x80\x99s an emotional game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Adam, at least, showed the bravery Hughes values and was aware of the sense of theatre that his bolt from the blue shortly before half-time would create. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have the pace to go in behind, so I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen an opening,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the goalkeeper off his line and I thought \xe2\x80\x98why not do it at a place like Chelsea?\xe2\x80\x99 It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter where it is, I\xe2\x80\x99ll try it. Today it came off.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Man of the match Eden Hazard (Chelsea)</p>'
