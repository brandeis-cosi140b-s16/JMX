b"<p>\xe2\x80\x9cWatching the successful Oscar-bait pic The Theory Of Everything,\xe2\x80\x9d writes James Tong last week, hopefully after having left the cinema. \xe2\x80\x9cI was surprised to see World Cup winning defender Frank Leboeuf make a short cameo. As the film received a Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards, could he be the first footballer to have been part of World Cup winning and Oscar winning teams? Have any other footballers been part of Oscar winning films?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Eddie Redmayne has received the bulk of the praise for his role as Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything but it\xe2\x80\x99s a shame that Leboeuf\xe2\x80\x99s role as \xe2\x80\x9cSwiss Doctor\xe2\x80\x9d has been so overshadowed. The former Chelsea defender even features in the trailer:</p>            <p>&quot;It\xe2\x80\x99s not random: it\xe2\x80\x99s something I\xe2\x80\x99ve wanted to do for a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the Radio Times last year. \xe2\x80\x9cIn 2000 I shot a movie, Taking Sides, while I was still playing for Chelsea. Then after I stopped playing football I did acting courses for two years in Los Angeles. I worked hard on that. I was practising 4-5 hours a day on stage or behind the camera to learn the process. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t like I assumed that because I was known people would take me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Leboeuf is hardly the first footballer to try his hand as a thespian, but in general the transition is not particularly successful. Daniel Bickermann gets in touch with a fascinating list of players turned players, including Franz Beckenbauer\xe2\x80\x99s dismal appearances in several 70s German comedies, Paul Breitner\xe2\x80\x99s apperance in the cult comedy B-western Potato Fritz and The Twitcher (the latter of which actually won several Prizes at the Berlin Film Festival in 1983), the Swedish national keeper Ronnie Hellstr\xc3\xb6m\xe2\x80\x99s role in the international children\xe2\x80\x99s classic Fimpen, and Roberto Boninsegna and Carlo Ancelotti\xe2\x80\x99s forgettable efforts in Terrence Hill\xe2\x80\x99s Don Camillo remake.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe only footballer (I could find) to star in an Oscar-winning movie is \xe2\x80\xa6 Eric Cantona, whose quite illustrious film career started with Elizabeth, which of course won an Oscar for best make-up (and was nominated for 6 more), a Golden Globe and no less than seven Baftas,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Daniel. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the more impressive, since that was his acting debut (forgetting two appearances as a footballer or rugby player), and his performance is actually more than a cameo but a bona fide speaking role. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a one-off either, with two of his subsequent films nomintated for C\xc3\xa9sars, another one winning the coveted Golden Leopard in Locarno and and one where he has the starring role (\xe2\x80\x9cLooking for Eric\xe2\x80\x9d) even nominated for a European Film Award and winning the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury in Cannes.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut he is neither an Oscar winner (that would mean winning for his performance) nor a World Cup winner \xe2\x80\x93 but so close! He was resigning from the national squad after an argument with the manager just before the 1998 world championship, which his team would go on to win without him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: All aboard the League Liner \xe2\x80\x93 football's disco train | The Knowledge </p>   <p>We have, though, managed to find one former player who was not simply part of an Oscar-winning film but was the man to receive the Oscar. Step forward the former Dundee United inside-left Neil Paterson. Born in Greenock in 1915 Paterson initially trained as a solicitor but turned out for Buckie Thistle on the side. That was followed by a stint with Leith Athletic before Dundee United came calling in 1936. Paterson captained the side for a period in 1936-37 and scored nine times in 26 appearances, but had no real interest in playing the game as a career and left at the end of the season to bag a job in journalism.</p> <p>Paterson joined the navy and survived the bombing of his ship, The Vanessa, during the second world war before turning his hand to writing novels. He turned one of his short stories, Scotch Settlement (the tale of two young boys stealing a baby when told that they could not have a dog), into a screenplay and the resulting film, The Kidnappers, brought Honorary Oscars for its two young leads, Jon Whiteley and Vincent Winter.</p> <p>Thereafter screenplays became Paterson\xe2\x80\x99s medium of choice. In 1959 Paterson wrote the screenplay for Room at the Top, a novel by John Braine. It picked up six Academy Award nominations and ended up winning two \xe2\x80\x93 Simone Signoret bagged the gong for best actress and Paterson himself picked up the best adapted screenplay award.</p> <p>For more on Paterson, see his 1995 obituary and this 2010 piece from the Daily Record.</p> GREAT THRASHING TURNAROUNDS (2) <p>Last week we looked at the sides who have gone from being thrashed to dishing out a thrashing in the space of two matches. Several readers have been in touch to point out a few others, but no one could quite match this effort from Dan Seppings:</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn response to your question \xe2\x80\x98are there any better goal turnarounds?\xe2\x80\x99, I can reveal via my awesomely dull database skills: \xe2\x80\x98yes there are and some\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Dan. \xe2\x80\x9cLooking at the English League, the top improvements are:</p>     Database Dan I. Photograph: Dan Seppings    <p>And the largest losses of form are:</p>     Database Dan II. Photograph: Dan Seppings    <p>Which we think is about as definitive an answer as you\xe2\x80\x99re going to ever get.</p> FAMILIARITY BREEDS CONTEMPT (2) <p>This one was always going to to be trouble. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the maximum number of times one Premier League team can play another in the same season?\xe2\x80\x9d was Richard Shaffer\xe2\x80\x99s question last week. Probably 11, but possibly 12 was our response. \xe2\x80\x9cAu contraire,\xe2\x80\x9d came the reply from, well basically everybody.</p> <p>The general gist was that next season there is a chance that two Premier League teams could be drawn in the same Champions League group, with the restriction on teams from the same association being drawn in the same group not applying to teams to have qualified for the Champions League by winning the Europa League. Uefa, though, have not yet published the full regulations for the 2015-16 tournament so it\xe2\x80\x99s not entirely clear whether or not that will be the case.</p> <p>And in other news: \xe2\x80\x9cYou can add another game to the number of games two teams can play against each other in a season, if they meet in the Champions League and Team A wins the first leg 3-0 and gets a result in the second leg that would put them through but fields an illegal player so it goes down as a 3-0 loss and a play-off is needed,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Brendan O\xe2\x80\x99Mahony. \xe2\x80\x9cUnlikely but more plausible than a league play-off occurring.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to be increasingly common for players to retire from international football to preserve their club careers,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Adam Harcus back in the sepia-tinged endless summer of 2011. \xe2\x80\x9cSo my questions are: what is the youngest someone has retired to do this? And has anyone ever retired from club football but continued to play at international level?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The 24-year-old Milan midfielder Kevin-Prince Boateng has probably become the youngest player to retire from international football because of the physical demands of doing so following his decision to call an end to his career with Ghana earlier this month.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to Kevin, the physical demands of playing for both club and country at high levels are taking a toll on his health,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Ghanaian FA in a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cThe player also explained that in order to remain healthy and stay off any injuries, he has consulted his doctors and family over the matter and has decided to take the decision to excuse himself from national duties since he is on a special training that he has to interrupt to honour national invitations.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>A couple of others have also ended their international careers in their early 20s, though admittedly for reasons other than club priorities. Bernd Schuster, then aged only 20, had been the star of West Germany\xe2\x80\x99s successful 1980 European Championship campaign. Jupp Derwall, the West Germany manager, identified Schuster as the most significant footballer the country had produced since Franz Beckenbauer. Eleven months after that success, though, he was in international exile, aged 21.</p>     Bernd Schuster in fine fettle for Barcelona. Photograph: Bongarts/Bongarts/Getty Images    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI left Barcelona without permission because I wanted to play in a friendly against Brazil,\xe2\x80\x9d said Schuster of the game in May 1981. \xe2\x80\x9cThe club didn\xe2\x80\x99t let me travel because we had a match against Rayo the following day, but I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t miss that game. They finally accepted my idea of playing just 45 minutes. There was a party after the match, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go because I had to wake up early. That\xe2\x80\x99s when everything gets confusing. That night I was told I would never get called up because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t go to the party. I spoke to [Barcelona coach] Udo Lattek so that he would fix everything, but the phone operator confused the last name of the coach with that of a friend of mine. When all was said and done after a series of misunderstandings, I never played for Germany again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Which wasn\xe2\x80\x99t entirely true. By November 1982, having missed out on that year\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup, he was back in the fold.</p> <p>But the new Beckenbauer struggled to work with the old one when Der Kaiser was appointed in 1984 and in February of that year he played his final game for the country, aged 24. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are few midfield players who are really gifted and of those few only a minority are prepared to sweat,\xe2\x80\x9d said Terry Venables, Schuster\xe2\x80\x99s manager at Barcelona. \xe2\x80\x9cHe attracts the ball so well and, of course, when he has it he can kill the opposition with it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great loss for West Germany that he and Franz Beckenbauer don\xe2\x80\x99t get on and Bernd won\xe2\x80\x99t play for his country.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In 1986 the German press mounted a campaign to get him included him in the squad for the World Cup. Beckenbauer ceded to those wishes, but failed to persuade the Barcelona man to return to the fold. And when Schuster finally made himself available once more for the 1994 World Cup, Berti Vogts turned him down.</p> <p>Another player who endured a confusing temporary possible-retirement at the age of 21 is Mark Bosnich, notes Daniel Fitzgerald. The then Aston Villa goalkeeper received a two-week suspension from Fifa after refusing to play for Australia in a World Cup play-off against Canada in July 1993, meaning he missed Villa\xe2\x80\x99s opening game of the season. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s only a one-off,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Villa manager, Ron Atkinson. \xe2\x80\x9cThis will not affect him again because he has retired from international football.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>By October, though, he was back in a Socceroos jersey. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve told Villa I\xe2\x80\x99ll be back in good shape for the Deportivo game and the boss is quite happy with that,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the Observer. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, he\xe2\x80\x99s not happy exactly, but he understands. This is one of the biggest games in Australia\xe2\x80\x99s history. No way would I miss it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Mark Bosnich: retired by Big Ron. Photograph: Jones   David Jones/PA    <p>In 2008 Bosnich tried to clear up the misunderstanding without really clearing it up at all. \xe2\x80\x9cIn 1993, it came out wrongly that I had rejected playing for Australia and I made a vow to myself then that I would never allow that to happen again,\xe2\x80\x9d he told SBS in Australia. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t bore people with the details but back in 1993, I got into a position while at Aston Villa where it was wrongly understood by many that I\xe2\x80\x99d quit the national team \xe2\x80\xa6 I tried to do the right thing by everybody but got burned. That will never be allowed to happen again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As for the other half of the question, several of you pointed out that Pat Jennings kept goal for Northern Ireland in the 1986 World Cup despite having effectively retired from club football the previous year and, as Antonio Novi points out, Srecko Katanec played on for Slovenia after calling an end to his club career with Sampdoria in the summer of 1994.</p> <p>For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive.</p> CAN YOU HELP? <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWatching a game recently with a slightly laboured shout for a back-pass being picked up by the goalkeeper and it got me a-thinking: who was the last goalkeeper to pick up a back-pass legally?\xe2\x80\x9d wonders Chris Thomas. \xe2\x80\x9cTo make things a bit easier, how about we limit that to the major footballing nations and/or internationals? Can\xe2\x80\x99t say fairer than that?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBack in the day I saw the Blackpool goalkeeper Tony Waiters save two penalties whilst losing 3-0 at Leeds,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Peter Clarke. \xe2\x80\x9cDo records exist of a keeper saving three penalties in a match. Misses of course do not count.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI notice that in the current standings of the Portuguese Primera Liga, Academica Coimbra have only managed one win from their first 19 games,\xe2\x80\x9d begins David Williamson. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever despite this they are still outside the relegation places in 16th spot. My question is what is the fewest amount of wins a team has needed to stay up?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com</p>"
