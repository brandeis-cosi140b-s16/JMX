b'Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s Danny Ings has pedigree to match Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s Harry Kane'


b'<p>Scouts from no fewer than three Bundesliga clubs watched Danny Ings in action for England Under-21s at Middlesbrough last week, with Schalke, Borussia M\xc3\xb6nchengladbach and Borussia Dortmund joining a list of admirers that already includes Liverpool, Manchester United and Real Sociedad.</p> <p>It could be that a decision about the Burnley player\xe2\x80\x99s future destination has already been made \xe2\x80\x93 he is out of contract at the end of the season and has been free to talk to suitors for a while \xe2\x80\x93 but anyone interested in running the rule over England strikers of the foreseeable future should make for Turf Moor on Sunday where Ings and Harry Kane are going head to head.</p> <p>Kane has just made his full England debut, scored a goal within seconds and generally become the talk of the nation, creating the impression that Ings has been overtaken already. Though older than his Tottenham rival at 22, Ings has yet to make the step up from Gareth Southgate\xe2\x80\x99s Under-21s, and is expecting to feature in the European Championship at that level this summer. Kane has that tournament on his radar, though you do not score 29 goals in your breakthrough season without getting noticed, and the Spurs striker\xe2\x80\x99s elevation to star status has inevitably led to competing demands on his time in the summer months.</p> <p>Ings\xe2\x80\x99 haul of goals stands at a relatively modest nine, all in the league, though of course he has been playing for a newly promoted side punching above its financial weight in a relegation struggle. The direct comparison with Kane could be misleading; certainly Ings\xe2\x80\x99 team-mate Kieran Trippier has no doubt the Burnley striker will be able to hold his own at a higher level.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHarry Kane has done absolutely magnificently this season, there\xe2\x80\x99s no question about that,\xe2\x80\x9d Trippier says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe found we could stop him playing to an extent, we are going to have to work on doing that again, but it is not just him you have to keep quiet. Look at the quality of players Kane has around him at Tottenham. Christian Eriksen springs to mind but you could go all through the team.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to knock what Kane has achieved, the goals speak for themselves and he fully deserved his call-up, but Ingsy is in his first season in the Premier League and he has done very well too. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any reason why they can\xe2\x80\x99t both go to the top. Ingsy is a fantastic footballer and still only 22. I think he will produce in the next couple of years and soon be scoring 20 or 30 goals a season. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be one of the top strikers in the Premier League, without a doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>If he stays in the Premier League, that is. One of the reasons Ings has attracted attention from abroad, over and above his widely advertised availability at the end of the season, is his technical ability. The Burnley striker is good at all aspects of the game: his heading ability is as good as his shooting, his passing can be as inspired as his finishing and so on. But in addition to positional awareness and the knack of making space for himself by pulling away from his marker, he has the control and speed of thought and movement that beats opponents almost before they realise what is happening.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDanny\xe2\x80\x99s first five yards can be frightening,\xe2\x80\x9d Trippier says. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s rapid with the ball at his feet but so is Harry, though what Harry tends to do is just get into the right place before the ball comes. Sometimes he comes into the hole, then before you know it he is in behind you, that\xe2\x80\x99s how he gets a lot of his goals. They are similar players in some ways but not to the extent where they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t play together. They have played together with England [Under-21s] and they have done well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Spurs go to Turf Moor in pretty much the same frame of mind as Manchester City three weeks ago, knowing that defeat would draw a decisive line under their stated Premier League objective for another season. Tottenham are about as far off a top-four finish as City were from regaining the leadership from Chelsea, whereas the motivation for Burnley remains the same. Premier League survival is still possible, even though City, Spurs and Arsenal make a tough run of home opponents, and home fixtures simply have to be converted into points to keep the season alive.</p> <p>Since picking up a point at Chelsea in mid-February, Burnley have been beaten at Liverpool and Southampton, lost at home to Swansea and managed that famous victory over City last month. Now they must face Spurs and then Arsenal before a few opponents from lower down the table are encountered in the run-in.</p> <p>There is no chance of a Sean Dyche team entertaining the luxury of picking its matches. Every point is there to be fought for, no game is seen as more \xe2\x80\x9cwinnable\xe2\x80\x9d than the next. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery game is a vital game,\xe2\x80\x9d Trippier says, echoing his manager\xe2\x80\x99s weekly sermons on the subject. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know at the start of the season that you have to play everyone else in the league and it is best not to look too far ahead.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe are a team on a tight budget and some weeks, most weeks in fact, we are up against world-class players, but this is what we all signed up for, this is where we want to be. Everybody in the Burnley side believes in each other, and sometimes that can be better than going out buying players. If you worry about the players you are up against it can mess with your head. We are happy to do what the gaffer says and concentrate on our own game.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t mind tough games. We had a tough start to the season, 10 games without a win, but we are still here, still fighting and believing. We just need to carry on doing what we did against City \xe2\x80\x93 press them high and make sure they feel uncomfortable. No one at this club is downbeat. We still have a fighting chance.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
