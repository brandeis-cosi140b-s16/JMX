b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini admits that the next nine days in which they face Arsenal, Bayern Munich and Chelsea will provide the champions with an indicator of how successful their season may be.</p> <p>Manchester City travel to the Emirates Stadium for Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s early kick-off before Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Munich in the opening Champions League group match, and the hosting of Chelsea on Sunday week.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good test because they are three important teams,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are just beginning the season so not one of these games will decide the future but it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to start winning and trying to recover the three points we dropped at home [to Stoke].\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Before Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s visit to the Etihad Stadium for the second match of the campaign, Pellegrini said that, because Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 side are title rivals, the contest was a \xe2\x80\x9csix-pointer\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>The Chilean defines the games against Arsenal and Chelsea in the same way. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, against big rivals it\xe2\x80\x99s always a match of six points but more for the home team,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cFor our team when you play against big teams it\xe2\x80\x99s a very motivated game for all the players so it\xe2\x80\x99s always a game of six points because, if we can beat Arsenal at their ground, for our team that is very good.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini would not be drawn on whether he may rotate his side, though it is understood he has considered replacing his goalkeeper Joe Hart with Willy Caballero as City embark upon the trio of matches.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI really don\xe2\x80\x99t know, we\xe2\x80\x99ll see game by game. We\xe2\x80\x99ll play against Arsenal and one hour and 15 minutes before kick-off you will know which goalkeeper starts. I\xe2\x80\x99m just thinking about Arsenal and on Sunday we\xe2\x80\x99ll start thinking about Bayern,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll try to start with the best team I think should play against Arsenal.&quot;</p> <p>Last season, City defeated Arsenal 6-3 at the Etihad but the manager played down the relevance of that result to Saturday\xe2\x80\x99stoday\xe2\x80\x99s match. \xe2\x80\x9cWe drew 1-1 against Arsenal at Emirates after that game we won here, so it\xe2\x80\x99s a different game and we\xe2\x80\x99re not thinking about what happened last year,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pellegrini. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to play a very good game if we want to win the three points.</p> <p>&quot;It is a very strong team. Every year it is a strong competition to all the other teams that are fighting for the title and this will be the same. It is a strong team with Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez, a very important player, now with [Danny] Welbeck. They always have a very good team but this year they have more players.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a difficult game, a difficult fixture because we have a difficult week. We started better than I thought against Newcastle and Liverpool [winning both] with so many players out with just a few days to prepare those games. After that it was a surprise maybe to lose against Stoke but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we played bad. Now we have this week with two difficult games in the Premier League and a difficult game in the Champions League.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini has only Fernando and Stevan Jovetic injured. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have injured Fernando, he has a muscle problem, maybe a couple of weeks more, and also Stevan Jovetic \xe2\x80\x93 he came back from his national team with a problem in his hamstring. I hope Stevan could be fit next week, thought I am not sure,\xe2\x80\x9d the manager said.</p>'
