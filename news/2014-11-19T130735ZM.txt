b'Malky Mackay given fair hearing and a chance to redeem himself at Wigan | Paul Wilson'


b'<p>Dave Whelan did not get where he is today without knowing how to both spot a bargain and turn it to profitable advantage, so no one should be that surprised he has not only ignored the advice of his MP and interviewed the disgraced former Cardiff manager Malky Mackay for Uwe Rosler\xe2\x80\x99s old job but gone right ahead and appointed him.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMalky Mackay has applied and we will speak to him,\xe2\x80\x9d the Wigan chairman said beforehand, sounding like the most reasonable man in the world for a change. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe he deserves a fair hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Whelan probably did give Mackay a fair hearing. Those who know him well say he will not have taken particularly kindly to being lectured about how to run his own club by a Labour MP, though the possibility exists that Wigan were sold on Mackay before Lisa Nandy\xe2\x80\x99s intervention.</p> <p>The larger question is whether football as a whole is prepared to give Mackay a fair hearing. Not that he can offer much in the way of defence over the \xe2\x80\x9cdisrespectful\xe2\x80\x9d texts that cost him the Crystal Palace job, other than arguing they were part of a private conversation never intended for public consumption. The conversation Wigan are prompting is whether atonement is possible. Ought Mackay to have rendered himself permanently unemployable through his charmless interchanges with his former head of recruitment Iain Moody, or should the game allow him a route back if he shows contrition and promises to behave better in the future?</p> <p>The danger here is that many are depicting Mackay as some sort of sex offender, if not a mass murderer. His crime was being busted by a vengeful former employer for a handful of texts that were undeniably much worse than the \xe2\x80\x9cfriendly banter\xe2\x80\x9d the League Managers Association foolishly suggested.</p> <p>But is it comparable to John Terry\xe2\x80\x99s offensively racist remark to Anton Ferdinand? Ashley Cole went on to win his 100th England cap after famously referring to the FA as a bunch of twats, while Rio Ferdinand has just been sidelined for insulting a stranger on Twitter with his \xe2\x80\x9csket\xe2\x80\x9d comment yet his punishment of a three-match ban and a \xc2\xa325,000 fine was considered harsh by many, including Gary Lineker, Joey Barton and Harry Redknapp.</p> <p>Barton\xe2\x80\x99s point, a good one as it happens, was that Terry received only four matches for his unacceptable racism, so either Ferdinand\xe2\x80\x99s punishment was disproportionate or the Chelsea captain\xe2\x80\x99s was too lenient. But the overriding point to note in the cases of all these footballers is that once a suspension has been served or a fine paid, the career resumes with no further stigma, give or take the odd mocking chant from opposition supporters.</p> <p>Mackay must wish his case could have been treated in a similar manner. Instead he has been out of work for a year, a rumoured FA investigation is yet to report back, and if everyone was to react in the same way as Nandy he might quickly become untouchable, a pariah. \xe2\x80\x9cA little warning would have sufficed, surely?\xe2\x80\x9d Lineker tweeted in support of Ferdinand and his \xe2\x80\x9cridiculously harsh\xe2\x80\x9d ban. In Mackay\xe2\x80\x99s case a severe reprimand might have sufficed, given he is older and supposed to know better, but in the absence of a finite sentence to be served the manager has been getting the cold shoulder on a seemingly endless basis.</p> <p>Some might argue that is what he deserves, not only for being unreconstructed enough to harbour primitive opinions but for being dumb enough to get caught expressing them. Others are uncomfortable with the idea that an eavesdropped private conversation should make a capable manager unemployable overnight. I have to admit I agree with Harry Redknapp on this one. That is itself is something I am normally wary of admitting, though if the alternative is to damn a man for thought crime the QPR manager\xe2\x80\x99s views seem a lot more acceptable.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMalky is not a bad person,\xe2\x80\x9d Redknapp said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not murdered anyone, he\xe2\x80\x99s not a rapist or a paedophile. He\xe2\x80\x99s made a big mistake but it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t finish his life or his football career. It is going to take time for him to get back into the game but people do make mistakes and people should get second chances.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>This might comes as a shock to more sensitive readers but Whelan probably has more in common with Redknapp than Nandy. At the very least the Wigan chairman must have wanted to find out about Mackay for himself, and why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he?</p> <p>For those who still believe Mackay has not been sufficiently punished, has not been punished at all, or can never be sufficiently punished, consider this. A year ago he was everyone\xe2\x80\x99s idea of a promising, progressive manager. It was known he did not see eye to eye with Vincent Tan but it was generally thought that if the Cardiff owner went ahead with his short-sighted scheme to remove him, Mackay would quickly find himself back in work when the next Premier League job became available.</p> <p>It has not worked out like that, largely through Mackay\xe2\x80\x99s own doing. He must regret his actions now, because when a Premier League job did come along it was snatched away from him, and nothing came along to follow it. Now he is reduced to applying for work at a club in the bottom three of the Championship.</p> <p>The new Wigan manager\xe2\x80\x99s brief will simply be to keep the team out of Division One. One way or the other, it may be a while before Mackay finds himself back in the Premier League, so no one can say he is not paying for his mistakes already.</p>'
