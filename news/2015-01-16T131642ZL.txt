b'Luke Shaw: You don\xe2\x80\x99t know how big Manchester United are until you sign'


b'<p>One o\xe2\x80\x99clock is nearing when Luke Shaw stands up and says: \xe2\x80\x9cCan I go to lunch because I\xe2\x80\x99ve literally got one minute?\xe2\x80\x9d The respect the defender holds for Louis van Gaal and the Dutchman\xe2\x80\x99s demand for punctuality is evident; to be even slightly late to join the rest of the squad is anathema. The clock is ticking yet Shaw, who may well be the United and England left-back for the next decade, remains courteous, asking politely to depart. It is a moment that captures the teenager\xe2\x80\x99s rounded character and explains how a breathless past few months \xe2\x80\x93 a \xe2\x80\x9cwhirlwind\xe2\x80\x9d, he says \xe2\x80\x93 has been taken in his stride.</p> <p>To recap, Shaw made his England debut on 5 March last year, replacing his boyhood hero, Ashley Cole, at half-time in a 1-0 friendly win over Denmark at Wembley. Two months later, Roy Hodgson selected the 18-year-old for the World Cup at the same time as United began to firm up their interest in making him the most expensive teenager in history by paying Southampton \xc2\xa330m for his services.</p> <p>Cole was the fall guy for Shaw in the squad for Brazil and the latter made an appearance in the final group game, the draw with Costa Rica, to become the second youngest England player to appear in a World Cup, behind Michael Owen. The transfer to United was sealed on 27 June and less than a month later Shaw was flying to Los Angeles to start a summer tour during which Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s observation that he needed to be fitter was met by a response impressive enough for his manager to cite as an example to the squad.</p> <p>And as if that was not enough, Shaw suffered a hamstring injury just before the season started. His debut did not come until 27 September, a 2-1 win over West Ham United at Old Trafford, and further niggling injuries have limited him to 11 appearances. But there have still been flashes of the quicksilver defending and searing attack play that makes Shaw such an asset.</p>  <p> Related: Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend </p>   <p>Asked to look back at such an intense period, Shaw says: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a whirlwind, crazy. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really think of it like that, I sort of tend to focus on the football. It\xe2\x80\x99s quite surreal how everything\xe2\x80\x99s gone in the last six months \xe2\x80\x93 it was crazy. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to think too much of the past, you just want to focus on what\xe2\x80\x99s coming up and the games coming thick and fast.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>How was Brazil 2014? \xe2\x80\x9cIt was unbelievable,\xe2\x80\x9d Shaw says. \xe2\x80\x9cTo go to the World Cup at that age was something amazing, and I learned a lot, especially with the likes of Bainesy [Leighton Baines]. I was always watching to see what he does, also in training as well \xe2\x80\x93 training with world-class players.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Shaw is a keen observer. \xe2\x80\x9cEspecially when you\xe2\x80\x99re on the bench you want to see what the player in your position is doing. Luckily I had Baines \xe2\x80\x93 he\xe2\x80\x99s one of the best left-backs around. So it was great to be able to watch him and have a conversation with him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Next came a realisation of the sheer size of the club he had joined during a tour that took in LA, Denver, Washington, Detroit and Miami. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t actually know how big it is until you sign for it \xe2\x80\x93 around the whole world, the fan base and everything,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe teams we played as well \xe2\x80\x93 it was sort of weird playing the likes of Real Madrid and Inter and still being 18, it was very nice to be playing against [Cristiano] Ronaldo and Gareth Bale. That tour helped me a lot.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Luke Shaw made his Manchester United debut against LA Galaxy in a pre-season tour to the US, and later played 45 minutes against Internazionale.

A day later, Shaw fronted up to admit the manager was correct, especially given the demands of Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s new wing-back system. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to clear the air,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe some people took it the wrong way \xe2\x80\x93 I think he was trying to help me out and it\xe2\x80\x99s all over now. That was in pre-season and everything\xe2\x80\x99s fine.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Gaal has tinkered with United\xe2\x80\x99s shape, often switching between a three-man defence and the traditional back four. Had Shaw played wing-back previously? \xe2\x80\x9cAt Southampton we played with high full-backs, you could say that\xe2\x80\x99s wing-back, but not particularly, no,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, then suggests he can adopt a more attacking role. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m always learning, especially with the different formations. It will help me in the long run to maybe become a forward player \xe2\x80\x93 on the wing or something.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Asked about that record \xc2\xa330m transfer, Shaw shrugs. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a player coming into Manchester United, I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to adapt like every other, no matter how old I am,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I was 28 or 19, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter \xe2\x80\x93 you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be able to come in here and play the way the manager wants and that\xe2\x80\x99s it. My family brought me up very well. I\xe2\x80\x99m not one to boast, I\xe2\x80\x99m more relaxed and focused on what I need to do.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Heidi Stone, the assistant head principal at Surrey\xe2\x80\x99s Rydens Enterprise School, where Shaw went, describes him as \xe2\x80\x9cpopular both with teachers and peers\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cquite humble and modest. You would never see a sign of arrogance.\xe2\x80\x9d Shaw is happy to hear this. \xe2\x80\x9cEspecially from my teachers. I\xe2\x80\x99m still quite close to some of them because I want to go and visit my old school \xe2\x80\x93 they\xe2\x80\x99re part of the reason of why I am where I am now. If I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have such a good background with them I might have been struggling,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.</p>  <p> Related: Manchester United wrong to sack me, says former scout axed for racial slurs </p>   <p>His professional debut for Southampton, whom he joined as an eight-year-old, came at 16 at Millwall\xe2\x80\x99s New Den on 28 January 2011, in an FA Cup tie. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember I came on at left-wing,\xe2\x80\x9d Shaw says of entering on 77 minutes for Jason Puncheon. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a horrible place, horrible to go to Millwall. I remember warming up and there were fans chanting stuff to you. It was very tough, and I was so tired even though I\xe2\x80\x99d [only] been on for 20 minutes. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t used to that pace and it was a very physical battle because when you go to clubs like Millwall it\xe2\x80\x99s not really a footballing game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>By the time he made his Premier League debut, in November 2012 against Swansea City, he had already achieved something few England footballers have: winning a trophy for the national team, after the Under-16s won the 2011 Montaigu Tournament in France.</p> <p>Shaw scored in the opening group match against Uruguay. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a penalty, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if it went in \xe2\x80\x93 it hit the crossbar and went down to the line but I remember that because we won it, didn\xe2\x80\x99t we?\xe2\x80\x9d he says.</p> <p>United\xe2\x80\x99s outside hopes of winning this season\xe2\x80\x99s title took a tumble after Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 1-0 defeat by Southampton left them 12 points behind Chelsea. But he refuses to give up \xe2\x80\x93 next is Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Queens Park Rangers and the challenge is to win every one of the last 17 matches.</p> <p>Shaw says: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re always focusing on first. We wanted to win the league but obviously it was a massive setback from the defeat on Sunday. So we just need to keep going and take it game by game and hopefully pick up maximum points.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Luke Shaw supports the PlayStation Schools\xe2\x80\x99 Cup, which has increased football tournaments for boys and girls across secondary school age categories, attracting close to 2,000 school entries and 100,000 participants.
