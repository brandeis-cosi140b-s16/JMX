b'<p>Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez has conceded for the first time that Everton are mired in a relegation battle and admits the reaction will determine players\xe2\x80\x99 long-term futures at the club.</p> <p>Everton travel to a resurgent Crystal Palace on Saturday level on points with a team on its third manager since August, having won once in 13 matches. Amid the furore over Kevin Mirallas\xe2\x80\x99s missed penalty as Everton\xe2\x80\x99s appalling run continued in their last game, against West Bromwich Albion, there was also clear dissent against Mart\xc3\xadnez when he withdrew the lively Muhamed Besic, who he claimed was injured.</p> <p>The Everton manager accepts supporters\xe2\x80\x99 frustration is understandable after eight matches without a win and, having previously insisted the club\xe2\x80\x99s ambitions should remain to qualify for Europe, concedes the team is immersed in a fight for survival.</p> <p>Mart\xc3\xadnez, who faces Liverpool and Chelsea in February in the Premier League, described Everton\xe2\x80\x99s predicament as serious. He said: \xe2\x80\x9cUntil you get 40 points everyone is in a relegation battle.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been long enough in this league to understand how difficult it is to get to 40 points. In the same way, I know what we are capable of doing. Last season showed our standard and that is what we are fighting for. We know what level we can reach.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAre we in a negative run of results? Clearly. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone enjoys that but in the same way I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at the way we performed against Manchester City at home, with 10 men for over an hour against West Ham and the way we performed against West Brom. We have 16 games to go and want to treat every one as a final.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Besic\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal in the recent goalless draw against West Bromwich was followed by audible criticism of Ross Barkley\xe2\x80\x99s performance but Mart\xc3\xadnez claims supporters\xe2\x80\x99 patience has not snapped. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was more about my substitution than against Ross,\xe2\x80\x9d said the manager. \xe2\x80\x9cRoss Barkley is a player loved by every Evertonian. I think that was just a show of emotions. That\xe2\x80\x99s normal, I welcome that. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect us as a football club to be happy being nil-nil at home to West Brom, it is as simple as that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mart\xc3\xadnez denied he is experiencing one of the most difficult periods of his managerial career. \xe2\x80\x9cThe hardest moment as a manager is when you look around the dressing room and think \xe2\x80\x99How and where is the next win coming from?\xe2\x80\x99 I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had that feeling here, never,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>Mart\xc3\xadnez also admits players\xe2\x80\x99 futures at Goodison Park rest on how they respond to the pressure of a relegation struggle. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what naturally happens in a football team,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mart\xc3\xadnez. Of course, this is a period when you are judging players. When things are going well you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to disrupt anything, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to lose anything, and when things are going against you, you need to find solutions.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEven more so in our dressing room because the expectations were very different to where we are now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
