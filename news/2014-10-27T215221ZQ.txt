b'QPR v Aston Villa: Premier League \xe2\x80\x94 as it happened | Scott Murray'


b'<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s that. A well-deserved win for QPR, who were as solid and impressive as Villa were lame and abject. Charlie Austin is the two-goal hero, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a fine team performance. After their good but unrewarded display against Liverpool, there\xe2\x80\x99s a sense that Rangers might just have stumbled onto a formula. They move off the bottom of the table, and are now just three points behind plummeting Villa, who have lost five on the bounce now without scoring once. Pity their poor players, who have to look Paul Lambert and Roy Keane in the eye after that.</p>'
