b'<p>SADDLE UP!</p> <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s quite the weekend for horse lovers, featuring as it does both the Aintree Grand National and the Manchester Derby. Though, Ruud van Nistelrooy aside, this is a derby which has never really been linked with the equine world, predominantly because it\xe2\x80\x99s contested by humans, and thus is not of essential interest to the aforementioned horse lovers who, should they have stumbled upon this tea-time email, can feel free to concentrate their attention on Aintree and in particular avoid reading the paragraph they are painfully coming to the end of, which has no real relevance to their hobby whatsoever.</p> <p>Anyway, players from both sides have been remembering favourite derby moments of yore as they gear up for the latest meeting between Manchester\xe2\x80\x99s rumbling footballing juggernauts. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you score against United at Old Trafford it almost gives you shivers,\xe2\x80\x9d purred Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero, who grabbed the winner there in 2013, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause you can feel the tense atmosphere with most of the stadium being really quiet, but the away end going crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI remember the year we beat them 3-2 with Robin van Persie\xe2\x80\x99s free-kick right at the end,\xe2\x80\x9d countered Ashley Young. \xe2\x80\x9cI think looking back after the goal, the players were running off in different directions.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>A celebration not all that different from United\xe2\x80\x99s apparent match-day tactics at times this season then, but with Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s side having recently clicked more emphatically than an irate Xhosa-speaker it\xe2\x80\x99s a good moment to look back at that particular goal. Van Persie\xe2\x80\x99s strike back in December 2012 is topical because, like Jason Puncheon\xe2\x80\x99s winner in City\xe2\x80\x99s most recent game at Crystal Palace, it relied on a member of their wall squirming out of the way of a free-kick as it arrowed goalwards through the space where one of their body parts had until recently been. And ducking in a cowardly and distinctly unimpressive manner is pretty much exactly what City, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s reigning champions, have done in this season\xe2\x80\x99s title race.</p> <p>A run of four wins in 11 league matches has seen them slip from the giddy heights enjoyed on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, when they and Chelsea were level at the top on points, goal difference and goals scored (while Arsenal were 13 points behind in sixth), to their current fourth place, a point behind their crosstown arch-rivals (and two behind the Gunners). And while they might not have walked the walk for some months now, they\xe2\x80\x99re still talking the talk. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course we can still win it,\xe2\x80\x9d insisted Ag\xc3\xbcero of the title. \xe2\x80\x9cIn football, anything can happen.\xe2\x80\x9d Obviously they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to win it (not that the Argentinian could possibly say anything different) so it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to see why Wayne Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s pre-match analysis has identified this as \xe2\x80\x9ca very important game\xe2\x80\x9d for both sides. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the fans and for me, it\xe2\x80\x99s a massive game of pride,\xe2\x80\x9d he concluded and it looks like that\xe2\x80\x99s all that\xe2\x80\x99s really at stake on Sunday. </p> <p>So then, as we enter the final furlong, only Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s insane form is stopping this title run-in from becoming a one-horse race. A little treat at the end there for any equestrian types who foolishly persevered. Sorry.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cQPR was in the paper every day \xe2\x80\xa6 That got on my nerves. That was the big problem for me\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 newspaper columnist \xe2\x80\x98Arry Redknapp claims it was mischief makers, rather than anything to do with him, his management or that surprisingly healthy-looking knee that did for him at Loftus Road, apparently.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf only Sky would cover the FA Cup final in the same way they cover the Masters. Three months of feverish build-up and then when the game starts, we zip to live coverage midway through the second half. Two passes later we can cut to the panel discussing that great Alan Sunderland goal in 1979 before crossing to the stats centre for an in-depth description of the Wembley pitch (YOU KNOW THE GOLF, er, FOOTBALL IS GOING ON RIGHT BEHIND YOU, DON\xe2\x80\x99T YOU?). Then after live coverage of a throw-in, Lawrie Sanchez might reminisce (CAN WE PLEASE, PLEASE SEE SOME GOLF, er, FOOTBALL?) about that great goal in \xe2\x80\x9888 and the panel might enthuse about the terrific game a young English debutant is having (REALLY? WELL HOW ABOUT WE ACTUALLY SEE SOME OF THE GOLF? I MEAN FOOTBALL HE IS PLAYING. THAT MIGHT BE GOOD) before cutting to a goal-kick and a disputed header before Matt Le Tissier describes the magnificent goal we missed while we were enjoying Lawrie Sanchez (FOR THE LOVE OF GOD CAN WE SEE SOME, ANY GOLF? Er, FOOTBALL?). I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing Augusta, er, Wembley looks lovely this time of year\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Guy Campbell.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger saying Arsenal don\xe2\x80\x99t have to sell their best players any more (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Bits and Bobs). But how much are they getting for Jack Wilshere?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Jerry Slaff.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: Ed Taylor, Class Warrior (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters). I was so shocked by his casting of aspersions regarding faux working-class Guardian readers I nearly choked on my quinoa\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Patrick Brennan (and 1,056 others).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

But Mikel John Obi is fit, so \xe2\x80\xa6</p> <p>Meanwhile, over in Arnhem, Chelsea loanee Wallace has been arrested on suspicion of a sexual offence.</p> <p>We don\xe2\x80\x99t know where Sam Allardyce is going to be next season, and it looks like we\xe2\x80\x99re in fine company, because Sam Allardyce doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know where Sam Allardyce is going to be next season either.</p> <p>Dirk Kuyt will return to Feyenoord this summer, nine years after he left the club for pastures new. \xe2\x80\x9cFeyenoord have always been a draw,\xe2\x80\x9d he cheered.</p> <p>Zlatan Ibrahimovic has been placed on the Ligue UUuuuuuuuuuuuuuunnnnnn naughty step to the tune of four games, after proclaiming that he\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x9cnever seen a [good] referee in this $hit country\xe2\x80\x9d and that France \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve PSG\xe2\x80\x9d. But on the up side, Marine Le Pen now doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like him now, so every cloud.In other brushes with officialdom news, His yellow card for an alleged tumble against Rayo Vallecano has been rescinded, allowing Him to plunder an implausible number of goals against Eibar on Saturday.</p> <p>Bayer Leverkusen defender Emir Spahic is being investigated by the state prosecutor over allegedly introducing his head to stadium stewards after their German Cup exit against Bayern Munich. </p> <p>And after waiting for five days for the retake, Leah Williamson held her nerve to finally convert the penalty that took the England Women U-19s side to the European Championships in Israel this summer.</p> STILL WANT MORE? <p>Barney Ronay attached his spectacles to a bit of string, hung them around his neck and wrote about Marcelo Bielsa, the man that we\xe2\x80\x99d probably have to invent if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist.</p> <p>You are the Ref. No, you are. No, you are. No, you are. No, you are. No, you are. No, you [think that does the word count \xe2\x80\x93 Fiver Ed].</p>      <p>Ronnie Moore is on the verge of completing the greatest comeback since Lazarus at Hartlepool, and he told Louise Taylor all about it.</p> <p>Ever wanted your own Louis van Gaal random phrase generator? No? Well we\xe2\x80\x99ve got one here for you anyway, just in case.</p> <p>There are loads of enjoyable things to look forward to this weekend, but instead of any of that Barry Glendenning, Paul Doyle and Gregg Bakowski picked out some stuff about football and the Premier League.</p> <p>Tim Sherwood and his old Tottenham tactics board will be reunited this weekend, and David Hytner wrote about that emotional event.</p> <p>Oh, and if it\xe2\x80\x99s your thing \xe2\x80\xa6 you can follow Big Website on Big Social FaceSpace.</p> SIGN UP TO THE FIVER <p>Want your very own copy of our free tea-timely(ish) email sent direct to your inbox?
