b'Fiver | Won\xe2\x80\x99t you just give those rabonas a rest | Nick Ames'


b'POCHETTINO\xe2\x80\x99S BIG VASE IS HALF EMPTY <p>Two fundamental tenets keep the Fiver honest of a weekday. The first? You\xe2\x80\x99re only as good as your last frivolous tea-time football spiel. And the second? The next frivolous tea-time football spiel is the most important. As this is very much the present one, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know where that logic actually leaves us, but one thing is for certain: you, Thursday reader, are the central person in our world for as long as these words trip from the keyboard. The only one. Our fickle Friday fans are nothing to us.</p> <p>We offer you this commitment because, on a Big Vase night, the most clear-cut sound to reach the ears tends to be that of shifting goalposts. Roll up, roll up for\xe2\x80\xa6 well, not all that much, but did you know we\xe2\x80\x99re playing Everton at home in three days\xe2\x80\x99 time?</p> <p>Mauricio Pochettino was accused of not liking football all that much when he looked something less than mindblown by Erik Lamela\xe2\x80\x99s mindblowing \xe2\x80\x98rabona\xe2\x80\x99 against Asteras last month, but it\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely the Spurs manager meant to cause offence. No, it seems more probable that Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s mind was elsewhere: on an important match with Newcastle the coming Sunday.</p> <p>That\xe2\x80\x99s if his forerunner to tonight\xe2\x80\x99s titanic struggle against already-eliminated Partizan Belgrade is anything to go by. Pochettino found himself suitably bored to look ahead to the impact that a straightforward workout might have on their bid to nail down more Big Vase next year. How might that noble cause be furthered? By playing their next league game on Monday, not in a mere three days\xe2\x80\x99 time.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think it is a good idea maybe if you play Thursday and afterwards Monday,\xe2\x80\x9d he opined. \xe2\x80\x9cOne day extra is very good for the players to recover because maybe you play in Turkey, Serbia or Greece and you arrive 4am. It changes your sleep and after it is Friday, you need to train, then Saturday, then Sunday you play at one o\xe2\x80\x99clock. It is very difficult for the players.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Spurs play Partizan at White Hart Lane, London, tonight and then face fellow Big Vase contenders Everton at White Hart Lane, London, on Sunday at 4pm. Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s point can be judged even more clearly when you consider that a whopping four of the players who started in their win at Asteras two weeks ago were deployed similarly in the subsequent Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 home defeat against Stoke. Six of those who started the home game that served up Lamela\xe2\x80\x99s showpiece were in from the beginning of a 2-1 defeat to Newcastle three days later. And here\xe2\x80\x99s the clincher: ONE \xe2\x80\x93 that man being Hugo Lloris \xe2\x80\x93 of the heroes who drew 0-0 at Partizan in September started the 1-0 home humbling by West Brom the following Sunday.</p> <p>This tells us three things: one is that Spurs\xe2\x80\x99 record after Big Vase really isn\xe2\x80\x99t very good, another other is that nobody is being flogged to death here, and a third is that Pochettino is just not particularly bothered about what happens tonight. Do we have to link the three? The shift in training patterns isn\xe2\x80\x99t totally convenient, but who exactly is being overworked? To these eyes, it would seem more apposite for Pochettino, after Spurs\xe2\x80\x99 regulation win this evening, to feel thankful for the extra minutes granted to squad players and await eagerly the chance to get aboard the hamster wheel again after 66 hours\xe2\x80\x99 rest.</p> <p>But no. Perhaps you\xe2\x80\x99ll remember the local newspaper interview from February when the then-Southampton manager said this: \xe2\x80\x9cIn my opinion [Big Vase] is not an attractive competition. That is my personal opinion, I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about anyone else, it\xe2\x80\x99s my personal opinion and as Mauricio Pochettino there is no interest in [Big Vase].</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think it is a competition that kills you in the sense that there are a lot of mid-table teams that put a lot of effort into [Big Vase] and then are not able to do anything in the league.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Maybe Spurs saw an opportunity to hire a manager who knew the job spec perfectly. Regardless, it seems better that his players give their rabonas a rest until Sunday. And perhaps it is advisable that the fans take a well-earned breather until then, too.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Follow Wolfsburg 3-3 Everton in Big Vase with Paul Doyle at 6pm GMT and Spurs 3-1 Partizan Belgrade with Jacob Steinberg at 8.05pm.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY     Andr\xc3\xa9s Iniesta at his family vineyard in Spain Photograph: PR    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI want to share this charming space with travellers who are looking for a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Since then we have scored eight goals and won both games played. I just wanted to put my thanks on record whilst wondering if any other Letter O\xe2\x80\x99 the Day alumni have experienced a similar upturn in fortunes following the life changing, CV altering accolade of being the best of a very bad bunch on any given day\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Stephen Yoxall.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Has a team ever scored two goals with the opposition touching the ball?\xe2\x80\x99 (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Still Want Mores). Erm \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Jerry Case (and 1,056 other really clever pedants who know the difference between with and without).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was unaware that Iniesta also has a home in Hampshire (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Bits and Bobs). If this is the case, maybe Wanyama can just go for a stroll down the street to Andres\xe2\x80\x99 place and ask him for another shirt?\xe2\x80\x9d - Glen Stockdale (and another 1,056 others).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis morning I arrived in work, after a few days off, to discover that while the Monday and Wednesday edition of The Fiver were sat in my inbox Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s was not. Naturally I assumed this a typical (and not unexpected) error affecting all of Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s long suffering subscribers. So when I got to Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s letters I was expecting numerous complaints only to find it was business as usual. Had I been in work on Tuesday, I am certain I would have written a letter making some sort of witty comparison between Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero carrying Man City and Jac Naylor doing likewise in Holby City and in the process winning the letter o\xe2\x80\x99 the day (and more importantly the prize). I find it very suspicious that a two time letter o\xe2\x80\x99 the day winner was left off the mailing list for a day. Is this an attempt to restrict previous winners from tasting victory again? After the recent fiasco of Daniel Doody\xe2\x80\x99s questionable win and now this I believe there an enquiry by Big Paper is required, which will hopefully remove the corruption within Fiver Towers\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Olcan Shaw.</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
