b'Football transfer rumours: Paul Pogba to Arsenal?'


b'<p>Arsenal fans \xe2\x80\x93 everything is going to be all right! Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger has come to his senses and, according to this story the Mill is reading, he is finally going to part with big cash for the top-class midfielder they have been crying out for since Patrick Vieira scooted off to Juventus in 2005. And, irony of ironies, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be signing him from Juventus. Want to know who it is? Of course you do.</p> <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s Paul Pogba! This is great news. At long last, there is going to be something there. Paul Pogba, heading to Arsenal, for \xc2\xa340m. This is a game-changer.</p> <p>Oh, wait. Hang on. What\xe2\x80\x99s this? The Mill hadn\xe2\x80\x99t quite finished reading the story \xe2\x80\x93 but Arsenal will face competition for the France ace from \xe2\x80\xa6 uh oh. Oh dear. Oh no. Oh, this is awkward. Manchester City are also interested in Pogba and they reckon he would be the perfect replacement for Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to start again.</p> <p>Manchester City fans \xe2\x80\x93 everything is going to continue being fabulous! You\xe2\x80\x99re going to sign Paul Pogba from Juventus for \xc2\xa340m!</p> <p>And it does not get much better for Arsenal this morning. They want to sign Sebastian Lichtsteiner but Juventus will not let the right-back leave, Southampton are insisting that Morgan Schneiderlin is going nowhere in January and Big Sam Allardyce has slapped a \xc2\xa320m price tag on Winston Reid, whose West Ham contract runs out at the end of the season. That\xe2\x80\x99s a ballsy game of double bluff that Big Sam is playing.</p> <p>Still, at least Arsenal look like pipping Real Madrid to the \xc2\xa312m signing of Lucas Silva, the latest Brazilian wonderkid to hop off the production line, and at least they\xe2\x80\x99re not Fernando Torres. Milan have decided that they want shot of the \xc2\xa350m man before the end of his two-year loan spell in Italy and Chelsea, who have no need for him either, are so desperate to get him off their books that they will offer him around for free to Premier League clubs in January. The Mill can think of a team up north who could do with a new striker. Step forward \xe2\x80\xa6 Liverpool! It will happen.</p> <p>Roma are planning on completely anglicising their defence and, with Ashley Cole already on their books, they want to bring Stoke City\xe2\x80\x99s Ryan Shawcross to the Italian capital. Stoke will console themselves by signing Joel Campbell on loan from Arsenal. Perhaps they watched that video of the Arsenal fans at Stoke train station telling Campbell to get out while he still can. Clever Stoke scouts!</p> <p>Liverpool are planning on ruining the reputation of the Barcelona right-back Mart\xc3\xadn Montoya, while City are lining up an \xc2\xa38m move for the Estudiantes midfielder, Joaquin Correa. City have all the fun.</p>'
