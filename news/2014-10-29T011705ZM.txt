b'Mark Clattenburg \xe2\x80\x98axed for weekend games\xe2\x80\x99 after going to Ed Sheeran gig'


b'<p>Mark Clattenburg will not take charge of a Premier League game this weekend having travelled alone to West Bromwich Albion\xe2\x80\x99s 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace last Saturday so he could make it back to Newcastle in time to attend an Ed Sheeran concert, according to reports.</p> <p>Referees must travel with their assistants to and from games for security and integrity purposes but Clattenburg drove by himself to The Hawthorns so he could return home in enough time to attend the gig at the Metro Radio Arena, according to the Daily Mail and the Sun.</p> <p>Clattenburg also allegedly spoke on the phone to the Crystal Palace manager, Neil Warnock, while in his car after the game. Premier League rules allow referees to speak to managers only when their assistants are present or when given permission by the Professional Game Match Officials. That regulation is intended to stop employees speaking to managers in potentially highly-charged circumstances where witnesses may be needed.</p> <p>Warnock claimed after the match that West Brom\xe2\x80\x99s Craig Dawson had almost \xe2\x80\x9cassaulted\xe2\x80\x9d Palace\xe2\x80\x99s goalkeeper Juli\xc3\xa1n Speroni when Victor Anichebe scored in the 2-2 draw, comparing the incident to Peter Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s challenge on Bert Trautmann in the 1956 FA Cup final. </p> <p>Warnock said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s almost an assault, how one of the four officials can\xe2\x80\x99t be in a position to see that. Dawson had smashed him in the face and I am lost for words. He\xe2\x80\x99s had a two- or three-yard run-up and smashed him in the face. No wonder Juli\xc3\xa1n is a bit groggy. </p>     Neil Warnock accused Mark Clattenburg of missing a serious foul on Palace\xe2\x80\x99s keeper Julian Speroni at West Brom.

I can\xe2\x80\x99t say anything about the referee or I get fined and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to because I thought he had a cracking game but he had made two or three really bad mistakes.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Clattenburg also failed to give Palace a penalty when Wilfried Zaha appeared to be fouled by Dawson. Warnock said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t win, we had four or five surrounding the referee last week and we were told that was wrong. He had a good game but two, maybe three, decisions went against us and it\xe2\x80\x99s cost us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Clattenburg, widely regarded as England\xe2\x80\x99s top referee since Howard Webb\xe2\x80\x99s retirement, has had a career dogged by controversies, including the ordeal of being wrongly accused of racially abusing Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s John Obi Mikel, and an eight-month suspension following an investigation into his \xe2\x80\x9cprivate business affairs\xe2\x80\x9d. He was also cleared of wrongdoing last season when Southampton claimed he had \xe2\x80\x9cabused and insulted\xe2\x80\x9d Adam Lallana. </p> <p>In 2009, the then-Manchester City manager Mark Hughes alleged that Clattenburg had based a decision to send off Craig Bellamy on a personal dislike for the striker, with a source claiming the referee had asked City staff as he walked by them: \xe2\x80\x9cHow do you work with Craig Bellamy all week?\xe2\x80\x9d </p> <p>Hughes said: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t appreciate when referees start making comments about who they do or do not like in my team. They might be having a laugh and a joke. I have to be careful here as we are talking about integrity.\xe2\x80\x9d The FA asked Hughes to explain his comments, but took no further action.</p>'
