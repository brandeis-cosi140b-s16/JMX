b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho on Arsenal reunion: F\xc3\xa0bregas joined Chelsea to win titles'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has claimed Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas\xe2\x80\x99s principal motivation when opting to join Chelsea last summer in preference to a potential return to Arsenal was a desire to win titles, as the Spain midfielder prepares to visit the Emirates Stadium for the first time with his new club.</p> <p>F\xc3\xa0bregas joined Arsenal as a 16-year-old from Barcelona in 2003, establishing himself as one of the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s most accomplished players and winning the 2005 FA Cup, before returning to the Catalan club in 2011. When it became clear that his three-year spell back in Spain was to be curtailed last summer, Arsenal effectively waived first refusal to re-sign the player, leading to the 27-year-old moving to Stamford Bridge.</p> <p>Asked before Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s clash between the current top two how he had convinced F\xc3\xa0bregas to move to Chelsea, Mourinho said: \xe2\x80\x9cI just promised him we\xe2\x80\x99d build a team very adapted to his style of play. That he was going to be an important player in our project. And that, normally, good projects end with titles. He was looking for that. That\xe2\x80\x99s all I can say.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The former Arsenal captain will be braced for a hostile reception at the Emirates though Mourinho, whose side can move 13 points clear of their rivals with victory, has no qualms about the player\xe2\x80\x99s ability to cope in that atmosphere. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not worried with that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cFrank Lampard played at Stamford Bridge without any kind of problem and with a good reception. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see a reason for F\xc3\xa0bregas not to have the same at the Emirates.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut, if he has some bad reactions, I think he\xe2\x80\x99s one of the players who is more than ready. He played in Barcelona with an Arsenal shirt. Why can\xe2\x80\x99t he play at the Emirates with a Chelsea shirt? No problem.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho will assess Diego Costa\xe2\x80\x99s fitness on Saturday before determining whether Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s leading scorer can return from a hamstring injury in the derby. Didier Drogba, who has scored 15 goals in 15 appearances against Arsenal for Chelsea and Galatasaray, is likely to start the game, with Dominic Solanke, 17, standing by to feature on the bench while Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my continues his rehabilitation from a calf injury.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDidier for sure, he\xe2\x80\x99s good, fine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho when asked about his forward options for the game. \xe2\x80\x9cR\xc3\xa9my not for sure. Diego, let\xe2\x80\x99s make a decision tomorrow. Diego\xe2\x80\x99s a very important player for us, but the reality is we are coping with the difficulties of every match without him. R\xc3\xa9my did well for us. Didier is doing well for us.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe team is playing in a different way to adapt to those two, but we are doing our job. We decided Solanke wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t play yesterday with the under-21s, also to have him fresh and ready. Didier and Solanke, or Didier and Diego. We make that decision tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Despite a tricky last couple of months, Mourinho said he was happy with his team\xe2\x80\x99s recent performances. \xe2\x80\x9cWe played amazingly well during the most part of the season, scoring a lot of goals and controlling games very well through the quality of our possession. In the last period we are more strategic, less artistic, but we are having results. I would love Diego to be back, but I trust the other [strikers].\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho also spoke of his often strained relationship with the Arsenal manager, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger, who pushed him in the fixture at Stamford Bridge in October. \xe2\x80\x9cFor me, he\xe2\x80\x99s not my rival,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Chelsea manager. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel that. He\xe2\x80\x99s a manager of a big club in the same city where I work and live. A big club with the same objectives that we have in the competitions we play. With that comes a bit of rivalry.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
