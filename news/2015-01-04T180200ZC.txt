b'<p>It took some half-time tinkering but Chelsea cruised into the fourth round of the FA Cup thanks to a trio of second-half goals and in the end the only shock came after the match when Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho issued an apology to the referee.</p> <p>The Chelsea manager had criticised Kevin Friend in a post-match television interview for not awarding a penalty for a handball by Craig Cathcart before Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my scored the second goal but a subsequent conversation with the official made him realise the criticism was unfair, so Mourinho began his press conference by saying sorry.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was speaking with the referee and I want to apologise for my comments on television,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause what he did was great refereeing. He saw that there was a penalty \xe2\x80\x93 and was ready to give a penalty \xe2\x80\x93 but decided that the ball was going to R\xc3\xa9my and he waited a couple of seconds. He told me that, if R\xc3\xa9my did not control the ball or if the ball went over the bar, he would have given the penalty. I was complaining but it was good refereeing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s original anger with Friend might have stemmed from his previous assertion that Chelsea are the victims of a campaign in which their alleged offences are highlighted more than those of other teams but it was probably exacerbated by his discomfort at watching his team\xe2\x80\x99s toils against an admirable Watford side, especially in a scoreless first half.</p> <p>Any of the 6,000 Watford fans who had made the short journey to Stamford Bridge fearing their team would be made to pay for Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day thrashing by Tottenham must have been soothed by the sluggish start made by the hosts and the smart one by Slavisa Jokanovic\xe2\x80\x99s men.</p> <p>Chelsea, fielding only three of the players who began against Spurs, were pedestrian during the first period while Watford were solid and tenacious in a 4-5-1 formation and carried a threat on the counterattack. The visitors were even the first to force the opposing goalkeeper into action, as long-range shots from Daniel Tozser and Troy Deeney drew saves from Petr Cech.</p> <p>Off-target headers from Didier Drogba and Gary Cahill were the closest Chelsea came to scoring in a first half in which the absences of Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas, Eden Hazard and Nemanja Matic left the Premier League side badly short of creativity. Unsurprisinly, Ramires and Mikel John Obi did not cut it as replacement playmakers. On the stroke of half-time Odion Ighalo dragged badly wide from the edge of the Chelsea box after another counterattack from Watford. Mourinho, who said the first half was \xe2\x80\x9ca bit sad\xe2\x80\x9d, sought to perk his team up for the second half by introducing Diego Costa and Willian in place of Oscar and the particularly disappointing Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle.</p> <p>The substitutes broke the deadlock with much-needed ingenuity. Costa, whose movement was beginning to tear holes in the visiting defence, foraged down the right before offering Willian a shooting opportunity from 20 yards. The Brazilian seized it with style, curling the ball into the top corner.</p> <p>They had struggled to gain the lead, but Chelsea never looked like relinquishing it. Their grip on the game already seemed ominously imperious before Chelsea secured victory with a second goal in the 70th minute. Again Costa was instrumental in the creation. After a one-two with Drogba he unleashed a shot from 15 yards that was blocked by Cathcart before the ball dropped to R\xc3\xa9my who, with the referee watching to see what would happen, walloped it into the net from 12 yards.</p> <p>Kurt Zouma\xe2\x80\x99s headed goal two minutes later served as extra recompense for a 20-year-old defender who deputised well in place of John Terry.</p> <p>Mourinho also confirmed after the match that goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer is leaving Chelsea to join Leicester City.</p> <p>Man of the match Diego Costa (Chelsea)</p>'
