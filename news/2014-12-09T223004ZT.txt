b'Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s Kyle Walker on brink of comeback after nine months out'


b'<p>Kyle Walker will travel to Istanbul with the Tottenham Hotspur squad and he is in line to play his first competitive football in nine months against Besiktas in the Europa League on Thursday.</p> <p>The England right-back has endured a nightmarish period because of an abdominal injury which has ruled him out since March. It ended his World Cup dream and required surgery in September. Tottenham had hoped to avoid the operation but in the end they realised it was the only way to fix the problem.</p> <p>Mauricio Pochettino, the manager who joined in the summer, has yet to be able to call on Walker and right-back has been a problem position, with Kyle Naughton, Eric Dier and Vlad Chiriches trying to provide the solution.</p> <p>Walker returned to full training three weeks ago and he has turned out for the club\xe2\x80\x99s under-21 team as one of their over-age players. His last senior match was in the Europa League last-16 first leg against Benfica on 13 March.</p> <p>He hopes to feature against Besitkas in Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s final tie of the group phase \xe2\x80\x93 they need a point to ensure their progress into the last 32 as the winners of the section, which would increase their chances of a more favourable draw. If they were to lose, Slaven Bilic\xe2\x80\x99s Besiktas would jump over them to win the group and Tottenham would advance as the runners-up.</p> <p>Pochettino intends to make changes to his starting XI. The captain, Youn\xc3\xa8s Kaboul, is likely to return in central defence after being on the bench for the past three games in the Premier League against Everton, Chelsea and Crystal Palace. Emmanuel Adebayor, the striker, who has been missing in recent weeks because of injury and then illness, will not travel.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe I will rest some players,\xe2\x80\x9d Pochettino said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a lot of games ahead in the league and we play Newcastle in the Capital One Cup next Wednesday. We need to manage the players and we have many injury problems because it\xe2\x80\x99s tough for our players.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
