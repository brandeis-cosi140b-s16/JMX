b'Lucas Moura continues to frustrate at PSG despite his ability | Igor Mladenovic'


b'<p>When Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the top goalscorer and assist provider in Ligue 1, was substituted in the last game of last season, he walked off the Parc des Princes to a standing ovation as Paris Saint-Germain were thrashing Montpellier 4-0. His last move on the pitch was as unexpected and spontaneous as some of those goals and assists. He walked straight to his team-mate Lucas Moura and strapped his captain\xe2\x80\x99s armband around the winger\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.</p> <p>Just 18 minutes into the opening game of this season, the Brazil international capitalised on a poor pass from the opposition to burst into the penalty area but overlooked the Swede, unmarked in the goal area. An unsuccessful stepover led him to lose the ball and earn an earful from his captain, who barked obscenities at him as Reims levelled the match four minutes later.</p> <p>The turnaround from Zlatan was a symbol of Moura\xe2\x80\x99s career. A player everyone would like to see fulfil his potential keeps frustrating even his most ardent supporters.</p> <p>Transferred from S\xc3\xa3o Paulo to Paris Saint-Germain in January 2013 for \xc2\xa344.3m, picking the French side in preference to Manchester United, Moura has not made the impact expected for club and country.</p> <p>Once a hugely popular figure in Brazil, running rings around Brazilian league full-backs since 2010, Moura quickly featured in the national team, making his debut aged 19. He now has 31 caps for Brazil.</p> <p>When he joined the S\xc3\xa3o Paulo academy in 2005 he endured a rigorous schedule, attending school in the morning before taking two buses across the sprawling city to reach the Barra Funda training grounds in the afternoon, returning home way past midnight.</p> <p>His parents Jorge and Fatima were worried by their son\xe2\x80\x99s exhausting lifestyle but they knew it was the path he had chosen and offered their full support. \xe2\x80\x9cWere it not for my parents and brother Thiago I would not be where I am today,\xe2\x80\x9d concedes the young man who excelled as a student but also showed signs of unruliness, staunchly refusing to eat beans \xe2\x80\x93 staple diet for many Brazilians \xe2\x80\x93 and once coming home with dozens of stings after kicking a beehive.</p> <p>Misdeeds would lead to the harshest punishment. \xe2\x80\x9cThe cruellest way in which you could punish him would be to take away his football. He would cry on and on,\xe2\x80\x9d his brother recalls.</p> <p>This happened when he persuaded a young boy from his neighbourhood to pay 10 Brazilian reals for a self-made kite whose fabrication had cost 30 times less. Told off by his father after using the money to construct 30 new kites, he apologised and would give a special autograph to the boy\xe2\x80\x99s brother, an ardent S\xc3\xa3o Paulo fan, many years later.</p> <p>Just as he did not always toe the line as a youth, Moura finds it difficult to measure up on football pitches today.</p> <p>The Brazilian\xe2\x80\x99s failure to integrate a tactical dimension to his game makes him lack the awareness required to break up narrow defences on European pitches.</p> <p>A propensity to cut inside and over-enthusiastic dribbling (5.4 dribbles per game in the Champions League last season, nearly a quarter of his total attempted passes) have earned him a reputation for playing it solo, despite boasting the third highest number of assists in Ligue 1 behind Ibrahimovic and James Rodr\xc3\xadguez last season.</p> <p>While it is a stretch to say Manchester United dodged a bullet not signing the winger, it is difficult to picture Moura conforming to Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s tactics.</p> <p>His trademark acceleration and explosiveness, however, remain untarnished which he showed against Marseille at the Parc des Princes last season.</p> <p>The solo effort did not lead to a goal but hinted at the winger\xe2\x80\x99s ability to raise his game on big occasions. It was reminiscent of the run his illustrious compatriot Ronaldinho made for PSG, also against Marseille, 10 years earlier. However, comparisons between the two Brazilians stop here.</p> <p>Moura\xe2\x80\x99s positioning off the ball is often careless and hinders his progress, leading to only 18 league starts last season. Laurent Blanc, PSG\xe2\x80\x99s manager, decided on rotation with Edinson Cavani even though Moura\xe2\x80\x99s transfer fee was the Brazilian league record until Neymar moved to Barcelona.</p> <p>Rotation was an alien term to the S\xc3\xa3o Paulo star who would lead every attack in Brazil. Reduced game time took a toll on his confidence and played a part in the biggest disappointment of his career, on the day his side celebrated a second consecutive league title.</p> <p>A full Brazil international since the age of 19, brought up alongside Oscar at S\xc3\xa3o Paulo and named best player of the 2011 South American Youth Championship ahead of Neymar, he was left out of Luiz Felipe Scolari\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup squad on May 7, the day PSG won the French league.</p> <p>He had led title celebrations the year before but was unable to take part this time, tearfully sitting away from his team-mates after the final whistle, staring into the distance at his childhood dream fading away.</p> <p>Although few of Scolari\xe2\x80\x99s decisions can be vindicated with the benefit of hindsight, no eyebrows were raised in Brazil at Moura\xe2\x80\x99s absence from his squad. The consensus was the winger had not progressed in an area of the pitch already plugged with talent.</p> <p>He reacted by scoring his fourth and fifth goals of the season and producing arguably two of his finest performances, leading Ibrahimovic to reward him with the captain\xe2\x80\x99s armband on final matchday.</p> <p>Now summer has come and gone, and his sadness is shared by 200 million Brazilians, Moura has a point to prove. Ibrahimovic\xe2\x80\x99s earful underlines how difficult it is for him to shake off old habits.</p> <p>Although it took a year for his compatriot Ra\xc3\xad to get used to the PSG environment, before establishing himself as one of the club\xe2\x80\x99s greatest ever players in the mid-1990s, time is running out for Moura to live up to his fantastic potential.</p>'
