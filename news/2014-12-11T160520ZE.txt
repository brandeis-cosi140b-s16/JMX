b'English players not invited to Europe\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League party | James Riach'


b'<p>Three English clubs have qualified for the knockout stage of the Champions League yet\xc2\xa0the number of domestic players featuring in the competition has fallen in recent years. Only 21 Englishmen played in the group stage, with the nation ranked ninth overall in terms of player participation.</p> <p>Europe\xe2\x80\x99s elite club tournament is dominated by Brazilians, Spaniards, Germans, Portuguese and Frenchmen at a time when the future of English football, and the player pathway to international level, has been exhaustively discussed. The Football Association\xe2\x80\x99s director of elite development, Dan Ashworth, revealed details last week of a new \xe2\x80\x9cDNA\xe2\x80\x9d blueprint to ensure future success but competing on the top club stage is regarded by many as a key component in an individual\xe2\x80\x99s progress.</p> <p>Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal will all be represented in the Champions League\xe2\x80\x99s last 16 which will be drawn at Uefa HQ in Nyon on Monday. However, should the paucity of English players that played for those sides in the group stage, along with Liverpool who exited the competition, be a cause for concern when compared to the thriving numbers from other countries?</p> <p>Of the 21 Englishmen to have featured this season, three of those played for Manchester City and four for Chelsea. Four of the 21 have retired from international football \xe2\x80\x93 Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard, John Terry and Ashley Cole \xe2\x80\x93 and four others experienced only 45 minutes of action or less. Arsenal had the most English players with seven while Liverpool had six.</p> <p>With Arsenal winning 3-0 in Istanbul on Tuesday night against Galatasaray Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger replaced Aaron Ramsey with Ainsley Maitland-Niles at half\xe2\x80\x91time and with 13 minutes of the match remaining brought on Stefan O\xe2\x80\x99Connor for Mathieu Debuchy. At Stamford Bridge on Wednesday much had been made of Ruben Loftus-Cheek\xe2\x80\x99s Chelsea debut and the midfielder played the last seven minutes of a comfortable victory over Sporting Lisbon. Dominic Solanke featured for 17 minutes during the 6-0 thrashing of Maribor earlier in the campaign.</p> <p>The 21 English players accumulated 5,940 minutes on the pitch during the group stage compared with 6,089 last season and 7,301 the year before. England is ranked narrowly behind the Netherlands on minutes played with Russia and Belarus among the nations just below them.</p> <p>Mourinho, speaking in the buildup up to Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s fixture with Sporting, said Loftus-Cheek\xe2\x80\x99s elevation to the first-team should be remembered as \xe2\x80\x9cacademy day\xe2\x80\x9d as recognition for the work done with youngsters at Cobham. He did, though, add the caveat: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t bring kids through the academy, the best thing is to close the academy. If the kids are not good enough or the work not good enough and you don\xe2\x80\x99t bring kids up, then close the door and use the money to buy players.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Manchester City this week opened their new \xc2\xa3200m academy but, in recent times, like Chelsea they have been dominated by foreign talent especially in the Champions League. Uefa rules stipulate that eight homegrown players must be named in the 25-man Champions League squad but clubs can select starting XIs at their discretion.</p> <p>City\xe2\x80\x99s European squad for the current campaign was cut to 21 because the club breached financial fair play regulations and their \xe2\x80\x9chomegrown\xe2\x80\x9d quota was consequently cut to five \xe2\x80\x93 a group that contained the France left-back Ga\xc3\xabl Clichy and Belgium\xe2\x80\x99s Dedryck Boyata.</p> <p>G\xc3\xa9rard Houllier, the former Liverpool manager, believes playing in the Champions League is hugely beneficial to a player\xe2\x80\x99s development and argues that if English players are good enough they will play. \xe2\x80\x9cThe top level, the top competitions are the World Cup, European Championship and Champions League,\xe2\x80\x9d said Houllier. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Champions League is played every year so if you manage to get some matches under your belt in that competition it will obviously raise your level.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn the Champions League you are confronted with different types of player, different tactics and different problems to solve. That forces you to use different assets and enlarge your own quality. It\xe2\x80\x99s important.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAt Liverpool I was lucky, I was spoiled for choice, I had Owen, Fowler, Heskey, Gerrard, Carragher, Ince, Murphy. That was very rare even for that time. Now you don\xe2\x80\x99t see as many English players in the top teams. But you would see them if they are good enough to play.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The number of English players to have featured in the Champions League group stage is dwarfed by other nations and is the lowest in the past five years, albeit only by one compared with 2013\xe2\x80\x9114. Seventy-five Spanish players were involved while 68 Brazilians featured as did 51 Germans.</p> <p>If a nation\xe2\x80\x99s population is considered it would be remarkable should England\xe2\x80\x99s numbers ever reach those heights. However, Houllier believes the situation will improve. \xe2\x80\x9cThe FA chairman is trying to develop young English players, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a financial issue,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the English are good enough they will play. I think it will be better in the coming years. The English culture of effort and intensity, maybe more mistakes are made, but the English are as technical as other nations.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cTo me the problem is at the start. If we produce better players we will get them playing in the Premiership, at the top level, and then in the Champions League. More English players playing in the Premier League is a start.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ashworth, speaking at St George\xe2\x80\x99s Park last week, spoke of the importance of \xe2\x80\x9cexperiencing high-pressure games, playing for titles and cups and in Europe\xe2\x80\x9d while Roy Hodgson said after his England side\xe2\x80\x99s early departure from\xc2\xa0the World Cup: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to have to accept that some young players \xe2\x80\x93 who I think are good enough and can win games for England \xe2\x80\x93 will not always be first choice for their teams in\xc2\xa0England.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The number of English players in the Champions League will undoubtedly dwindle as the tournament progresses, with Mourinho and Wenger unlikely to risk their promising young players in decisive knockout matches. It raises questions about the quality of elite English talent and the chances that they have to flourish on the biggest stage.</p>     '
