b'<p>Asmile broke out across Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s face when he was asked to consider a question that seemed to have been devised with a headline in mind. Does Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s acquisition of Wilfried Bony mean they now boast the strongest striking lineup in Europe? \xe2\x80\x9cWell let me see, it is so difficult to compare,\xe2\x80\x9d the City manager said, defusing the prompt with his usual mixture of politeness and amusement. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you go to Barcelona you have Su\xc3\xa1rez, Messi, Neymar and Pedro. If you go to Real Madrid you have Ronaldo, Bale, Hern\xc3\xa1ndez and James. They are very important players, too. You can review all the teams and they have important strikers and important players. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we are the only ones.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Bony will be unable to make his debut for a while following his \xc2\xa325m move from Swansea due to his involvement with Ivory Coast in the Africa Cup of Nations. City are also missing Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 against Arsenal on Sunday afternoon for the same reason, though with Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero and Vincent Kompany fit again Pellegrini is confident his squad will be strong enough to cope.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cA good squad is the key to a title challenge,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini explained. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is impossible to win the title just with a team. You see how many games we have and how many injuries we pick up \xe2\x80\x93 not just our team, all the others too \xe2\x80\x93 and then you have suspensions and internationals. You must have a strong squad with two players for each position, and a style of play that everyone is familiar with, then you have genuine competition for places as well as back-up if anyone then has to miss matches.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>That is more or less what Gooners have been telling Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger for the past few seasons, though rarely is the Arsenal manager credited with the flip side of his perceived intransigence in the transfer market, his success at moving players on at just the right time. City know that better than most, having spent more than \xc2\xa380m on Arsenal players in the past five years without ever seeming to have obtained full value for money.</p> <p>Samir Nasri, now injured, has been just about the best of the lot, though many would argue he has not yet lived up to the potential glimpsed in his early years at Arsenal. Emmanuel Adebayor and Kolo Tour\xc3\xa9 failed to work out, Ga\xc3\xabl Clichy has been quietly consistent without setting the Etihad on fire, while Bacary Sagna, signed on a free, is now expecting to be cut from the European squad to make way for Bony.</p> <p>Financially, Arsenal had the better of all those deals. They made money from players they were able to replace and for the most part did not see their old boys go on to produce outstanding performances for their new clubs.</p> <p>On the other hand, Nasri has two titles to his name and is in the running for a third. He may not have proved a stellar performer in Manchester, though he fits neatly into Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s squad concept. With two dozen or so players of that quality you are bound to be in with a chance.</p> <p>Only one player, Sagna, has actually arrived from Arsenal on Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s watch, but he recognises that both clubs want to play attacking football with technical players, so are often attracted to a similar type of talent. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the players who came here from Arsenal are very good,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am happy with all of them. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if we are always in the market for the same type of player as Arsenal, but I can tell you that all the big teams always want good players.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>There were no City players, nonetheless, in Fifa\xe2\x80\x99s recently announced team of 2014. In fact there were no England-based players at all, unless a case is going to be made for \xc3\x81ngel di Mar\xc3\xada, and as English champions that must hurt City more than the rest. Maybe if Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero had stayed fit for longer at the World Cup or if Spain had given David Silva more of a platform it might have been different, but Pellegrini suspects progress will have to be made in the Champions League for his players to get the international recognition they deserve.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI personally feel the Premier League is more important than the Champions League, and I think a lot of fans feel that way too,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a more satisfying prize to win because you have to be good all year round.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLuck plays more of a part in the Champions League, especially in the knockout stages. You can win it if you hit form at the right time, though of course you need to be a good team to get that far in the first place. But though I would never put the domestic league secondary to the Champions League it is clear this club must improve in Europe. It is what all the important teams must do every year, one step more that we must take, and I hope we can achieve success in the Champions League soon. I think we have a stronger squad this year than last. We can keep improving.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Bony should prove that, once he starts his City career. Even Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho complimented City on signing a good player, but Pellegrini countered the Chelsea manager\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that City are flouting the financial fair play rules by admitting that he does not fully understand them either.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI have said before that I don\xe2\x80\x99t really understand FFP,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini said. \xe2\x80\x9cSome clubs can buy a player for \xc2\xa370m but we cannot do it and Chelsea cannot do it. We are not playing by different rules to anyone else, we are among the clubs being affected by the rules.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
