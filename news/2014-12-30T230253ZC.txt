b'<p>Chelsea are in discussions with AFC Wimbledon over buying their home ground, subject to the League Two side being granted planning permission to build a new stadium in the London borough of Merton.</p> <p>Wimbledon, who will host Liverpool in an FA Cup third round tie on 5 January, are hoping to build a new stadium near their former ground at Plough Lane having played all of their home games at Kingsmeadow since their formation in 2002.</p> <p>The Dons took over the leasehold of the stadium in March 2003, with former owners Kingstonian continuing to play their games at the stadium as tenants. Under the terms of the proposed sale to Chelsea, the Ryman Premier League club would be allowed to continue to play there, with the Premier League leaders intending to host youth team and women\xe2\x80\x99s matches at the ground.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI can confirm Chelsea FC is in preliminary discussions with AFC Wimbledon regarding taking control of the Kingsmeadow Stadium in order to play our academy and women\xe2\x80\x99s matches there, should AFC Wimbledon proceed with its intended move to Plough Lane,\xe2\x80\x9d said a Chelsea spokesman.</p> <p>Last month, Wimbledon submitted a planning application to build a new stadium on the site of the Wimbledon Greyhound track, which is adjacent to their original home.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe Dons Trust, owners of AFC Wimbledon, can confirm that the club has been in discussions with a number of organisations, including Chelsea Football Club, over the future of Kingsmeadow, should our club\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to move to a new stadium in Wimbledon be approved by Merton Council,\xe2\x80\x9d read a statement on AFC Wimbledon\xe2\x80\x99s website on Tuesday.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThese discussions are confidential and each proposal is being thoroughly evaluated to ensure it provides the best outcome for the area and the club.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cKingston Borough Council and Kingstonian FC, of course, have been briefed about the discussions. Any change of ownership of Kingsmeadow is a Restricted Action which requires approval by the membership of The Dons Trust before it can be completed.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn the event that the Dons Trust Board believes that acceptable terms have been negotiated, then these will be presented to the membership for their consideration. Until then we cannot not comment any further.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Kingstonian co-chairman Malcolm Winwright added: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are all aware that there are developments and we are talking to AFC Wimbledon on a regular basis.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe have to wait and see what happens \xe2\x80\x93 there is a lot of conjecture going around and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t very helpful. We are comfortable about everything that\xe2\x80\x99s happening at the moment.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
