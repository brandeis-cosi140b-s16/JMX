b'Premier League tactical preview: how teams have changed since last season'


b'Arsenal     Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s line-ups, this season and last    <p>Mathieu Debuchy is a straight swap for Bacary Sagna, but Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez gives another dimension to the attack \xe2\x80\x93 he should play on the right until Theo Walcott returns, then switch to centre-forward.</p> <p>Verdict: stronger</p> Aston Villa     Aston Villa\xe2\x80\x99s line-ups, this season and last    <p>Villa fans aren\xe2\x80\x99t particularly excited about the signings of Kieran Richardson, Philippe Senderos and Joe Cole, but realistically they\xe2\x80\x99re upgrades on what they had in those positions last season.</p> <p>Verdict: stronger</p> Burnley     Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s line-ups, this season and last    <p>Sean Dyche may field an almost identical side, although with Sam Vokes out injured for the first half of the campaign, and Lukas Jutkiewicz signed as a replacement, Burnley actually have a weaker XI.</p> <p>Verdict: weaker</p> Chelsea     Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s line-ups, this season and last    <p>Chelsea no longer have obvious weaknesses. They\xe2\x80\x99re stronger in goal, Filipe Lu\xc3\xads\xe2\x80\x99 arrival means that both full-back positions have been improved, while Cesc F\xc3\xa1bregas and Diego Costa are also upgrades.</p> <p>Verdict: stronger</p> Crystal Palace     Crystal Palace\xe2\x80\x99s line-ups, this season and last    <p>Tony Pulis found a winning formula after taking charge in November, strengthening the side with some astute January purchases. There have been few inspiring additions, ultimately costing the club Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s services.</p> <p>Verdict: unchanged</p> Everton     Everton\xe2\x80\x99s line-ups, this season and last    <p>Why change a winning formula? Two of Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s buys were simply permanent signings of Gareth Barry and Romelu Lukaku, and while Muhamed Besic looks good, he won\xe2\x80\x99t be guaranteed a start.</p> <p>Verdict: unchanged</p> Hull City     Hull\xe2\x80\x99s line-ups, this season and last    <p>Steve Bruce generally used a 3-5-2 last season, but the signings of Tom Ince and Robert Snodgrass suggest he\xe2\x80\x99ll use wide midfielders \xe2\x80\x93 in a 4-4-2 system, Hull have more individual quality.</p> <p>Verdict: stronger</p> Leicester City     Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s line-ups, this season and last    <p>None of Nigel Pearson\xe2\x80\x99s signings would look out of place in the Championship, and despite several minor upgrades, Leicester will have to depend upon collective harmony rather than individual quality.</p> <p>Verdict: stronger</p> Liverpool     Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s line-ups, this season and last    <p>Brendan Rodgers has bolstered his squad with the proceeds of Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez\xe2\x80\x99s sale, which means more scope for rotation and some tactical alternatives, but they will be weaker without the 31-goal Uruguayan.</p> <p>Verdict: weaker</p> Manchester City     Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s line-ups, this season and last    <p>Eliaquim Mangala apart Manuel Pellegrini has improved his squad rather than his starting XI \xe2\x80\x93 the arrivals of Bacary Sagna, Frank Lampard and Fernando will be useful, but he has already found a winning formula.</p> <p>Verdict: unchanged</p> Manchester United     Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s line-ups, this season and last    <p>Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s preference for a 3-4-1-2 system means Juan Mata, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie can all play in their favoured positions, and Manchester United already look more exciting.</p> <p>Verdict: stronger</p> Newcastle United     Newcastle United\xe2\x80\x99s line-ups, this season and last    <p>Newcastle will play in the same format, but it feels like they\xe2\x80\x99ve downgraded at right-back, haven\xe2\x80\x99t properly replaced Yohan Cabaye and Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my, and other mid-table sides look in better shape.</p> <p>Verdict: weaker</p> Queens Park Rangers     QPR\xe2\x80\x99s line-ups, this season and last    <p>Rio Ferdinand, Steven Caulker and Mauricio Isla are all good buys, and if QPR can retain two talented players returning from loan, Adel Taarabt and Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my, this appears a good side.</p> <p>Verdict: stronger</p> Southampton     Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s line-ups, this season and last    <p>Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s side has been decimated, and Ronald Koeman may need to make more signings before the transfer window shuts, but even a current XI looks capable of staying in the Premier League.</p> <p>Verdict: weaker</p> Stoke City     Stoke City\xe2\x80\x99s line-ups, this season and last    <p>Bojan Krkic and Mame Biram Diouf provide Mark Hughes with more attacking options, and he could drop a midfielder to accommodate a quartet of attackers, which should bring more goals.</p> <p>Verdict: stronger</p> Sunderland     Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s line-ups, this season and last    <p>Gustavo Poyet has tried to replace some of the weaker members of last season\xe2\x80\x99s side, but the standard hasn\xe2\x80\x99t sufficiently increased. Jack Rodwell is forever injured, while neither full-back is top-quality.</p> <p>Verdict: unchanged</p> Swansea City     Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s line-ups, this season and last    <p>Swansea have largely kept defence and midfield intact while signing talented attacking players in Gylfi Sigurdsson, Jefferson Montero and Baf\xc3\xa9timbi Gomis, so while Michu has left, Swansea have strengthened.</p> <p>Verdict: stronger</p> Tottenham Hotspur     Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s line-ups, this season and last    <p>This was a squad built for Andr\xc3\xa9 Villas-Boas, and with Mauricio Pochettino preaching a similar brand of high-tempo, heavy-pressing football, he could get the best out of a relatively unchanged side.</p> <p>Verdict: unchanged</p> West Bromwich Albion     West Brom\xe2\x80\x99s line-ups, this season and last    <p>A plethora of signings means West Brom have a large squad, but the likes of Christian Gamboa and Brown Ideye are gambles, and may struggle in the Premier League.</p> <p>Verdict: weaker</p> West Ham United     West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s line-ups, this season and last Photograph: /Guardian    <p>Both full-backs have been replaced, but neither addition is spectacular. Up front, however, Enner Valencia is an upgrade on Andy Carroll, and Mauro Z\xc3\xa1rate is a decent second striker.</p> <p>Verdict: stronger</p>'
