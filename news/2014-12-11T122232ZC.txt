b"Champions League review: Liverpool's lost identity and Benfica's curse"


b'Is there hope for the second-placed teams? <p>Congratulations are in order to all the teams who have qualified for the knockout stages but the celebrations of the ones who finished second may be cut short if any of them are masochistic enough to recall the brutal nature of last season\xe2\x80\x99s round of 16, when eight mostly drama-free ties made a mockery of the idea of the Champions League as a tournament that permits the underdog to have its day. To recap, the aggregate score was 38-13 in favour of the group winners and the only contest that resembled a fair fight was when Olympiakos went toe-to-toe with Manchester United, which may have had something to do with the identity of the English side\xe2\x80\x99s manager. Even then, despite losing the first leg 2-0 in Greece, United still progressed thanks to Robin van Persie\xe2\x80\x99s hat-trick at Old Trafford, briefly giving David Moyes some welcome respite.</p> <p>Galatasaray also held Chelsea to a 1-1 draw in Turkey before losing a tepid second leg 2-0 at Stamford Bridge but otherwise each tie was effectively over as a spectacle after the first legs, as the first-placed sides twisted the knife in ruthless fashion. The most one-sided matches saw Real Madrid win 6-1 at Schalke, Borussia Dortmund win 4-2 at Zenit St Petersburg and Paris Saint-Germain thump Bayer Leverkusen 4-0 in Germany, while the limitations of Arsenal and Manchester City were exposed in respective 2-0 defeats by Bayern Munich and Barcelona, both of whom took advantage of their opponents having men sent off. At least Milan had some hope after only losing 1-0 to Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid at San Siro \xe2\x80\x93 until the second leg 4-1 in Spain, that is. </p>     Gareth Bale scores one of Real Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s six goals against Schalke during the first-leg rout in last season\xe2\x80\x99s competition. Photograph: Helios de la Rubia/Real Madrid via Getty Images    <p>Those results suggested that the gap in class is widening, even within Europe\xe2\x80\x99s premier competition, and there was not much encouragement at the same stage two seasons ago. Two second-placed sides made it past the last-16 but one of them was Madrid, who beat United, and that was only because they had found themselves in the same group as Dortmund, who were beaten in the final by Bayern. </p> <p>For Uefa, it should be a concern that its product was marked by such a lack of competitiveness last season that we might as well have just skipped straight through to the quarter-finals, but the growing trend of superclubs who hoover up the world\xe2\x80\x99s best players means that teams who are merely very good are at risk of feeling like also-rans when they come up against the elite. </p> <p>The hope is that it will be more open this season and there is a stronger look to some of the second-placed sides and, indeed, a weaker look to some of the winners. PSG, Juventus, Arsenal, City and perhaps Shakhtar Donetsk would fancy themselves on their day if they were drawn against Monaco or Porto, for instance.</p> <p>While it is true that many people will not want to be deprived of seeing names taking each other on at the business end of the competition, the same old faces can become a little boring to look at year after year. It never hurts to keep things fresh by having a few upsets along the way. JS</p> Liverpool have lost their identity <p>There was no hard-luck story for Liverpool against FC Basel, despite Lazar Markovic\xe2\x80\x99s controversial red card and the late siege on the Swiss goal that was sparked by Steven Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s trademark heroics. Markovic\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal was harsh, although not an incorrect decision from Bjorn Kuipers given how needless it was for the Serbian to flail his fingers in the vicinity of Behrang Safari\xe2\x80\x99s face, but ultimately Liverpool were confronted by the realisation that they simply had not been good enough over the course of a group that many will feel should not have posed them so many difficulties.</p> <p>Brendan Rodgers must take his share of the blame for a curious team selection against Basel. His midfield was unable to provide enough support for the isolated Rickie Lambert and it was strange that Adam Lallana and Philippe Coutinho, two creative players who might have been able to pick the Basel lock, started on the bench on a night when Liverpool needed to win, while the decision to play the much-maligned Jos\xc3\xa9 Enrique instead of Alberto Moreno at left-back was a head-scratcher.</p>     Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers looks exasperated in the 1-1 draw with Basel at Anfield. Photograph: Magi Haroun/Rex    <p>A lot of the calls made by Rodgers in the past few months have raised a few eyebrows on Merseyside and the lack of faith Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s manager appears to have in the players who arrived in the summer is a source of unease, and this is not just about Mario Balotelli. Lambert, for example, was given a thankless task on his own up front in the first half and was then removed at half-time, only for Liverpool to spend much of the second half flinging crosses into the Basel box. </p> <p>There is a lack of clear thinking at Anfield. Last season, they blew teams away with the breathlessness of their football but now they plod through games, seemingly reliant on Raheem Sterling, a kid who has had too much responsibility thrown on his shoulders, to do something unexpected. It is wishful thinking.</p> <p>The most damning charge against Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s plan against Basel is that it was hard to work out what it was and that has been the case on too many occasions this season. They are not a passing side, they are not a counter-attacking side, they are not a side that plays with width and the shakiness of their defending makes it difficult for them to sit back and absorb pressure. Exactly what are they meant to be?</p> <p>While it is true that they are are missing Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez and also that their attack will have more thrust when Daniel Sturridge returns from injury in the new year, those excuses will fall on deaf ears if results do not improve soon. JS</p> PSG made to pay     Lucas, right, is consoled by Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s Neymar after Paris Saint-Germain\xe2\x80\x99s 3-1 defeat. Photograph: Albert Gea/Reuters    <p>Luis Enrique went for the jugular against Paris Saint-Germain, sending out an attacking trident of Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez, Neymar and Pedro with Lionel Messi roaming free behind them. Yet PSG might still have got the result they need to stay on top of the group if not for some lamentable failings. Lucas Moura squandered two clear chances, sloppiness by Thiago Silva and David Luiz contributed to Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s goals and, most confusing of all, the manager, Laurent Blanc, made the mystifying decision to take off Marco Verratti in the 62nd minute even though the Italian was excelling in midfield. PSG were made to regret those lapses, as otherwise the French champions showed they are the most menacing of the group runners-up. Whichever winner gets drawn against them will wonder whether it was worth it. PD</p> The curse of Jorge Jesus?     Benfica\xe2\x80\x99s Jorge Jesus watches on as his side crash out of the Champions League. Photograph: Carlos Costa/Carlos Costa/NurPhoto/Corbis    <p>In each of the past two seasons Benfica recovered from Champions League elimination to go on and reach the Europa League final, their failure to win either invoking lots of prattle about the curse of B\xc3\xa9la Guttmann. This year, however, they will not get a chance to salve their pain, as the 0-0 home draw with Leverkusen condemned them to the bottom of their group. That intensifies the focus on Jorge Jesus\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League record, the manager having guided the club to the knockout stages only once in six seasons.

Winners and losers <p>Winners ... French football: When Monaco changed policy in the summer and let stars such as Radamel Falcao and James Rodr\xc3\xadguez leave, there were fears that they would embarrass themselves in the Champions League. Instead the side that are seventh in Ligue 1 flourished in Europe, finishing top of a difficult group. That achievement will likely benefit some other French club because it ensured Ligue 1 remained sixth in the Uefa coefficients, just ahead of Russia, and means Ligue 1 will not lose a Champions League spot.

Zenit St Petersburg: The Russians crashed out after a 2-0 defeat to Monaco, who snuck top spot in Group C despite only scoring four goals (that is not a record, by the way - Villarreal won their group in the 2005-06 season after scoring three goals). Still, at least Andr\xc3\xa9 Villas-Boas has been presented with an opportunity to win the Europa League for the second time.
