b'<p>Click to enlarge, and debate the strip below the line. </p> Keith Hackett&apos;s verdict <p>1) Equipment is tightly defined in the laws: items such as &quot;undershorts or tights&quot; are permitted, but additional equipment such as snoods or padded shorts are not. So ask the player to leave the pitch and get changed \xe2\x80\x93 he can return when the ball is next out of play, once you have checked he is wearing proper kit. Thanks to Joseph Cummins. 2) Regretably, his tactic might well be rewarded. You have no option but to dismiss the goalkeeper \xe2\x80\x93 and there is no requirement in the laws for you then to equalise the number of players involved: that only applies before the shoot-out begins. So the keeper&apos;s side can indeed now use their star striker to take the potentially decisive kick. It&apos;s clearly not a fair situation, and it&apos;s an anomaly that should be addressed. John Lennon wins the shirt. 3) Yes: the player is using what counts as an artificial aid to improve his performance. On top of that, there is clearly a risk of chalk remaining on the ball and getting into players&apos; eyes. So as soon as you see him using the chalk, inform him that it is not allowed, and request that any ballboy equipped with the chalk dispenses with it immediately. Thanks to Salah Salah.</p> Competition: win a T-shirt of your choice     Philosophy Football Shirt Photograph: Observer    <p>For a chance to win a Philosophy Football T-shirt of your choice from the Guardian range send us your questions for You are the Ref to you.are.the.ref@observer.co.uk.
