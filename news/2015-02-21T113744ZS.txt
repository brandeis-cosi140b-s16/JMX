b'Samir Nasri: returning hero Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 can lift Manchester City for key games'


b'<p>Samir Nasri believes Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chead is in the right place\xe2\x80\x9d for the decisive phase of Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s title defence and Champions League challenge after the midfielder led the Ivory Coast to the Africa Cup of Nations triumph in Equatorial Guinea earlier this month.</p> <p>Tour\xc3\xa9, 31, is set to make his first appearance for the club since the tournament finished in Saturday evening\xe2\x80\x99s home game against Newcastle United. The champions will hope to avoid losing ground to Chelsea, who could be 10 points ahead by the time City\xe2\x80\x99s match begins. The league leaders play Burnley at Stamford Bridge in a 3pm kick-off.</p> <p>While Wilfried Bony, City\xe2\x80\x99s new \xc2\xa325m striker and Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s international team-mate, is set for his debut, Nasri, who is a close friend of Tour\xc3\xa9, believes the victory in Equatorial Guinea will allow the midfielder to focus on the closing 13 league games and the last 16 Champions League tie with Barcelona, the first leg of which is on Tuesday.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken with Yaya and it was something that he was waiting for, now he has it and his head is going to be in the right place and we know how important he is,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Frenchman, who believes both Tour\xc3\xa9 and Bony could be vital.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYes, especially after their win they are going to come back very happy. Wilfried Bony, we just hope he\xe2\x80\x99s going to continue his run he had with Swansea, scoring goal after goal and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see at the end of season.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Despite the gap to Chelsea, Nasri is insistent the champions have not given the title defence up. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, because the two times we won the league we were behind as well and we just caught them at the end,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe season is still long, the Champions League is going to come as well and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have a lot of games. So hopefully they [Chelsea] are going to make a mistake and we are going to try to get in behind and try to sneak in at the end.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
