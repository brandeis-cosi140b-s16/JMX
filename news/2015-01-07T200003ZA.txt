b'Asian Cup preview: Group D'


b'Japan  <p>Star men </p> <p>Keisuke Honda - Burdened with the playboy good looks and the tag of being the \xe2\x80\x98new Hidetoshi Nakata\xe2\x80\x99, Keisuke Honda\xe2\x80\x99s form has improved since signing with AC Milan. </p> <p>Shinji Kagawa - Along with Honda, Borussia Dortmund\xe2\x80\x99s Kagawa pulls the strings in attack, and their preternatural understanding makes them the two most dangerous players at the tournament.</p> <p>Coach </p> <p>Javier Aguirre - Replacing Alberto Zaccheroni after a hugely disappointing showing at the World Cup, the Mexican former national team coach is a curious choice. With a solid, but not overly distinguished career, Aguirre will desperately want to win this tournament to shift focus from recent match-fixing allegations from his time coaching in Spain.</p> <p>Pedigree \xe2\x80\x93 They\xe2\x80\x99re four-times champions, the only Asian side to ever crack Fifa\xe2\x80\x99s top 10 rankings and there are none better at the Asian Cup than Japan. Widely expected to be one half of the final, the Blue Samurai will have to guard against hubris to navigate a tricky path to victory.</p> <p>Serial champions \xe2\x80\x93 Kashima Antlers. With seven crowns the team from \xe2\x80\x98deer island\xe2\x80\x99 are the most successful in J-League history. They\xe2\x80\x99ve not won since 2009 though, although they make their Asian Champions League return next season.</p> <p>Great sporting moments \xe2\x80\x93 At the 1964 Toyko Olympics, Japan surprised the world by grabbing gold in the Women\xe2\x80\x99s Volleyball against powerhouses the Soviet Union and Poland \xe2\x80\x93 dubbed the \xe2\x80\x98Oriental Witches\xe2\x80\x99 the physically far smaller Japanese surprised the world with a new technique: the rolling dive. </p> <p>Distance travelled to get to Australia \xe2\x80\x93 the shortest of any nation attending the Asian Cup, a cruisey 8,000km (or just under 10 hours flying time).</p> <p>What would they be doing if not playing football? Sumo wrestling is considered the national sport, but the national obsession is the introduced species, baseball. Arriving on Japanese shores in 1872 during the Meiji Restoration, more people play it than any other sport. Success at the Olympic Games and the now-defunct Baseball World Cup has eluded Japan, but they have won the World Baseball Classic twice.</p> <p>Random fact \xe2\x80\x93 Toyko-Yokahama is the largest urban conurbation anywhere on earth, with more than 37m people in an area one-tenth the size of Tasmania. </p> <p>Random Australian connection \xe2\x80\x93 Graham Arnold, only the second Australian to manage a J-League side, was sacked five weeks into the season. His side finished 14th (of 18) and by the season\xe2\x80\x99s end five of the nine foreign coaches had been sacked.</p> Jordan     Ray Wilkins during his time at Fulham. The Englishman is now the coach of Jordan. Photograph: Clive Rose/Getty Images    <p>Star men </p> <p>Abdallah Deeb - A mobile striker, Deeb was the first Jordanian to play in Europe, signing with KV Mechelen in Belgium before returning to the gulf. </p> <p>Amer Shafi - Goalkeeper Shafi, nicknamed the \xe2\x80\x98Whale of Asia\xe2\x80\x99, is an accomplished and vocal leader. Expect the captain to boss it at the back.</p> <p>Coach </p> <p>Ray Wilkins - The erstwhile former Chelsea caretaker manager and brother of former Brighton &amp; Hove Albion boss Dean, Wilkins only took the top job in September, and has failed to win in six outings since.</p> <p>Pedigree \xe2\x80\x93 Ranked 20-odd places above Australia, Jordan are no slouches and have never failed to get out of the group stages in their three appearances at the Asian Cup. </p> <p>Serial champions \xe2\x80\x93 Al-Faisaly SC, the Eagles of Amman, may have won 32 titles, but they are very much a sinking force. Eclipsed by rivals Al-Wehdat SC who have won six of the last 10 championships; remarkably, not a single player from Al-Faisaly made the Jordanian squad.</p> <p>Great sporting moments \xe2\x80\x93 Despite never having won a medal at the Olympics, Jordan won two bronzes at the Seoul Games in 1988. The catch? It was in Taekwondo, which was only a demonstration sport until Sydney in 2000.</p> <p>Distance travelled to get to Australia \xe2\x80\x93 14,000km.</p> <p>What would they be doing if not playing football? Although small, rugby union is gaining some popularity in Jordan. A club match between Aqaba Sharks and a side from Amman claims the record of being the lowest ever altitude game of rugby union, played on the eastern shore of the Dead Sea at 400m below sea level.</p> <p>Random fact \xe2\x80\x93 The country is no relation to the model Jordan.</p> <p>Random Australian connection \xe2\x80\x93 Socceroo great Lucas Neill had the unenviable record of approaching 100 caps yet having never scored for Australia. He rectified this in the penultimate game of the 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign with his maiden goal \xe2\x80\x93 against Jordan.</p> Iraq     Iraq captain Younis Mahmoud celebrates scoring in the final of the 2007 Asian Cup. Photograph: Jerry Lampen/Reuters    <p>Star men </p> <p>Younis Mahmoud - Captain Mahmoud may be without a club presently, but the hero of 2007 is still the focal point in attack.</p> <p> Ali Adnan - One who continues to catch the eye. Napoli tried unsuccessfully to pry him away from the Turkish Super Lig with a bid of \xe2\x82\xac7m. </p> <p>Humam Tariq - The gem in the squad, though, is cultured midfielder Tariq, who became the youngest ever player to appear for the national side, aged just 16.</p> <p>Coach </p> <p>Radhi Shenaishil - A hero as a player, Shenaishil starred in the Iraqi 1989 Under-20 World Cup side that beat Spain, Norway and Diego Simeone\xe2\x80\x99s Argentina \xe2\x80\x93 scoring the decisive goal in a 1-0 win over the six-times champions. He\xe2\x80\x99s only held the reins for three games though, none of which he\xe2\x80\x99s won.</p> <p>Pedigree \xe2\x80\x93 Shock champions in 2007, don\xe2\x80\x99t rule Iraq out from figuring in the closing stages of the tournament; they\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking to improve on their 2000, 2004, and 2011 performances where they went out each time in the quarter-finals, and they can call on almost 50,000 Iraqi nationals now living in Australia for support.</p> <p>Serial champions \xe2\x80\x93 Al Zawraa. with 12 titles nobody comes close to matching the Baghdad giants; their last title came in 2011 with Radhi Shenaishil in charge, but he\xe2\x80\x99s spurned his former club by including none of their players in his squad, and has instead chosen nine players from current champions Al Shorta.</p> <p>Great sporting moments \xe2\x80\x93 You can\xe2\x80\x99t go past the surprise 2007 Asian Cup victory, which was the classic major tournament fairytale \xe2\x80\x93 a war-ravaged nation defies all the odds, and brings pride back to its people. Brilliant.</p> <p>Distance travelled to get to Australia \xe2\x80\x93 13,000km.</p> <p>What would they be doing if not playing football? Working in the oil industry; crude oil provides 90% of government revenue and 80% of its foreign exchange earnings, but with one in four Iraqis living below the poverty line it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear how far the money flows.</p> <p>Random fact \xe2\x80\x93 Long regarded the cradle of civilisation, researchers claim the vast majority of Irish and British people can still claim their ancestry back to Iraq.</p> <p>Random Australian connection \xe2\x80\x93 Bernd Stange, the former Perth Glory manager and NSL winner, went on to coach the Iraq national side in 2002 before war forced him to leave his position </p> Palestine     Murad Said of Palestine, right, battles for the ball during a friendly against China. Photograph: ChinaFotoPress via Getty Images    <p>Star men</p> <p>Ashraf Nu\xe2\x80\x99man - Palestine\xe2\x80\x99s star and all-time leading goalscorer, his goals brought them success at the 2014 AFC Challenge Cup, which secured their qualification for this tournament. A better player than his long-lost relative Gary.</p> <p>Coach </p> <p>Ahmad El-Hassan or Saeb Jendeya - Such is the chaos and politics surrounding the Palestinian team, we can\xe2\x80\x99t even guarantee who the actual coach is. Saeb Jendeya is a popular former player and captain who was appointed coach in September 2014. But Ahmad El-Hassan was then appointed the next month in a move seen by some as a cynical tick-box exercise as he has an \xe2\x80\x98A\xe2\x80\x99 coaching licence \xe2\x80\x93 an AFC requirement.</p> <p>Pedigree \xe2\x80\x93 This will be Palestine\xe2\x80\x99s first appearance at the Asian Cup and in all honesty, nobody knows what kind of side will turn up. Rumours that only 14 of the 23 players selected even arrived in Australia and coaching uncertainty don\xe2\x80\x99t help, but rest assured that whoever wears the shirt will give their all.</p>              <p>Serial champions \xe2\x80\x93 Taraji Wadi Al-Nes. With four West Bank titles to their name, the team from just outside Bethlehem are the reigning champions. Hilal Al-Quds is coached by the former national team manager, though, and they have supplied at least eight players to this squad.</p> <p>Great sporting moments \xe2\x80\x93 Admitted back into Fifa in 1998, Palestine scored shock wins against more fancied Gulf neighbours such as UAE and Qatar to announce themselves at the 1999 Pan Arab Games. They finished third after losing to eventual winners Jordan.</p> <p>Distance travelled to get to Australia \xe2\x80\x93 14,000km, the most onerous journey of all nations attending, and that\xe2\x80\x99s not including the checkpoints, visas and general administrative tightrope walk to get here.</p> <p>What would they be doing if not playing football? Picking wildflowers. With its temperate climate the Palestinian hills are home to wild poppies, jonquils and irises that make it a popular destination for walkers. If you can get there.</p> <p>Random fact \xe2\x80\x93 During the 2008 \xe2\x80\x98Operation Cast Lead\xe2\x80\x99 Israeli military offensive, three national team players \xe2\x80\x93 Ayman Alkurd, Shadi Sbakhe, and Wajeh Moshtahe \xe2\x80\x93 were killed in Gaza.</p> <p>Random Australian connection \xe2\x80\x93 Australia have never played Palestine at senior level but should Australia finish top of Group A and Palestine survive the group, they could meet in the semis. </p>'
