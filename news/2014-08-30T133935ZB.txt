b'Burnley v Manchester United: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0as it happenend | Scott Murray'


b'<p>Welbeck skips down the inside-right channel and into the Burnley area. He claims a corner off Shackell, but he\xe2\x80\x99s had the last touch. And that\xe2\x80\x99s that. It\xe2\x80\x99s the first point of the season for Burnley, and United are still looking for their first win. The result was about right on the balance of play, though United will look to those two penalty decisions, the one in the first half especially. Burnley very impressive, then, and United looking much better in attack. And the best thing is, nobody\xe2\x80\x99s in crisis! It\xe2\x80\x99d be lovely if everyone remembered that.</p>'
