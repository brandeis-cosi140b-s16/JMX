b'<p>Well, that was good fun. Liverpool played their best match since their win over Tottenham in August and will be both aggrieved not to have given their overall dominance, but also relieved to have escaped with a point after equalising when they had 10 men. Ultimately they were let down by not taking their chances and by not holding on to their lead just before half-time. But they will be pleased with the way that they played and the fight that showed after going behind. A draw takes them above Everton and into 10th place. As for Arsenal, the two goals aside, that was one of their limpest performances of the season. They have good players but they could do with developing a spine. Thanks for reading. Bye. </p>'
