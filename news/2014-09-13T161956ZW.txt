b'West Bromwich Albion 0-2 Everton | Premier League match report'


b'<p>It is easy to see why Alan Irvine has pleaded for time, but patience is already wearing thin at The Hawthorns. A second successive Premier League defeat, marked by two calamitous individual mistakes, was the cue for boos to reverberate at the final whistle, as the West Bromwich Albion supporters vented their anger.</p> <p>An unpopular appointment when he was named as Pepe Mel\xe2\x80\x99s replacement \xe2\x80\x93 and tasked with the considerable job of rebuilding the team after a chaotic summer in which 13 players left and 11 arrived \xe2\x80\x93 Irvine has his work cut out. An already difficult job was made harder still here, after Jonas Olsson and Ben Foster pressed the self-destruct button, gifting Everton both goals.</p> <p>Romelu Lukaku, returning to the club where he enjoyed such a productive season-long loan in 2012-13, scored Everton\xe2\x80\x99s first after only 100 seconds, when he punished Olsson\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful clearance \xe2\x80\x93 the second game running that the Swede has handed the opposition a goal inside two minutes. Kevin Mirallas then grabbed the second, after keeper Foster allowed the winger\xe2\x80\x99s tame shot to slip under his body.</p> <p>Up against the club where he spent three spells \xe2\x80\x93 as a player, assistant manager and academy director \xe2\x80\x93 Irvine knew that he would get no favours. What the Scot could never have imagined, however, was that his players would be such a danger to their own team.</p> <p>Albion huffed and puffed in response to falling behind, but never really looked like recovering once Mirallas had doubled Everton\xe2\x80\x99s lead, on a highly satisfactory afternoon for Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez and his players.</p> <p>Coming into this game on the back of 6-3 home defeat by Chelsea, Everton departed celebrating a first victory of the season, and a much-needed first clean sheet. There was also the sight of Lukaku registering his first goal since his club-record \xc2\xa328m move from Chelsea. It was the striker\xe2\x80\x99s 33rd Premier League goal in all \xe2\x80\x93 but, incredibly, the first time he has scored for a club that owns him.</p> <p>How Albion must wish that the Belgium international was still leading their line. Instead, Irvine was left to reflect on the absence of a cutting edge up front, and the two defining moments in the match, when his players made the sort of errors that any coach or manager is powerless to do anything about.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re talking about two international players \xe2\x80\x93 two proven Premier League players \xe2\x80\x93 and they don\xe2\x80\x99t normally make those kind of mistakes,\xe2\x80\x9d Irvine said. \xe2\x80\x9cFor us to make one, let alone two in the same game, is unusual. The lads are devastated with the goals, but mistakes happen. We just have to accept them and move on.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Asked about the fans\xe2\x80\x99 reaction at the end, Irvine said: \xe2\x80\x9cI understand it. We\xe2\x80\x99re all frustrated, we all came here today hoping that we were going to get a really good performance and a really good result, so I can understand the fans being frustrated and disappointed \xe2\x80\x93 because it\xe2\x80\x99s how I feel as well and it\xe2\x80\x99s how the players feel.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey know that for a fair part of that game they were playing well, and they\xc2\xa0know that individual errors have cost them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As much as Olsson was culpable for the first goal \xe2\x80\x93 when he made a pig\xe2\x80\x99s ear of trying to clear a cross from Leighton Baines \xe2\x80\x93 there was much to admire about the way Lukaku curled a sumptuous shot, from the edge of the area, into the far corner. What followed was not so much a muted celebration as a full-on apology, prompting a round of applause from the Albion supporters.</p> <p>Mart\xc3\xadnez was just delighted to see the ball hit the net. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is only a young man, but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind the [transfer] sum because I knew it was money well spent,\xe2\x80\x9d the Everton manager said.</p> <p>Steven Naismith should have doubled Everton\xe2\x80\x99s lead early in the second half, but he lifted the ball over the bar after Foster had repelled Lukaku\xe2\x80\x99s raking drive. However, it was only a temporary reprieve for Albion. Mirallas, cutting in from the left in the 66th minute, struck a low shot that Foster seemed to have covered \xe2\x80\x93 until he dived over the top of the ball.</p> <p>The Albion keeper did make a couple of fine saves to thwart Leon Osman late on, but, by then, the damage was done.</p>'
