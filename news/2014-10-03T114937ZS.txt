b'Sporting Lisbon president tells of pressure from Marcos Rojo owners'


b'<p>The president of Sporting Lisbon, Bruno de Carvalho, said the club was put under so much pressure to sell Marcos Rojo that the player\xe2\x80\x99s third-party owners turned up to meetings and the directors assumed they were representatives of Manchester United.</p> <p>The Argentina World Cup defender subsequently joined United for \xc2\xa316m, much to De Carvalho\xe2\x80\x99s distress. \xe2\x80\x9cWe did not want Rojo to leave. He was an important player for us,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the BBC World Football Show.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe pressure was so big, they started to speak to the clubs and come here to the meetings,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of the third-party owners.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe directors thought they were people from the clubs because they were speaking in English although they were Portuguese. They believed it was a person from a club but it was a person from the funds.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>United said that it was an issue for Sporting\xe2\x80\x99s president and the third-party group and that the Premier League club had no comment.</p> <p>Similar claims had been made in 2013, when United first attempted to buy the midfielder Ander Herrera from Athletic Bilbao and imposters apparently posing as United representatives attempted to broker the deal.</p> <p>Fifa last week promised to ban third-party ownership within \xe2\x80\x9cthree or four years\xe2\x80\x9d, in the wake of pressure from Uefa and players\xe2\x80\x99 unions to outlaw the practice. Uefa, frustrated with Fifa\xe2\x80\x99s inaction, had vowed to introduce its own ban on third-party ownership if the world governing body refused to act.</p>     The Sporting Lisbon president, Bruno de Carvalho, has been a vocal opponent of third-party ownership.

We don\xe2\x80\x99t know who are the people,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe problem is we created a monster, a monster who started to come to football. Without regulations, they don\xe2\x80\x99t help the club. They only give them one, two, three years of surviving but after that they are dead.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFifa understand people all over the world don\xe2\x80\x99t want that menace in football. They are almost in every club right now. They are breeding all over the clubs.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPeople are very happy to sell a player for \xc2\xa350m, but for the club it is \xc2\xa31m or \xc2\xa32m. And they paid more than that in the salary of one year. Almost all the time you lose money. This is mathematics.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
