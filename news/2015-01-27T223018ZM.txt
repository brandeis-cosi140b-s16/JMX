b'Manchester United need winning run for Champions League, says Juan Mata'


b'<p>Juan Mata believes Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s bid to qualify for the Champions League will be a \xe2\x80\x9cfight to the finish\xe2\x80\x9d, with the Spaniard insisting that his side needs to win all of their remaining 16 matches given the number of clubs that are good enough to finish in the top four.</p> <p>Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s side are currently in fourth place on 40 points and while the gap to second-placed Manchester City, who stand on 47, may prove insurmountable, Southampton on 42, Arsenal on 39, Tottenham Hotspur on 37, West Ham United on 36 and Liverpool on 35, all have realistic chances of securing a Champions League berth.</p> <p>United\xe2\x80\x99s form has dipped recently however, with only one win in their last four Premier League matches. They face Leicester City at home this Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s and Mata believes that the team have to start a winning run . \xe2\x80\x9cIt is going to be a fight until the end and not just between two teams, it will be between three, four, five teams,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is our main objective for this season, to play Champions league football again because I think this club should always play in the Champions League.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very important \xe2\x80\x93 not just to win the games against your big rivals, but also the weaker teams. If you want to be in the top four at the end of the season, you have to win almost every game. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if it\xe2\x80\x99s Leicester City or Manchester City. We have to go into the games trying to win. The next six or seven games are very important to get to a crucial moment in the season.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mata also admitted that it is tough not being in this season\xe2\x80\x99s European Cup. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s difficult, every Tuesday and Wednesday. Watching the games on TV. It\xe2\x80\x99s the thought that we all have in our minds that we need to be back in the Champions League \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s the most attractive competition in the world. We need to be there again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In November and December of last year United won six consecutive league matches and Mata wants to return to that form. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is very important for us to get back on a good run of results like we had,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, adding that it was important to build on their last league win against QPR.</p> <p>Mata has been at United a year now since his \xc2\xa337.1m transfer from Chelsea. Yet he has not always been a first-choice under Van Gaal, having to compete with \xc3\x81ngel Di Mar\xc3\xada, Wayne Rooney, Marouane Fellaini, Ander Herrera, Adnan Januzaj and others for a place, although this, he noted, does not concern him.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI guess it has to be difficult for the manager to choose from all the players we have, especially in attack, but I think it is also good for him because he has so many options,\xe2\x80\x9d Mata said. \xe2\x80\x9cFor me personally, I feel very good, I feel very happy and I\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to keep playing as I did and trying to help the team.</p> <p>The 26-year-old has still managed 20 appearances, however, and is satisfied with his contribution. \xe2\x80\x9cI think you have to look at it after the season has gone, to see how many games I play, to see how important I was for the team. But I feel important and I\xe2\x80\x99ve played a lot of games so far, so I\xe2\x80\x99m happy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>He also had sympathy for his manager who has been questioned recently regarding United\xe2\x80\x99s slow pace of play. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat he is trying is to see the players and put them in the positions for the sake of the team,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mata. \xe2\x80\x9cObviously we have a lot of players and it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for him to figure out how to do it. But we\xe2\x80\x99ve played very good football in some games.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe way the manager wants to play is attractive for the fans and attractive for the players. I really like it \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s just a matter of doing it how he wants.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
