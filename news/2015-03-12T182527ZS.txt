b'<p>Steven Gerrard has defended Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour against Paris Saint-Germain and admitted that all top players are guilty of \xe2\x80\x9cnot abiding by the rules at some time\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>The Liverpool captain was speaking at the launch of an all-star charity match at Anfield alongside Jamie Carragher, who labelled Chelsea attempts to pressure Bjorn Kuipers, the Dutch referee, into dismissing Zlatan Ibrahimovic during their Champions League exit on Wednesday as \xe2\x80\x9cdisgraceful\xe2\x80\x9d. While the former Liverpool team-mates were united in their view of English club\xe2\x80\x99s poor performance in the Champions League this season, Gerrard offered a contrasting take on Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s actions at Stamford Bridge.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s normal at that level,\xe2\x80\x9d the former England captain said. \xe2\x80\x9cPlayers want to win so much, managers want to win so much, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll try every trick in the book to get over the line. We have all been guilty of not abiding by the rules at some time but PSG were the better team on the night and good luck to them going forward.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Carragher claimed Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s gamesmanship was indicative of a Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho team but Gerrard said: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think Mourinho will be interested in whether it tarnishes his legacy or not. Every player has got respect for him and he\xe2\x80\x99ll win more titles as he goes along. He\xe2\x80\x99ll go down as one of the best managers of all time. I\xe2\x80\x99ve only got respect for him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Liverpool captain added: \xe2\x80\x9cIt has not been our year but English clubs will come back. It is not a crisis. The teams will bounce back. Chelsea, City, Arsenal and ourselves will make signings this summer and come back stronger. It has happened before. It is not a major problem but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think English clubs have been good enough this season.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Gerrard and Carragher were at Anfield to publicise a charity game on 29 March in which Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez, Fernando Torres, Xabi Alonso, Dirk Kuyt and Pepe Reina return to their former club, and that will also feature the Chelsea duo John Terry and Didier Drogba. Thierry Henry has confirmed, too.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMany people in John\xe2\x80\x99s position would have turned away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gerrard of his call to the Chelsea captain. \xe2\x80\x9cBut he jumped at the chance to help the charities [Alder Hey children\xe2\x80\x99s hospital and Claire House children\xe2\x80\x99s hospice among them] and to play at Anfield. That shows what kind of man he is. He might get some stick but nothing he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had before.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The 34-year-old has missed Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s last seven matches through injury but confirmed he is fit for Monday\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League visit to Swansea City.</p> <p>Gerrard said: \xe2\x80\x9cI am just over a hamstring injury, I\xe2\x80\x99m fit and available, and I want to leave the club in the top four and go all the way in the FA Cup. That\xe2\x80\x99s how I want to sign off.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
