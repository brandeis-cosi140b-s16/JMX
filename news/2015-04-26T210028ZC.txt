b'Celta Vigo v Real Madrid: La Liga \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened | Michael Butler'


b'<p>Real Madrid march on, and are just two points behind Barcelona at the top of La Liga, but they were lucky here. Both teams\xe2\x80\x99 defending was suicidal, which made for a thrilling game, and a hatful of chances. Ultimately Real\xe2\x80\x99s players showed their quality in finishing those opportunities \xe2\x80\x93 Hernandez in particular \xe2\x80\x93 but Celta can feel aggrieved that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the rub of the green from the referee. </p> <p>Isco didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the best game, but he did whip out a spinning roulette pass to set up Real\xe2\x80\x99s third goal, so at least we can hang our collective hats on that. Thanks for reading, and for your emails and tweets. Bye!</p>'
