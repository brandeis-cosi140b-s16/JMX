b"The Fiver | Joe Hart's enormous, Nike-swaddled finger of blame"


b'<p>THE DERBY\xe2\x80\x99S DONKEYS</p> <p>Having finished second in six of their past eight matches in all competitions, Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s players have meekly acknowledged the Premier League title defence jig is up and said they need to get their act together if they are to even finish on the lowest step of the podium. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s essential to try and finish third,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe Hart, after his team\xe2\x80\x99s monotonously predictable yet slightly weird surrender in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Manchester derby. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get our heads down and win these massive games.\xe2\x80\x9d Echoing \xe2\x80\x93 well, sort of para-echoing \xe2\x80\x93 the words of a compatriot on a similarly doomed title chase last season, the goalkeeper added: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll think about it and we\xe2\x80\x99ll go again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Now regular readers will be painfully aware the Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s no expert on football, but we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought City\xe2\x80\x99s shortcomings should take too much mulling over, before Joe figures out in which direction his enormous, Nike-swaddled finger of blame should be pointing. But in the very unlikely event that Yaya, Samir, Eliaquim, Jes\xc3\xbas and various other curiously unmotivated team-mates of Joe\xe2\x80\x99s are in any way perturbed at being singled out, their recent performances show little in the way of stirring self-defence.</p> <p>Like his manager, Manuel Pellegrini, Joe seems mystified by Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s shortcomings, although they seem fairly obvious to everybody else. In the past week alone, the Fiver has heard respected pundits such as Ray Wilkins, Gary Neville, Graeme Souness, Jamie Carragher, 147 white van drivers, five radio phone-in guests, four calling birds, three French hens, two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree point out that City\xe2\x80\x99s players are clearly overpaid and lacking the appetite for the white-hot \xe2\x80\x93 or in some cases just mildly tepid - cauldron of football battle.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be easier to win games if I knew what was wrong with us but we\xe2\x80\x99ve played well and been unfortunate in some games,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe in his post-match appraisal yesterday, prompting one to wonder how anyone with such a good view of the quite obvious lack of effort being put in by many of the team-mates in front of him could be so apparently deluded.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very difficult to be in fourth place,\xe2\x80\x9d mused Pellegrini. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have difficult teams in the Premier League.\xe2\x80\x9d Two of those difficult teams are Southampton and Liverpool, who are five and seven points behind City respectively, with the Merseyside outfit likely to reduce the gap to four with a win in their game in hand against beleaguered Newcastle this evening. On current form you\xe2\x80\x99d bet your house on City qualifying for European football next season, although the competition in which they\xe2\x80\x99ll feature remains uncertain.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Nick Ames for Liverpool from 7pm BST for MBM coverage of Liverpool 1-0 Newcastle.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to be a soccer player, and I became the best of the best, the number one, better than Maradona, better than Pel\xc3\xa9, and even better than Messi \xe2\x80\x93 but only at night, night time, during my dreams. When I woke up, I realised that I have wooden legs and that I\xe2\x80\x99m doomed to be a writer\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Eduardo Galeano, RIP. </p> FIVER LETTERS      <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
