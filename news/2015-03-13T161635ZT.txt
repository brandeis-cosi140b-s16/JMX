b'The Fiver | The box seat that is 17th'


b'<p>RACE TO THE BOTTOM</p> <p>Life on the fringes. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be all bad. If you finish fourth in the Premier League you still get a shot at Big Cup. Runner-up in the FA Cup and, as Hull and Wigan have found in the past couple of seasons, you still get to play in Europe. And finish 17th in the top division, you still get to play in, er, the top division. But 17th is better than 18th, 19th or 20th and the turmoil as you spin headlong into the Championship. Yes, it is not always exciting to finish 17th but, still, take what you can, when you can.</p> <p>So, who is in the box seat that is 17th place and who is jostling to sit in it? Right now, the team in charge is Aston Villa. Thanks to one league win in a row under Tactics Tim, they are three points and one place ahead of QPR but talk of confidence gathering pace may be slightly premature. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a photo finish and I hope we\xe2\x80\x99re not in it,\xe2\x80\x9d honked Tim knowingly at assorted hacks, tipping his nose and pretending to star in some cut-price betting advert [Hey \xe2\x80\x98Arry! \xe2\x80\x93 Fiver Ed]. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re probably just coming around the corner but it\xe2\x80\x99s probably the longest run-in in racing history. All we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at is the next fence. After that we hope we can stay in the running. There might be a few who fall along the way and we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping that\xe2\x80\x99s not us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Fresh from that barrage, Tiresome Tim could look ahead to Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s trip to the Stadium of Light. Gus Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s men are one place and one point above Villa and might just think 17th will do them. After all, their league form has been nearly as bad as Villa\xe2\x80\x99s: their most recent win was at the end of January against Burnley. They even lost at home to QPR, in the middle of last month. Sunderland are in trouble. Which brings us to QPR. Les Ferdinand has been charged with misconduct, and an FFP judgement is in the offing, and that could be very, very nasty. And they have an away game, of which they have won only one this season, a short derby trip to Selhurst Park. Surely they can tell themselves it is a bit like home and use that as a boost?</p> <p>And this is all before we even bring Burnley into consideration, loitering on the outside looking in, hoping to get a guest invite to safety like Australia in the flamin\xe2\x80\x99 Eurovision Song Contest. They play Manchester City at Turf Moor on Saturday in the late kick-off, by which time, 17th will be in their grasp if Sunderland win and QPR don\xe2\x80\x99t. The race for 17th is on. Do not avert your gaze.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou know the world is a big strange. Maybe because of diet and maybe the quality of the products we are eating, but memories are getting shorter. Because, you know, when Jamie Carragher and Graeme Souness speak about it, it\xe2\x80\x99s because they are having a problem for sure. Jamie stopped playing a couple of years ago and, in two years, he has forgotten everything he did on the pitch. Mr Souness also, but he stopped playing a long time ago. I coached Benfica after he left there so I know a lot about him, so much about him. But I have had a certain kind of education, not just in football but in life, and I prefer to laugh. Envy is the biggest tribute that the shadows do to the man.

I was pleasantly surprised when opening the Fiver yesterday evening; it arrived at tea-time and the letters section was greatly improved from usual. Can this level of competence possibly be sustained, or is this merely the high-water mark that precedes an inevitable decline?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Matt Kersley.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cA free online translation of your Chinese correspondence (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s spam) supplied the following text: \xe2\x80\x98two days interactive training 15 classic case if the staff likened team, middle managers equivalent setter, a good setter, dead ball variable survived ball; setter not in place, the strike also To become Xiuqiu.\xe2\x80\x99 Are you sure this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a ham-fisted Fiver attempt to advertise one of those Big Paper Masterclasses?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Rich Parry.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEmail spam is no laughing matter. I once clicked on a link promising me daily sports-related bon mots that would make me sound more interesting around the office. Instead my inbox was filled with run-on sentences about someone\xe2\x80\x99s $exually-repressed uncle and pictures of John Terry. I had to change email addresses to escape it\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Marcus Ladd.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNice to see a propositional missive from Jaap Stefano (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s spam). Not to over romanticise the heady days of the early millennium internet, but at least having noms de plume such as Aloysius Macbeth, Geraldo Pointdexter and Cleopatra Kissigawa clogging up my junk mail inbox did lend a certain degree of sophistication to my Hotmail account. reasonable_pharmacy14@...\xe2\x80\x99s offer of high-grade medications this morning just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the same cachet\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Nic Finucane.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cTalking of bots, how about \xc3\x81ngel Di Mar\xc3\xada bot?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Steve Allen.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRIP Sir Terry Pratchett (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s last line). A typically superb observation from his novel Unseen Academicals which is ostensibly about a football team: \xe2\x80\x98Pick the teams alternately so one of you ends up with the weird kid and the other with the fat kid.
