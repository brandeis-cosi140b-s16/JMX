b'Fernando Torres agrees to leave Chelsea for Milan on free transfer'


b'<p>Fernando Torres is to have a medical at Milan on Saturday after agreement was reached between the Italian club, Chelsea and the player\xe2\x80\x99s representatives to smooth what is, in effect, a free transfer.</p> <p>The Spain striker, who cost a British record \xc2\xa350m when he signed from Liverpool in January 2011, will leave England after seven seasons in the Premier League and sign a two-year deal at San Siro after agreeing a compromise over his wage demands. He was initially reluctant to lower his \xc2\xa3175,000-a-week salary.</p> <p>Chelsea had been pushing the 30-year-old to make a decision to ensure they had enough time to secure a replacement before Monday\xe2\x80\x99s transfer deadline and moves are being explored for the Queens Park Rangers striker Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my and Roma\xe2\x80\x99s forward Mattia Destro.</p> <p>The latter would cost at least \xc2\xa320m, with the Italian club instinctively resistant to losing a key player so close to the cut-off. R\xc3\xa9my, in contrast, has a buyout clause in his contract set at \xc2\xa38.5m for clubs who finished in the top four last season and is therefore a far simpler option to pursue.</p> <p>Another target, Monaco\xe2\x80\x99s Radamel Falcao, is expected to join Real Madrid on loan for the year. Chelsea are intent on ending the window with three senior forwards and, having sanctioned Torres\xe2\x80\x99s departure, have no option but to re-enter the market.</p> <p>There is no fee involved in the Torres deal and Chelsea describe it as a two-year loan for a player who struggled to justify the record fee that had prised him from Anfield. However, they will take some comfort from saving upwards of \xc2\xa315m in wages over the two years that were remaining on his contract. It is understood he will depart without a pay-off to replace Mario Balotelli at San Siro.</p> <p>There was an admission from Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho that, while Torres has not been unhappy over his three and a half seasons at Chelsea \xe2\x80\x93 he played his part in winning the Champions League and Europa League in that time \xe2\x80\x93 a fresh start may suit a player who would have been third choice at Stamford Bridge.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think a sad person can work the way he does, can be as professional as he is,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe works so hard, is so professional, is so stable in his personal life. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see a sad man. But when I speak about happiness, I mean football happiness. Football feeling: more self-confidence, not the need to feel under pressure, not to feel he has to deliver and that all eyes are on him because of a big transfer fee. All these kind of things.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cProbably the move would create for him a different start. If he wants to leave, it would be because he wants to try a new life. A new club. Probably a new league. To try to be happier than he was in the last couple of years. Chelsea is a very human club in the way the club approaches this kind of situation. Any possibility would be analysed by us as a club and the best decision for him. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think his time here has been sad. He won a few things, scored a few important goals. So I don\xe2\x80\x99t look at this history as being negative.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Yet Torres\xe2\x80\x99s career in south-west London rarely hit the personal heights of his time at Liverpool, most notably under Rafael Ben\xc3\xadtez. Prolific on Merseyside, scoring 65 league goals in 102 appearances, he had arrived at Chelsea feeling the effects of previous knee problems and struggled to adapt to the style of play adopted by successive managers.</p> <p>Arguably the highlight of his time at the club was a dramatic, injury-time equaliser in the Champions League semi-final at Barcelona in 2012 \xe2\x80\x93 he was a late substitute in the final \xe2\x80\x93 though he did score the opener in the Europa League final against Benfica the following year.</p> <p>Chelsea will move swiftly to secure a replacement and, by bringing in another non-homegrown player, will still have to trim one foreigner from their roster. They have 18 in their squad, with 17 permitted under Premier League rules. Marco van Ginkel or Mohamed Salah are the most likely to go on loan.</p> <p>Mourinho said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe thought the market was closed for us but, if Nando opened that market, we would have to go into it again. We would try to make the best possible deal.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll react by buying a foreign striker because I don\xe2\x80\x99t see an English striker in the market that would come to us, or where his club would let him. If we lose a foreign striker, we need another foreign striker.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Destro will remain a long-term target regardless of events over the next 72 hours. Of the Italy international, a youth-team player at Internazionale when Mourinho won the 2010 European Cup, the manager said: \xe2\x80\x9cMattia was a kid when I was at Inter and was playing in our under-21s, training with us so many times. Everyone knew his potential was there to be a top striker. He was unlucky because we had Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Adriano, then Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o and Diego Milito. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a chance because we were full of top strikers.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Torres, who scored only 20 goals in 110 Premier League appearances for Chelsea, has not featured this season and has lost his place in the Spain squad for their games against France and Macedonia next month. He would not have started at Everton on Saturday \xe2\x80\x93 when Chelsea will confront their former forwards Romelu Lukaku and Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o \xe2\x80\x93 despite doubts still surrounding Diego Costa\xe2\x80\x99s ability to begin the game after suffering a slight hamstring injury in training.</p> <p>The Brazil-born striker completed a light training session on Friday and travelled to Merseyside with the squad. Drogba will step in if Costa is deemed not fit enough to start.</p>'
