b'<p>Less than three weeks have passed since Brendan Rodgers said \xe2\x80\x9ccategorically\xe2\x80\x9d that Liverpool would not sign Mario Balotelli. Just a few days earlier, the Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani had stated with \xe2\x80\x9c99.9%\xe2\x80\x9d certainty that the player would stay where he was. In football\xe2\x80\x99s transfer window it is not the boys who cry wolf that fans need to worry about, but the ones who insist nothing is happening at all.</p> <p>Balotelli is not yet a Liverpool player, but all indications are that he may become one very soon. Negotiations between the Premier League club and Milan were progressing on Thursday afternoon, and the striker told Sky Italia that it had been his final day training with the Rossoneri.</p> <p>Perhaps we ought to have seen this one coming. Galliani made an identical estimation regarding the futures of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Thiago Silva in the summer of 2012, just days before selling both players to Paris Saint-Germain. Six months later, he told reporters that there was a 99.5% chance that he would fall short in his attempts to sign Balotelli from Manchester City.</p> <p>If anyone believed his claim about the same player\xe2\x80\x99s future this summer, it was only because the list of potential suitors appeared to be so short. Balotelli\xe2\x80\x99s agent, Mino Raiola, told reporters that there were eight to 10 clubs in the world who could afford his client. He singled out Arsenal as one of them, only for the Gunners to sign Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez instead.</p> <p>Europe\xe2\x80\x99s richest clubs seemed to have different targets in mind. Chelsea, Barcelona, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich all reinforced their attacks without turning Balotelli\xe2\x80\x99s way. Liverpool had both the funds and a vacancy up front after selling Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez, but Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99s denial seemed to have taken them out the running.</p> <p>Milan are reported to be seeking just \xc2\xa316m for Balotelli \xe2\x80\x93 barely \xc2\xa34m more than Southampton paid for Shane Long. For a 24-year-old striker with 33 Italy caps and 31 Champions League appearances under his belt, that seems like an absolute steal.</p> <p>Then again, Milan\xe2\x80\x99s supporters thought much the same thing when Balotelli joined their club from City for a similar fee back in 2013. The transfer was described at the time as one of Galliani\xe2\x80\x99s greatest coups, going some way toward healing the wounds caused by the sales of Ibrahimovic and Silva.</p> <p>For four months Balotelli was brilliant \xe2\x80\x93 scoring twice on his debut and 10 more times over the next 12 games as he dragged a struggling Milan side back into the Champions League places. Playing for the club he had supported as a boy, he seemed to be in his element.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m home,\xe2\x80\x9d he said during an interview with Sports Illustrated over the summer. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m usually with my family. I\xe2\x80\x99m relaxed. My friends, they can come. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like in Manchester.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The moment would not last. Milan made a miserable start to the 2013-14 season, winning just four of their first 17 games. Balotelli missed the first penalty of his career during a defeat to Napoli in September, before scoring a spectacular consolation goal and then getting himself sent off for dissent.</p> <p>It was a match that set a tone for his whole season. Balotelli went on to score 14 times in 30 games for Milan \xe2\x80\x93 a respectable return by most players\xe2\x80\x99 standards \xe2\x80\x93 but struggled to keep a lid on his emotions. He missed another penalty two months later, this one pushed tamely down the middle at Genoa\xe2\x80\x99s Mattia Perin, and racked up nine yellow cards by the end of the season.</p> <p>After coaching Su\xc3\xa1rez through the last two extraordinary seasons, Rodgers might feel confident in his ability to work with a gifted striker weighed down by a tempestuous personality. Both players featured in France Football\xe2\x80\x99s list of the sport\xe2\x80\x99s 50 greatest bad boys published in February this year.</p> <p>But the manager would do well to recognise the differences between the two. Su\xc3\xa1rez, for all his obvious faults, is a ferocious competitor whose worst indiscretions have typically been motivated by a desire to gain an on-field advantage over an opponent \xe2\x80\x93 through any means necessary. Rarely could he be accused of drifting through games as Balotelli did often for Milan last season, allowing himself to be overwhelmed by frustration at decisions that went against him.</p> <p>On the other hand there are good reasons to believe that a change of scenery may do the latter player some good. The weight of expectation on Balotelli in Italy has been extraordinary, and not just in footballing terms.</p> <p>From the moment he burst on to the scene as a teenager he has been held up as the face of a new multicultural Italy \xe2\x80\x93 a figurehead in a battle against racism so endemic that the incoming head of the Italian Football Federation thought it appropriate this summer to allegedly make an off-hand remark about \xe2\x80\x9cbanana-eaters\xe2\x80\x9d flooding the league.</p> <p>Even that is only the tip of the iceberg. When Italy travelled to play a friendly on a pitch reclaimed from the Camorra last year, Balotelli was heralded in some papers as a figurehead against organised crime. When he objected to that label on Twitter \xe2\x80\x93 stating that he was only out to prove that \xe2\x80\x9csoccer is wonderful\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 a number of commentators rounded on him, accusing him of speaking irresponsibly.</p> <p>In Liverpool, Balotelli has an opportunity to get back to being a footballer and nothing more. The question is whether he will take it.</p>'
