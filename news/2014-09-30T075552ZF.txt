b'Football transfer rumours: Manchester United to move for Seamus Coleman?'


b'<p>Olivier Giroud turns 28 today and can celebrate his birthday with a new contract from Arsenal and, perhaps, some timeless wisdom from Rumi, the Persian mystic and poet who was born on the same day nearly 750 years ago. So perhaps as the Frenchman nurses his foot injury, he will reflect on Rumi\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that: \xe2\x80\x9cSuffering is a gift. In it is hidden mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>That sounds like swill to the Mill but people won\xe2\x80\x99t be quoting the Mill in 750 years time so what do we know? Here, let\xe2\x80\x99s have some more insight from the learned Rumi: \xe2\x80\x9cEither give me more wine or leave me alone.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s more like it! We go again: \xe2\x80\x9cStop being so small; you are the universe in ecstatic motion.\xe2\x80\x9d Yay, the wine is working! Onwards with the Mill.</p> <p>Cristiano Ronaldo could return to Manchester United in two years blah blah blah blah. Forget that, let\xe2\x80\x99s have some more Rumi: \xe2\x80\x9cSit. Be still. And listen, because you\xe2\x80\x99re drunk and we are at the edge of the roof.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s almost like he\xe2\x80\x99s watching us. Now sit, be still and listen: because Louis van Gaal has had another brainwave. Funnily enough, it\xe2\x80\x99s one that David Moyes also had but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t enact: sign Seamus Coleman. Why would Everton agree to that? Because Manchester United will offer them tens of millions of pounds. Plus Marouane Fellaini. Oh.</p> <p>Chelsea are reported to want Coleman too, presumably because they only have two world-class right-backs at the moment. Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho is also running the rule over Benfica\xe2\x80\x99s 20-year-old midfielder Anderson Talisca, who may or may not respond by repeating Rumi\xe2\x80\x99s most famous utterance: \xe2\x80\x9cDo not cast thy glance upon my golden face, for I have iron legs.\xe2\x80\x9d Even the Special One would struggle to find a comeback for that.</p> <p>Perhaps Ross Barkley may make a similar declaration when Chelsea come calling \xe2\x80\x93 intoning, for instance, that \xe2\x80\x9cmaybe you are searching among the branches for what only appears in the roots\xe2\x80\x9d. But word is Everton will not even answer the door unless the Londoners bring at least \xc2\xa350m with them.</p> <p>Juventus want to gaffer tape Paul Pogba to the club by getting him to sign a new contract that will keep him in Turin until 2019 and triple his salary, while Aston Villa, Sunderland and Everton are among several clubs who like the look of Sampdoria\xe2\x80\x99s 22-year-old striker Manolo Gabbiadini.</p> <p>Finally, the further Simon Mignolet falls from perfection, the closer Liverpool get to giving free agent V\xc3\xadctor Vald\xc3\xa9s everything he wants. \xe2\x80\x9cEach has to enter the nest made by the other imperfect bird,\xe2\x80\x9d Brendan Rodgers might explain. And there ends today\xe2\x80\x99s Rumi Mill.</p>'
