b'Brendan Rodgers: Daniel Sturridge out of Real Madrid and Chelsea games'


b'<p>Brendan Rodgers expects Daniel Sturridge to miss Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s most demanding week of the season as they play Newcastle United, Real Madrid and Chelsea in quick succession.</p> <p>Sturridge has not featured for Liverpool since 31 August because of a thigh injury suffered on England duty plus a calf strain sustained before his first full training session back with the club.</p> <p>The Liverpool manager initially estimated that the striker\xe2\x80\x99s latest absence would last about \xe2\x80\x9ctwo to four weeks\xe2\x80\x9d but a fortnight on, and perhaps unsurprisingly given Sturridge\xe2\x80\x99s fitness record, he believes there is little prospect of a rapid return.</p> <p>Liverpool travel to a rejuvenated Newcastle on Saturday before facing Real Madrid in their Champions League return at the Bernab\xc3\xa9u on Tuesday. The unbeaten Premier League leaders, Chelsea, visit Anfield on Saturday week but Rodgers is preparing for all three games without his leading striker.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think he will be fit,\xe2\x80\x9d said the manager in relation to the next three matches. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will work with him and hopefully we will get that bit of luck when he comes back. When he comes back hopefully we will have him for the rest of the season. When you have that talent you just have to keep yourself as fit and available as you possibly can.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Rodgers appeared bemused by Sturridge\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion during an interview with Talksport on Wednesday that his frequent muscle-injury problems may be hereditary. \xe2\x80\x9cI can only concentrate on his injury now and what my medical team here, who are fantastic, are telling me,\xe2\x80\x9d the manager said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe is just in the middle of recovering and we will see the length of time it takes. I\xe2\x80\x99m not an expert on genetics or medicine, so I can\xe2\x80\x99t comment. All we know is that he had a calf strain on the back of his last injury, and he is working to recover from that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Asked whether Sturridge\xe2\x80\x99s absences could be psychological as well as physical, Rodgers replied: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is probably speaking how he felt. That is the way of the world. The bottom line is that he is injured. He strained his calf. So he is injured. We will just wait and work with him until he gets back fit.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Liverpool have struggled for form during Sturridge\xe2\x80\x99s lay-off and Mario Balotelli\xe2\x80\x99s 86th-minute equaliser against Swansea City in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday was their first goal in three matches at Anfield. \xe2\x80\x9cGradually, as each day goes by, I sense we are getting better,\xe2\x80\x9d Rodgers said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWith Daniel out, of course it is a miss, but it is also an opportunity, as we saw the other night. Fabio Borini was excellent, a real threat, and put in a wonderful cross for Mario\xe2\x80\x99s goal. And Rickie Lambert, who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t had many opportunities, his goals will come. He is working tirelessly every day, he had some nice touches and his goals will come.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
