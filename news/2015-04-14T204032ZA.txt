b'Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid v Real Madrid: Champions League quarter-final \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>And so, after an engrossing encounter at the Vicente Calderon, thoughts turn to next Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s second leg at the Bernabeu. The tie is in the balance. Real Madrid will back themselves to get the win they need, but a score draw will do for Atletico. Their record at the Bernabeu this season? A 1-1 draw, a 2-2 draw, a 2-1 win. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be confident. Will Real regret not making the most of their first-half dominance tonight? You\xe2\x80\x99ll just have to wait and see. Thanks for reading and emailing. I\xe2\x80\x99m off to cry about my stricken phone. Bye. We\xe2\x80\x99ll leave the final word to Jezz Dresner. \xe2\x80\x9cJezz called no goals,\xe2\x80\x9d he third-persons. \xe2\x80\x9cCalled in on 17 minutes! Nice one.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Applause all round from the home players and supporters. Photograph: Alberto Martin/EPA  '
