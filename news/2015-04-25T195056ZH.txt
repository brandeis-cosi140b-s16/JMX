b'How Watford went from the ridiculous to the sublime \xe2\x80\xa6 to the top flight | Simon Burnton'


b'<p>In many ways there could have been no more fitting opponents than Brighton to usher Watford towards promotion. Their previous meeting, at Vicarage Road in October, represents a watershed in a season that, at that stage, seemed as likely to end in ridicule as in rejoicing. Results had been reasonable enough \xe2\x80\x93 the 1-1 draw lifted the Hornets to second in the table \xe2\x80\x93 but off the pitch there was turmoil: they were already on their third manager of the season and about to replace him with a fourth.</p> <p>The first, Beppe Sannino, resigned in August amid reports of player unrest; his replacement, \xc3\x93scar Garc\xc3\xada, quit for health reasons after four weeks; and Billy McKinlay took four points from two games before, without so much as glimpsing a contract, he was elbowed aside in favour of the former Chelsea midfielder Slavisa Jokanovic. The decision, taken three days after that Brighton game, seemed brutal and graceless at the time but hindsight has painted it in a different light; Watford were second then and are first now but their improvement as a team has been dramatic.</p> <p>To judge entirely on results, the key appointment followed some time later. Jokanovic, who despite the 18 months he spent in London towards the end of his playing career speaks in halting, uncertain English, retained the two Spanish assistant coaches brought in by Garc\xc3\xada but felt another recruit was necessary. \xe2\x80\x9cI need an English coach,\xe2\x80\x9d Jokanovic said in December, his first eight games having yielded four defeats and just two wins. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are in England and there are many foreign coaches on my staff. I need a native English voice in training if something isn\xe2\x80\x99t 100% clear. It will help us have better communication with my team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>On 15 January, Dean Austin, the former Spurs defender who started his career in Watford\xe2\x80\x99s youth system and had been Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 assistant at Vicarage Road, returned. Praising the \xe2\x80\x9cphenomenal amount of talent\xe2\x80\x9d in the squad, he said the priority was \xe2\x80\x9cto make sure we keep that level of consistency\xe2\x80\x9d. They have done so in the most emphatic fashion.</p> <p>Much has been made of Watford\xe2\x80\x99s poor record against the other promotion-chasing sides \xe2\x80\x93 they have earned just 13 points against the rest of the Championship\xe2\x80\x99s top eight, while Middlesbrough top that mini-league with 26, Norwich have 24 and Bournemouth 21. But the flipside of that coin is their remorselessness against the other 16 teams in the division. hey have taken, on average, 2.4 points from each of these games \xe2\x80\x93 scoring 2.5 goals and conceding 0.6 \xe2\x80\x93 compared with 2.1 for Bournemouth and 1.9 for Norwich and Middlesbrough. Since Austin\xe2\x80\x99s appointment, they have played 13 times against the bottom 16 and won them all. Watford have proved that a handful of so-called six pointers are of little meaning when there is complete consistency elsewhere.</p> <p>In the Premier League, of course, it is not enough to be good only when playing teams who are not. It is true that behind their bad record against the top sides lies a string of unusual mitigating circumstances \xe2\x80\x93 including sendings\xe2\x80\x91off after 25 seconds at Bournemouth (later rescinded) and three minutes at Norwich \xe2\x80\x93 but this Watford side are not quite as dynamic flowing forward as Bournemouth, nor as resolute in defence as Middlesbrough.</p> <p>What they do possess is a surfeit of technical midfielders, an in-form goalkeeper in Heurelho Gomes, three outstanding strikers and a manager with an uncanny knack of getting substitutions right. \xe2\x80\x9cI think the Premier League would suit our style of play,\xe2\x80\x9d the Swiss midfielder Almen Abdi said recently. \xe2\x80\x9cWe like to keep the ball on the floor and play football. Sometimes this is hard with some of the teams you face in the Championship who like to play long ball.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Troy Deeney has become the first Watford player to score 20 or more goals in three successive seasons but if his excellence is reliable, his strike partner Odion Ighalo is simply on the hottest streak of his career. Between the start of the season and Boxing Day, the Nigerian scored three league goals in 16 appearances, many of them as a substitute, a similar strike rate to that he had achieved when scoring 21 goals in 103 matches for his previous club, Granada. Since Boxing Day, the 25-year-old has scored 17 in 18 games (Cristiano Ronaldo has a comparatively disappointing 18 in 22 in the same period) and, though he can look clumsy at times, Ighalo is also capable of scoring goals of great power, as he did against Middlesbrough earlier in the month, and of great finesse, as against Derby three days earlier. Their third striker, Matej Vydra, on loan from Udinese, has scored 15.</p> <p>Watford\xe2\x80\x99s last promotion challenge, under Gianfranco Zola two years ago, was controversially fuelled by a large influx of loanees. This season, there are relatively few \xe2\x80\x93 Watford manipulate the permanent transfer market instead these days \xe2\x80\x93 but some have been influential. Adl\xc3\xa8ne Guedioura has shone in his 13 appearances across two spells on loan from Crystal Palace, providing a goal threat as well as key assists against Wigan from the left flank, and against Derby from the right. Watford have won 77% of their games with the Algerian midfielder in the side and lost just one. In re-signing him on a three-month emergency loan in February, Jokanovic took a calculated gamble: the player would be forced to return to his parent club with one game of the season remaining, potentially destabilising the\xc2\xa0side for the play-offs. As it turned out, he has helped them avoid the play\xe2\x80\x91offs altogether.</p> <p>Another loan signing, Matthew Connolly, stands on the verge of an unusual achievement: the defender was at QPR when they won the Championship title in 2011, at Reading when they followed them in 2012, and at Cardiff when they did it in 2013. He has brought defensive cover and title-chasing nous, and though he has played only three times since his arrival in March Watford increasingly seem likely to profit from the uniquely intimate relationship between their totem and this trophy.</p>'
