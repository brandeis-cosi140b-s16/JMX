b'MR LIVERPOOL <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve asked a number of people and I\xe2\x80\x99ve asked a lot of my staff if they could describe Steven in one word, what would it be?\xe2\x80\x9d journalists were told today by Brendan Rodgers, who has rarely been known to use one word when 800 will do. \xe2\x80\x9cI heard all the words you will have heard before, words that come to mind in terms of being genuine, quality and world class, all the adjectives you would describe him with,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Rodgers before announcing that he himself \xe2\x80\x93 not his staff, not any hack and certainly not Rafa blummin\xe2\x80\x99 Ben\xc3\xadtez \xe2\x80\x93 is the best man to capture $tevie Mbe in a nutshell (suit).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFor me, the word I would describe him with is \xe2\x80\x98Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rodgers of the man about to relocate to Los Angeles. \xe2\x80\x9cNot just Liverpool as a football club or Liverpool and the supporters but Liverpool the city ... What he has given to this city, politicians haven\xe2\x80\x99t given to this city. Local hospitals, the charities, all the work he does, it\xe2\x80\x99s unheralded,\xe2\x80\x9d heralded Rodgers, as certain London-based football fans also called for continued recognition of the generous donation that Gerrard once made to Demba Ba.</p> <p>Characteristically, Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 effusive eulogy collapsed just short of its intended goal, as the manager dissolved into a pool of hot tears before he could get so far as calling for Elton John, or maybe Cilla Black, to pen a farewell song before the player\xe2\x80\x99s final competitive appearance at Anfield tomorrow. Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 last audible words before prolonged banshee wails were: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a wonderful symbol for the people here and an incredible, incredible icon for the club.\xe2\x80\x9d </p> <p>Tomorrow, as all around him break down, it will, as so often, be up to the lion-hearted legend himself to lead by example. By Sami Hyypia\xe2\x80\x99s example, to be precise. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember Sami Hyypia cried after his last game,\xe2\x80\x9d interjected Gerrard. \xe2\x80\x9cSami was a big, tough centre-half but definitely had an emotional side. I have, too, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anything to be ashamed of if you shed a tear, especially if you have a love and affection for the supporters.\xe2\x80\x9d Hankie vendors of the world, get yourselves over to Anfield tomorrow to make a quick buck. </p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Paul Doyle from 7.45pm BST for minute-by-minute coverage of Middlesbrough 2-0 Brentford (agg 4-1).</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe are talking about the most beautiful sport and most passionate in the world and it\xe2\x80\x99s been directed by a freezer, someone who should live in a block of ice. I only ask God, and my mum that is in heaven, that I can have the opportunity to get this man out of Fifa and give the people what they deserve\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Diego Maradona, who is backing Prince Ali Bin al-Hussein to become Fifa president, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hold back when asked what he thinks of Uncle Sepp. </p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: solid gold bedding (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver). May I be the first of doubtless 1,057 pedants to point out that while it\xe2\x80\x99s true a solid gold duvet would generate no warmth, neither do most normal duvets. They act as insulation allowing the heat generated by the person(s) underneath to be retained, but unless they\xe2\x80\x99ve been set on fire they aren\xe2\x80\x99t actually a source of heat themselves\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 James Kirk.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLet me rebut The Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that Florentino P\xc3\xa9rez\xe2\x80\x99s duvet should generate warmth, rather than simply insulate the warmth he generates from easily dissipating away from him. True, with a quite high thermal conductivity of around 318 W.m^-1.K^-1, solid gold is far worse a choice for a winter duvet then a standard peasant filling like polyester (around 0.5 W.m^-1.K^-1 or less). But if he did want a crazy-rich-person-nonsense duvet that also kept him warm, given that a prime chemical ingredient in hair gel, PVP, has a thermal conductivity below 0.5 W.m^-1.K^-1,* I would suggest The Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s hypothetical P\xc3\xa9rez instead bring some shears down to the Bernab\xc3\xa9u and proceed to stuff his duvet with the glistening locks of Him\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Mehrun Etebari.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was confused when I read that Spurs keeper Brad Friedel, 93, will retire (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Bits and Bobs). Then I read the article and worked it out. He had 310 consecutive starts, by 43 years of age, in 23 seasons, earning 82 USA! USA!! USA!!! caps, retiring at 44 years of age, playing for five clubs, having started at 20 years of age. 310-43-23-82-44-5-20=93.
