b"Sporting Kansas City's Dom Dwyer: a selfie portrait of unlikely MLS success"


b'<p>In order to make a mark on his or her profession, a sports star must reach a number of stages. Some are essential to the trade; others are rites of passage; others are products of the age and culture in which he or she lives and works.</p> <p>For many, it is a sequence of success and a progression of performance, plus a little light relief (see Balotelli, Mario). Add a growing reputation on the field to an increasing profile off it, and you have the semblance of a sporting phenomenon. </p> <p>In the case at hand, we might consider a checklist of such stages and achievements: </p>  <li>Career-threatening injury at a young age: check</li> <li>Leap of faith while still a teenager: check</li> <li>Ending up in a backwater you didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know existed: check</li> <li>Battling back to national prominence: check</li> <li>Absorption into a foreign sporting culture: check</li> <li>Ending up in another backwater: check</li> <li>Battling back to national prominence, again: check</li> <li>Creating social-media notoriety: check</li> <li>Wonderfully over-the-top scoring celebration: check</li> <li>Creating a debate over international allegiance: \xe2\x80\xa6 that\xe2\x80\x99s next on the list.</li>  <p>Welcome to the world of Dom Dwyer, the Sporting Kansas City striker and bundle of energy who has been stretching nets and fraying tempers on a tour of MLS defences in which he is threatening to break his team\xe2\x80\x99s single-season scoring record. The combative 24-year-old has scored 17 goals in 26 appearances for the champions, to sit one behind the 1996 season mark of Preki Radosavljevic with eight league games to go.</p> <p>It has been a season pocked with incidents that have helped to single Dwyer out as someone who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mind ruffling a few feathers \xe2\x80\x93 notably an April Twitter spat with Nick Rimando of Real Salt Lake, a team the SKC hitman professes to \xe2\x80\x9chate\xe2\x80\x9d, and a controversial yellow card against Chicago in July, shown after a goal for a now infamous \xe2\x80\x9cselfie celebration\xe2\x80\x9d:</p>    <p>Let me take a selfie. #SportingKC pic.twitter.com/Uy0p6Ep21u</p>&mdash; Sporting Kansas City (@SportingKC) July 6, 2014    <p>Yet talk to the player himself and there\xe2\x80\x99s no trace of anything wayward or self-seeking. If anything, Dwyer is a \xe2\x80\x9cyoung\xe2\x80\x9d 24, having lost several years of his youth to injuries. This is, after all, his first full year in Major League Soccer. </p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to be at the highest level I can,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what that is yet and feel there\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot more I can do. People keep telling me I am playing well, yet I don\xe2\x80\x99t really feel I\xe2\x80\x99m doing that just yet.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>For someone who is \xe2\x80\x9cnot doing that well yet\xe2\x80\x9d, Dwyer has earned a remarkable profile in a season which started with a winner in KC\xe2\x80\x99s third game, at San Jose. He tends to score in bunches \xe2\x80\x93 he has scored twice five times and once seven \xe2\x80\x93 and though he enjoyed a marvellous May, with six goals in seven games, since mid-July the pickings have been slim, with just three in eight.</p> <p>He has inspired both fan loyalty, notably when his omission from the MLS All Star roster in July produced howls of protest from Sporting fans \xe2\x80\x93 he was subsequently called up for the win over Bayern Munich \xe2\x80\x93 and fan displeasure, if the Twitter account @DwyerH8sScoring is anything to go by. He is not swayed by either.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI keep learning with every game and feel I can improve with every game,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter every game I want to come back and work on things, talk to the coaches and find out what they think I can do better. I\xe2\x80\x99m still working on a lot of things in training and sometimes the coaches tell me not to do so much, but there is so much I want to do.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>That is a fitting summary of Dwyer\xe2\x80\x99s career to date, underlining as it does the yawning gap in his CV regarding the early years in which he would normally have absorbed a lot of tactical acumen. Dwyer\xe2\x80\x99s is an odd case, of a player arriving in the right place by the wrong route at an unlikely time.</p> \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to say no when someone hands you a dream\xe2\x80\x99     Dom Dwyer goes up for a header against the Montreal Impact. Photograph: Jasen Vinlove/USA Today Sports    <p>Many players can be nomads, but few have taken such a circuitous journey as Dwyer. He has, so far, experienced the English youth system, the attentions of a Scottish talent scout, a two-part American college life and a three-stage professional journey which has included a \xe2\x80\x9cdemotion\xe2\x80\x9d to the USL Pro League and a rocket-like return.</p> <p>It is all a far cry from his birthplace, the Sussex village of Cuckfield, from which the last major sportsman to emerge was James Cook, who played for Brighton and Hove Albion and England in 1925. From there, Dwyer has branched out.</p> <p>His first obstacle arose after a family move to Norfolk and a spell in Norwich City\xe2\x80\x99s youth set-up: a persistent metatarsal injury led to medical advice that he should quit playing \xe2\x80\x93 at 16. Dwyer was lucky enough to get a second opinion from a British Olympic Association physiotherapist, who advised a year\xe2\x80\x99s rest and lots of patience. </p> <p>That is not typically part of most teenagers\xe2\x80\x99 DNA but in this case patience paid \xe2\x80\x93 Dwyer\xe2\x80\x99s next appointment was with the former Falkirk and Chelsea defender Joe McLaughlin and his Soccer Icon USA company, which offers trials and assistance for kids interested in college soccer in America.</p> <p>Dwyer and two friends landed a trial in London. They were all taken off after only 10 minutes. Dwyer says: \xe2\x80\x9cWe were basically told: \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen enough. Where do you want to go?\xe2\x80\x99 And we just decided to go for it. I guess we didn\xe2\x80\x99t know much about the US college set-up but we thought it would be fun.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Which is how Dwyer and his pals ended up at little Tyler Junior College, an hour south-east of Dallas. Two national championships followed, along with a whopping 37 goals in his sophomore year. A bigger college, the University of South Florida, came calling.</p> <p>Dwyer recalls: \xe2\x80\x9cMy plan was always to play a couple of years, get my degree and then go back to England and see what turned up.\xe2\x80\x9d What did turn up was an offer, just six months later, to sign a general contract with Major League Soccer. Dwyer turned it down. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t what I wanted at the time,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cand the contract was non-negotiable, which didn\xe2\x80\x99t sit right with me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The league came back with an improved offer and this time Dwyer\xe2\x80\x99s head was turned, despite his English sensibilities railing at this \xe2\x80\x9cforeign\xe2\x80\x9d way of doing things: </p>  <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to say no when someone is offering to hand you a dream, but the system \xe2\x80\x93 the player combine, the draft \xe2\x80\x93 is so hard to get your head around when it\xe2\x80\x99s not something you\xe2\x80\x99re used to.</p>  <p>The 2012 MLS draft was held in Kansas City and the 21-year-old from rural Sussex was picked 16th \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cI was the only player to get a cheer when my selection was announced!\xe2\x80\x9d He had been integrated into a thoroughly American sporting system.</p> <p>His first season went past in a blur of reserve games; a strong 2013 preseason had him prepared for bigger things, until told he was being loaned out to Orlando City in the USL Pro League. </p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t too pleased at first because it seemed like a big step back,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cbut head coach Peter Vermes basically told me, \xe2\x80\x98If you can\xe2\x80\x99t show me you can score goals there, how can I trust you to do it for us?\xe2\x80\x99 So I said I\xe2\x80\x99d give it a try.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In less than half a season in Orlando Dwyer scored 15 goals, including one in a prestige friendly against the Brazilian side Fluminense. He was then recalled to a Sporting squad who were making big strides themselves; then came a surprise recall to Orlando for their championship game on 7 September, an 11-goal bonanza in front of more than 20,000 fans at the Citrus Bowl, the Englishman netting four times in a 7-4 win over the Charlotte Eagles.</p> <p>Dwyer says: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a great experience for me and I learned so much, especially from Orlando head coach Adrian Heath. I needed games to really find my feet and I managed to score goals almost every time I played. That\xe2\x80\x99s something I pride myself on. I want to be scoring goals and giving my team a lift.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Sporting KC subsequently made it a two-title season for Dwyer, as they marched through the MLS play-offs, with the recently-returned striker netting the winner in the Eastern Conference Final against Houston \xe2\x80\x93 and this season he has continued the goal spree. This sets up his next potential dilemma: is he English or American?</p> Model citizen?     Dwyer shoots against Toronto FC. Photograph: Peter Llewellyn/USA Today Sports    <p>While the USA performed admirably in Brazil this summer, reaching the second round, the one area of the game in which they remain thin is reliable goal-scoring. Dwyer\xe2\x80\x99s form has therefore pushed him into an intriguing conversation you can be sure head coach J\xc3\xbcrgen Klinsmann has heard. Dwyer says: </p>  <p>As much love as I have for the US, I am very much English. I lived there for 18 years of my life and all of my family are still there. I will be going back to spend Christmas with them and they would love for me to go back and play there. But, at the same time, they really want what\xe2\x80\x99s best for me and they know I am happy here. Would England even look this way for a striker? That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty big ask.</p>  <p>His \xe2\x80\x98Englishness\xe2\x80\x99 hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped him applying for US citizenship, a fact SKC chief executive Robb Heineman unexpectedly made public in July, and Dwyer would become USA-eligible in January 2017 \xe2\x80\x93 in time for qualifying for the 2018 World Cup. </p> <p>He admits: \xe2\x80\x9cOnce it came out and there was so much positive feedback, it got me excited. My team-mates Graham Zusi and Matt Besler have told me how great it would be and how much I\xe2\x80\x99d love it. I think the US has a fantastic thing going on and it would be an honour to be called up.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Sporting\xe2\x80\x99s head coach, Vermes, insists is still too early to see an international career for Dwyer. But he has seen enough to make several judgments. He says: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are several types of player, some who are made for great things early on, others who work at it over a long career and others who make you think, \xe2\x80\x98Where the hell did he come from?\xe2\x80\x99 Dom is in that third category.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDoes he have the potential to go a long way? Absolutely. But we have seen plenty of players in the past with incredible potential fail to live up to it. Dom still has some growth needed in parts of his game and there are other pieces that need to get better but what you want to see as a coach is the hunger and desire to improve.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDom definitely has that character, passion and work ethic and that\xe2\x80\x99s the most pleasing thing. He has a good perspective and is very honest with himself. He\xe2\x80\x99s not going to get caught up in the bullshit and think he\xe2\x80\x99s better than he is before he is. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a rare attitude to have. Applied to his talent, it could certainly take him a long way.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>All the way to Russia with the USA?</p>'
