b'Why always him? What made Rodgers turn to Mario Balotelli at Chelsea? | Andy Hunter'


b'<p>With all eyes on Diego Costa and where he stamps his feet following Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s fractious Capital Cup semi-final win over Liverpool, the other striker who left an unfortunate mark at Stamford Bridge was relegated to a footnote. Fitting, for that is how Mario Balotelli\xe2\x80\x99s Liverpool career is playing out.</p> <p>Sky\xe2\x80\x99s commentary team heralded Balotelli\xe2\x80\x99s 70th-minute introduction for Lazar Markovic as a chance to put one over the former Internazionale coach who labelled him \xe2\x80\x9cunmanageable\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho. Ultimately, his contribution amounted to no more than weakening a previously impressive, dangerous Liverpool performance and unwittingly assisting in Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s winning goal.</p> <p>Not all substitutions succeed and not all the blame for Branislav Ivanovic\xe2\x80\x99s header belongs to Balotelli. It was his poor pass to Eden Hazard that forced Lucas Leiva to concede the decisive free-kick, and sail close to a second yellow card in the process, but a poorly organised defence cost Liverpool as much as the striker\xe2\x80\x99s failure to track Ivanovic once Costa ran into his space. A wild shot over Thibaut Courtois\xe2\x80\x99s goal, admittedly after a slight bobble, and a selfish attempt to find the top corner from an improbable angle were also typical of a Liverpool career that started ineffectively and has gone steadily downhill.</p> <p>What did surprise, however, was the level of faith Brendan Rodgers showed at a critical stage in a striker so unsuited to his team, a damning assessment that was delivered by the Liverpool manager himself following Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup fourth-round tie against Bolton Wanderers.</p> <p>Balotelli, with two goals in 19 appearances for Liverpool (eight as substitute), was not included in the 18-man squad for the goalless draw with Bolton. Three days later he was selected for a place on the bench over Fabio Borini, who squandered decent chances against Neil Lennon\xe2\x80\x99s team but at least enlivened the overall display, then introduced instead of Adam Lallana and before Rickie Lambert. One can only imagine Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s thought process as a fellow striker with more natural talent but without the same application gets the nod before him once again.</p> <p>The 24-year-old cannot play his way into form or favour sat in the stands, true, but Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 withering critique of Balotelli post-Bolton suggested his \xe2\x80\x9ccalculated risk\xe2\x80\x9d on the striker had run its course. It was not the first time Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s manager had explained why Balotelli does not fit into his plans, and again revived the question of why he was acquired for \xc2\xa316m in the first place, but his latest offering was relatively unprompted. Tuesday provided a contradiction.</p> <p>Rodgers had said on Saturday: \xe2\x80\x9cMario is the same as any other player, there is no special treatment for anyone. Fabio and Rickie have been working tirelessly in training and have contributed when they\xe2\x80\x99ve come on.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI had a good chat with Mario for an hour or so yesterday [Friday] and he knows what\xe2\x80\x99s required to be in this team. It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for him. He knows the level of this team, the pressing and the aggression that you need. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t do that then you are not going to be part of what this team is trying to achieve.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe suffered in the first part of the season and we can\xe2\x80\x99t go back to that. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter who the player is or how much he was bought for, it is about the team. If you want to contribute you have to be \xe2\x80\x98at it\xe2\x80\x99 every day in training. Mario is a box player but much more is asked of the team. I\xe2\x80\x99m confident he will respond.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The cynical theory that Balotelli was put in the shop window against Chelsea does not apply. There is an acceptance the forward will not be sold this month and that was reinforced before the semi-final by his agent, Mino Raiola, who confirmed Balotelli\xe2\x80\x99s future will be reassessed at the end of the season. \xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask to leave. It is too early, with the injury, to say we leave in January,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are no big problems. He\xe2\x80\x99s adapting to a new style that the manager wants. We\xe2\x80\x99ll see in the summer.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Perhaps Rodgers trusted that Balotelli\xe2\x80\x99s natural ability would finally deliver for Liverpool, as he did last summer when weighing up whether to sign a player renowned more for his antics off the pitch than performances on it. The wait goes on.</p>'
