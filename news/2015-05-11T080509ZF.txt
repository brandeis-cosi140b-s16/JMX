b'Football transfer rumours: Paul Pogba to earn \xc2\xa3250,000 per week after tax at Manchester City?'


b'<p>Austerity? What austerity? Although smirking assassin Iain Duncan Smith is ready to return to the cabinet to oversee \xc2\xa312bn in welfare cuts, Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba is unlikely to feel any sort of pinch. Manchester City are widely reported to be on the verge of offering the 22-year-old down with \xc2\xa3250,000 per week \xe2\x80\x93 netto \xe2\x80\x93 in the hope of repelling the advances of Real Madrid, Manchester United, Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea, who are also showing predictable interest in the player. Pogba\xe2\x80\x99s Mr 15%, Mino Raiola, who also represents Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Marek Hamsik, Romelu Lukaku and Mario Balotelli among others, is reported to be very, very happy at the prospect of negotiating a deal that would earn Juventus a minimum of \xc2\xa350m and his client \xc2\xa3385,000 per week before tax.</p> <p>Manchester City are also being linked with a \xc2\xa330m move for Kevin De Bruyne, who helped the Bundesliga side Wolfsburg qualify for the Champions League next season, following his \xc2\xa318m departure from Chelsea in January 2014. The Express reports that the Belgian winger has had his ear repeatedly bent and burned by his compatriot Vincent Kompany, who\xe2\x80\x99s been giving him the hard sell. In the event of his arrival at the Etihad, City striker Edin Dzeko could move the other way.</p> <p>Meanwhile, at Old Trafford, Manchester United suits are plotting another raid on Eindhoven, where the 24-year-old PSV midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum has caught the eye of Louis van Gaal. An attacking, right-sided midfielder blessed with scorching pace and a razor sharp football brain, Wijnaldum caught the eye of Arsenal and Liverpool as a young Feyenoord player, but chose instead to advance his football education in the Netherlands with PSV.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to be fully prepared for the top foreign leagues then I believe you have to have learned everything in the Eredivisie,\xe2\x80\x9d he once said and five years on, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably safe to say he\xe2\x80\x99s ready to make the step up. United are also reported to be in \xe2\x80\x9cadvanced\xe2\x80\x9d negotiations with Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s right-back Nathaniel Clyne, whose future may well be decided this week. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, we like to know what he decides and then if he accepts this offer from the club,\xe2\x80\x9d said his manager Ronald Koeman on Saturday. \xe2\x80\x9cWe like to know it. After the weekend, it will be a good time to sit together and mention what will happen with Clyne. I can give him some advice, but it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult. He has to make that decision.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Having got used to playing in front of small crowds at Monaco, Dimitar Berbatov could continue to do so in the intimate but considerably more bawdy environs of Bournemouth\xe2\x80\x99s compact Dean Court stadium. Everybody\xe2\x80\x99s favourite louche Bulgarian is 34, but remains as fleet of foot over 20 metres as he was a decade ago and ought to be available on a free transfer from a club who are only allowed a 22-man squad next season as punishment for past transfer naughtiness.</p> <p>Having failed to make an impact at Manchester City or Aston Villa, the next leg of Scott Sinclair\xe2\x80\x99s retirement tour could take him to The Hawthorns, where West Brom are believed to be interested in taking him off City\xe2\x80\x99s hands. Another Villa loanee, goalscoring\xe2\x80\x99s Tom Cleverley, has \xe2\x80\x9chinted\xe2\x80\x9d that he wants to make his move to Villa Park from Manchester United permanent, possibly by walking up and down outside Old Trafford wearing a sandwich board with \xe2\x80\x9cI want to make my move to Villa Park from Manchester United permanent\xe2\x80\x9d daubed on it in big letters.</p> <p>The Manchester United purgatory of Radamel Falcao is also approaching its end, with Spanish side Sevilla, who see him as a potential replacement for his compatriot Carlos Bacca, who looks likely to leave the Estadio Ram\xc3\xb3n S\xc3\xa1nchez Pizju\xc3\xa1n despite insisting he is happy with his lot in Seville.</p> <p>In other red-hot South American striker news, French sports daily L\xe2\x80\x99Equipe say Edinson Cavani is determined to leave PSG this summer, with Manchester United his likely destination. Another striker likely to take his business elsewhere is Real Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa340m-rated French goal-getter Karim Benzema, who is also wanted by United. And Arsenal. And Liverpool.</p> <p>Chelsea representatives are planning to drive a van to Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s training ground, where they will bundle central defender Diego Godin, midfielder Koke and striker Antoine Griezmann into the back and leave the thick end of \xc2\xa3110m by way of compensation. Up on Merseyside, Liverpool are hoping to sign Borussia Dortmund striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, having missed out on the Manchester United-bound Memphis Depay, who they didn\xe2\x80\x99t really want anyway. In dire need of new attacking options for next season, the club\xe2\x80\x99s transfer committee have held protracted talks among themselves, taken a vote and agreed they like the cut of the Gabon international\xe2\x80\x99s jib.</p> <p>And finally, the number of Guadeloupean strikers gracing the Premier League could increase by one if West Ham are successful in their bid to bring Guingamp hitman Claudio Beauvue to Upton Park. Having revealed last month that he\xe2\x80\x99d be leaving the Ligue 1 club this summer, the 27-year-old has attracted interest from Tottenham, Hull City, and Everton, but West Ham are rumoured to be in the box seat as far as securing his services is concerned.</p>'
