b'Football transfer rumours: Chelsea to send Petr Cech on loan to Liverpool?'


b'<p>At this time of year, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to spare a thought for the less fortunate members of our society. The often sad, often lonely souls who drift around with little companionship, little by way of genuine human contact and warmth. The people who, for whatever reason, are thought of as having something \xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d about them. Something that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t quite fit. As we all come together to celebrate a giving time of year, let us bring them in and offer them a hug.</p> <p>Yes, today\xe2\x80\x99s Rumour Mill goes out to the goalkeepers, those strange individuals who stand at one end of a field while 20 others play football. Liverpool need one, and by crikey they\xe2\x80\x99re going after a big \xe2\x80\x99un, according to in-the-know sages up and down the land. Petr Cech is the man they want to step into Brad Jones\xe2\x80\x99s shoes, the Chelsea man having largely filled his time since the return of Thibaut Courtois by sitting on the bench and wailing on some drums. Apparently Liverpool want him on loan and Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho, wily old fox that he is, reckons that it might help Chelsea out more to have Cech playing for someone else rather than being their reserve \xe2\x80\x93 the theory of course being that Liverpool aren\xe2\x80\x99t title rivals any more, that he won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to play against Chelsea but will against teams that they are actually competing against. Oh Jos\xc3\xa9, you old card. It would be a brassy move by Liverpool, and perhaps slightly more likely/realistic is talk that they already have a \xc2\xa33m deal in the bag for Mexican stopper Guillermo Ochoa from M\xc3\xa1laga.</p> <p>Elsewhere in keeperland, it seems Real Madrid have been listening to all those chin-strokey sages explaining why it\xe2\x80\x99s no coincidence that David de Gea keeps having shots hit directly at him \xe2\x80\x93 so much so that they\xe2\x80\x99re planning on hoofing a colossal bag o\xe2\x80\x99 cash in Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s direction, on the off chance they wish to part with the man who is part Lev Yashin, part Jim Carrey\xe2\x80\x99s Grinch. The fee in question would have to be more than the \xc2\xa333m Juventus paid for Gigi Buffon all those years ago, should the Talks ever progress into Advanced Talks and perhaps even graduate to full-blown Negotiations. De Gea himself, if you care to ask, isn\xe2\x80\x99t massively keen on the idea apparently, and is perfectly comfortable where he is, thank you very much.</p> <p>Moving further up the pitch (but not too far \xe2\x80\x93 the Mill likes to take things slow), things haven\xe2\x80\x99t exactly panned out as Ashley Cole probably envisioned in Rome \xe2\x80\x93 unless, that is, that his plan was to do OK at the start then get dropped and spend most of his time loafing around as a substitute. No fear though: like Harry Ellis in Die Hard, Crystal Palace are Cole\xe2\x80\x99s white knight, bubby, and will take him on loan for the rest of the season.</p> <p>Another man for whom this year isn\xe2\x80\x99t going 100% as expected is Adnan Januzaj, the boy king who was one of the few bright bits of Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s 2013-14, but from whom we\xe2\x80\x99ve barely heard a peep this term. He\xe2\x80\x99s subsequently a wanted man, with David Moyes seemingly dead set on the idea of loaning the youthful Belgian for Real Sociedad, which might suggest that Moyes is Januzaj\xe2\x80\x99s spirit animal. An arresting image, for sure. Inter are keen on one of them loans too, and they\xe2\x80\x99re also sniffing around Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Mohamed Salah. Januzaj doing one could make room at Old Trafford for Ivan Rakitic, only signed by Barcelona in the summer but already set to be pushed out of Catalunya, it says here. Manchester City are also keeping tabs on how that whole hoopla plays out.</p> <p>Spurs have a simple plan: get rid of Roberto Soldado and Emmanuel Adebayor, and buy Jackson Mart\xc3\xadnez. Easy. Straightforward. Elementary. No problem. It\xe2\x80\x99s exactly as simple as that, with no doubt many and varied clubs just desperate to take those two strikers off their hands. No worries. Amazed they haven\xe2\x80\x99t thought of this before.</p> <p>Elsewhere, word around the playground is that Sunderland are after Danny Ings; Burnley and Leicester are keen on Dwight Gayle; West Brom and Saido Berahino have reached an impasse in contract negotiations with both Liverpool and Spurs keeping a keen eye on things; West Ham are still planning to bin Sam Allardyce at the end of the season, despite being all good again and stuff; Billy Davies is set to be the new Rangers manager in possibly the funniest and most doomed appointment since the last time he was given a job; and finally, Kirsty and Dommo snogged round the back of the maths block during morning break. Pass it on.</p>'
