b"Manuel Pellegrini's Manchester City must push on to retain Premier League | Paul Wilson"


b'<p>Manchester City&apos;s task this season, aside from any adventures in Europe, is to do what only two other sides have done in the last 22 years, and hang on to the Premier League title.</p> <p>That frequently aired statistic is also somewhat misleading. The fact that Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho&apos;s Chelsea only managed back-to-back wins once, when a tremendous start to his second season in charge left rivals playing catch-up from the outset, makes it seem the achievement is a difficult one. Yet the other team to retain a title, Manchester United, used to do it for fun.</p> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson managed the feat on six occasions, and twice put together winning sequences lasting three seasons, which makes it look as though the English league can be just as easily dominated by an outstanding team as, say, Spain or Germany. The question really is whether City are yet ready to be categorised as an outstanding team. They are certainly a very good team, well managed under the sober direction of Manuel Pellegrini, and two titles in three seasons tell their own story. Yet to be outstanding in the Premier League at the moment requires the rest of the competition to be dutifully submissive, to accord the reigning champions the sort of awed respect that Manchester United used to command in the days when sheer self-belief used to be worth a goal or two to Ferguson&apos;s sides, and the English league just isn&apos;t like that any more.</p> <p>For a start those cliches about teams at the bottom being able to beat teams at the top happen to be true \xe2\x80\x93 witness Crystal Place effectively ending Liverpool&apos;s title challenge last season or Cardiff and Aston Villa beating Manchester City early in the campaign. You still get the odd easy game in the Premier League, the standard has not risen to the extent where every match is ultra-competitive, but there are fewer mugs than there used to be 20 years ago, fewer teams looking for a quiet life at the lower end of the table and &quot;picking their matches&quot; in the manner that earned Mick McCarthy such censure in 2009 when he unapologetically sent a team of reserves to Old Trafford to concentrate on a more winnable fixture later in the week.</p> <p>While that might be an extreme example, it serves to illustrate a philosophy that has largely been abandoned, and not just because United last season became such an easy touch. In most Premier League seasons the relegation struggle no longer revolves around a few no-hopers who identify themselves early, it now actively involves up to half the teams in the table and lasts the whole campaign. In those circumstances teams are not going to throw in the towel and meekly accept their fate \xe2\x80\x93 the financial consequences of failure are too great. Just look how much teams in the lower half of the table are spending to try to ensure survival, and compare that to the situation in other leagues around Europe. Some of the spending may not be prudent, but it does show the Premier League is big time all the way down.</p> <p>If that makes the English league slightly more competitive than it used to be, the situation in the top half of the table confirms the fact that City are facing a greater challenge than ever to stay on top. With all due respect to Ferguson&apos;s golden achievements at Old Trafford, most of the time in the league United were fighting off only one rival. In the early years Newcastle provided the stiffest competition, then Arsenal became United&apos;s main rivals, then Chelsea arrived from nowhere to take up the fight. The important thing to note is that when Ferguson was going toe to toe with Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger, Newcastle slipped out of contention, exactly as Wenger himself did when Mourinho first came along.</p> <p>The situation at present is subtly different. Wenger is still around, and spending as if he expects to make an impact at the top of the table.</p> <p>Mourinho is back, having impressively strengthened a team that beat City home and away last season. United are unlikely to be obligingly out of the picture this season \xe2\x80\x93 with an expensive new manager and no European commitments they ought to be good for a return to the top four at least.</p> <p>Tottenham and Everton also have designs on the top four without necessarily striking anyone as potential champions, while Liverpool minus Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez and plus a Champions League schedule may not be quite the force in the Premier League they proved last season but are still difficult to dismiss.</p> <p>So there are three or four teams with hopes of winning the league, and perhaps six candidates for a top four spot. That degree of competition is something on which the Premier League can congratulate itself, though City are going to have to push on to another level to dominate such a strong field. If their summer signings have been somewhat hampered by financial fair play limitations, at least they appear to have addressed the areas that needed attention: a strong, quick centre-back and someone to provide competition for Joe Hart in goal. They have not invested in a new goalscorer, presumably because they see no need to with Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero, Edin Dzeko and David Silva still around. That seems fair enough, though Ag\xc3\xbcero will need to stay fit. If he is absent again for long periods it could cost City, as could another draining encounter with the Champions League.</p> <p>City are still coming to terms with European football, whereas Chelsea and Arsenal take Champions League matches in their stride. Can they dominate in these circumstances? Probably not, or at least not in the way that United used to do in their pomp. They appear capable of winning the league, but so do some of their rivals. There is no longer one outstanding team at the top of English football, and for that we ought to be grateful. Whoever finishes first can claim an outstanding achievement. If it happens to be City, the new man at United is going to have to come up with something pretty extraordinary in his second season to top it.</p>'
