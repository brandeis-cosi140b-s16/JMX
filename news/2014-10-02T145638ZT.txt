b'The Fiver | Oh Mario! How could you not do the little dance!'


b'SUPER FUNKY MARIO <p>In modern football, it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough for players to jog about a bit, trying to kick the ball and occasionally head it, with a view to making passes or scoring a goal and stuff. No, they\xe2\x80\x99ve also got to jig about like dancing bears at the end of each game, in front of the stands, applauding the supporters for putting in 90 minutes of hard graft eating pies, snorkeling bevvy, and filming over-rated midfielders under-hitting corners on their smartphones. Woe betide the player who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t prostrate themselves thus! And so last night Mario Balotelli, the funk raging after Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s risible display in Basel, stormed off straight down the tunnel without first doing the little dance. Oh Mario! How could you not do the little dance!</p> <p>Balotelli took his leave at double-quick time despite entreaties made by Brendan Rodgers, who wanted to see the little dance. \xe2\x80\x9cMario worked hard but needs to do more,\xe2\x80\x9d blasted Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s jolly cross manager after the match, his teeth the whitest shade of white when juxtaposed with a livid face. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if he came back to the fans.\xe2\x80\x9d Working on the assumption that every member of Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s travelling support last night was over six years old, the Fiver would argue that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, and that Rodgers might have one or two more pressing concerns, given his team are currently playing in a manner which might be best described as Hodgsonian. That state of affairs was alluded to by captain $tevie Mbe, who instead of announcing his immediate retirement, said this: \xe2\x80\x9cWe were aggressive with and without the ball against Everton but we went back to where we have been for most of the season tonight, which is not good enough.\xe2\x80\x9d Oh dear. At least he did the little dance.</p> <p>But there was some much-needed good news for Liverpool today, as Mr Roy named his England squad for the upcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers against Basingstoke Town and the Fox &amp; Hounds Pub/Bistro (Over-65), as Daniel Sturridge \xe2\x80\x93 unlike Southampton defender Nathaniel Clyne and Swansea midfielder Jonjo Shelvey \xe2\x80\x93 wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in it. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a great blow for us and it\xe2\x80\x99s been a big blow for Liverpool, of course,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr Roy of the decision to omit the unfit/fit (delete as appropriate) Sturridge, one which in fairness suits both parties: it means Sturridge won\xe2\x80\x99t fall apart on England duty again after being asked to do some training, and also that Liverpool can\xe2\x80\x99t blame England the next time Sturridge succumbs to body-knack, which he undoubtedly will, in three or four weeks or so; set your clocks.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Mr 5pm himself, John Ashdown, for Krasnodar 0-0 Everton in Big Vase, followed at 8pm by Tottenham 2-1 Besiktas with Scott Murray.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI remember we were in the changing room at Old Trafford and my phone started vibrating from inside my trouser pocket. Keano could hear the vibrations and went crazy trying to find out who the phone belonged to. That\xe2\x80\x99s who he was. Before we beat [The Queen\xe2\x80\x99s] Celtic 1-0 last season, I noticed him by the side of the pitch as a pundit as we went out to warm up. I hid my face with my hand because he still scares me. I was 26 years old, and I was $hitting myself\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Gerard Piqu\xc3\xa9 reveals the trauma that invariably follows a first-hand encounter with Roy Keane.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel.

Obviously some rich Russian oligarch would just buy all the best bakers in the world then probably put them in a team called \xe2\x80\x98Chelsea-Bun Baking Club\xe2\x80\x99 or something\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Dan Makeham.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOpening yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver for my daily dose of you-know-what-it-is-you-produce, I was alarmed to find that it appeared to be presented in some weird broadsheet set-up that did not fit into my little Outlook viewing screen and so would have required horizontal as well as vertical scrolling. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you can appreciate my consternation. Now, it is just possible that it was just the same thing as always but I did my computer wrong, it has happened before and I will suggest that it just might happen again, however I\xe2\x80\x99m comfortable enough putting that blame back your way because you-know-what-it-is-you-produce. I have little intention of speaking to my office IT gremlins and asking them how to reformat a sarcastic football email, and in doing so destroy what little respect remains that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t dashed by the whole debacle where I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to reaffix the Y key after levering it up because I wanted to know what was under there (answer: a surprisingly complex little setup that needs IT assistance to recreate). So, let\xe2\x80\x99s not be having this issue again, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Michael Hunt (and 1,056 others).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMay I please be the first of 1,057 pedants to point out that the FA moved out of its Soho Square headquarters in 2009 (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver). Even for the Fiver that really is quite out of touch. Mind you, given Mr Roy\xe2\x80\x99s general uselessness, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if he turned up to work at the wrong office every day without anybody even noticing\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Paul McGettigan.</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
