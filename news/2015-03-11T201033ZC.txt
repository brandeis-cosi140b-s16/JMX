b'<p>Lianne Sanderson\xe2\x80\x99s second-half goal against Canada helped England\xe2\x80\x99s women lift the Cyprus Cup for the third occasion as Mark Sampson\xe2\x80\x99s side warmed up for this summer\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup finals in style.</p> <p>After England tasted victory at the tournament in 2009 and 2013 by beating Canada in the final, a cool finish from the Arsenal Ladies striker midway through the second half was enough to secure their third triumph. It was the only goal conceded by Canada \xe2\x80\x93 who will host the World Cup in June \xe2\x80\x93 during the competition and consigned them to their first defeat in 10 matches.</p> <p>Having beaten Finland and Australia in the group stages before drawing 1-1 with Holland, England made nine changes, with only Alex Greenwood and Jordan Nobbs, who captained her country for the first time, keeping their place. The Chelsea left-back Claire Rafferty made her first appearance in two and a half years after her comeback from a third anterior cruciate ligament injury.</p> <p>The Manchester City midfielder Jill Scott went close in the first half when her side-footed shot was tipped over the bar, while England\xe2\x80\x99s Siobhan Chamberlain got down smartly to save Christine Sinclair\xe2\x80\x99s low effort from 12 yards. But the game\xe2\x80\x99s only true moment of quality came on 67 minutes, when Sanderson finished off a tidy move after a flick-on from Jodie Taylor.</p> <p>Canada left-back Allysha Chapman almost equalised in the fifth minute of added time, but Chamberlain produced a wonderful save high to her left to secure the victory.</p> <p>England now have one more home match before they fly to Canada in June. They entertain China at Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s new Academy Stadium on Thursday 9 April.</p>'
