b'Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s Ronald Koeman signals top-four aim after defeat of Stoke'


b'<p>Before anyone gets too carried away about Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s flying start and labels them title challengers, it is worth remembering that similar words were said about them this time last year. Southampton were fifth after nine games, four points off the top, had the best defensive record in the league and the report in this newspaper on their 2-0 victory over Fulham  wondered how far Mauricio Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s side could go. However, injuries took their toll on a thin squad and Southampton faded away, finishing eighth, before they were hit by the loss of Pochettino to Tottenham Hotspur and sold five key players in the summer. That was supposed to be that for Southampton.</p> <p>A year on, though, and here we are again: Southampton are second after nine games, they have the best defensive record in the league with only five goals conceded and people are becoming understandably giddy about Ronald Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s enterprising young side. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re gonna win the league,\xe2\x80\x9d the Southampton fans sang during Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s 1-0 victory over Stoke City, their sixth win in their past seven matches. They are enjoying this blast of deja vu.</p> <p>Of course, Southampton fans were not being entirely serious. They are aware that their run of fixtures has been kind and realistic enough to know that there is little point discussing Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s title credentials because, more often than not, these things tend to level out once the big teams with the big squads shake off their early-season rust. The Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s ruling classes may turn a blind eye to interlopers in autumn but they are less welcoming when the business end of the season is on the horizon.</p> <p>You can tell that Koeman does not want to allow expectations to get out of control. He clearly thinks Southampton are good but he does not want to go too far. Yet even he could not resist suggesting that they can challenge for the top four, especially with Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United underwhelming so far.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou can make up your own mind, but up to now maybe we deserve more points; we lost at Liverpool when we deserved more and maybe you can say the same when we lost at Tottenham,\xe2\x80\x9d Koeman said. \xe2\x80\x9cCity have a great team, Chelsea are probably the most complete side at the moment, but the rest have not shown until now that they have a better team than us. It\xe2\x80\x99s too early to say what we would like to win this season \xe2\x80\x93 when expectations are high, the best solution is to live day by day. It is only a start.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe there is an opportunity for us because Arsenal and Liverpool have a tough programme with Champions League football to play, but they have 25 or 26 players in their squads who are all internationals.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>After last week\xe2\x80\x99s 8-0 thrashing of Sunderland, Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s win over Stoke was more graft than craft. They played well in the first half and took the lead through Sadio Man\xc3\xa9, but it was a slog after the break. Yet Southampton, showing why they have only conceded five goals, took great satisfaction from the way they kept Stoke at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why today is a very good win,\xe2\x80\x9d Toby Alderweireld said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe expectations are rising, everyone, especially at home, maybe thinks we are going to win easily, and against a good opponent like Stoke it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult to achieve that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It will be even harder for Southampton to stay where they are now but they are banging on the door.</p> <p>Man of the match: Dusan Tadic (Southampton)</p>'
