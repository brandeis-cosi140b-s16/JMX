b'Dejan Lovren: \xe2\x80\x98I never expected that I would be somebody\xe2\x80\x99'


b'<p>When he was three years old Dejan Lovren\xe2\x80\x99s family had to flee Yugoslavia or \xe2\x80\x9csomebody would have been killed\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>The central defender billed by Brendan Rodgers as Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s new Jamie Carragher endured a childhood that can hardly be imagined. Yet Lovren maintains this was crucial in forming an inner strength that has helped his rise to be the marquee summer signing for the five-times European champions. No wonder Rodgers views Lovren, who cost \xc2\xa320m from Southampton, as a natural leader despite being only 25. The man whose goal secured Southampton a fine win at Anfield last season is intelligent and open, willing to engage in debate and offer a range of opinions formed by his own experiences that include a challenge to those on these shores who believe immigrants can never be a force for good.</p> <p>Born in Zenica in what is now Bosnia-Herzegovina, Lovren and his family fled to Germany from his home town in 1992, 12 months before 15 people were massacred when its market was bombed. Eight years of agonising uncertainty in Munich ensued as Lovren lived under the threat of being deported with his parents. After finally being ordered to leave, Lovren arrived as a stranger in Croatia and could hardly speak the language of the country he went on to represent in the World Cup this summer.</p> <p>Lovren, who will make his senior debut against his old club at Anfield on Sunday, says: \xe2\x80\x9cThe family left because of the war. If we stayed, somebody would be killed. It was horrible in this time \xe2\x80\x93 we were prepared to go to Germany, my parents took the decision and said: \xe2\x80\x98We don\xe2\x80\x99t have a choice any more.\xe2\x80\x99 My father and mother\xe2\x80\x99s parents were already there so we were the last. We took the bags, one little car, and we were in Germany.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere was an attack on the market a year after we left. A lot of people were killed. It showed to me it is a difficult life. It was really difficult for my parents to leave the country at 27, 28 years old, and say: \xe2\x80\x98Come on, we need to go to Germany.\xe2\x80\x99</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t speak German, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about this, you are going like a blind man and, with a child like me at three years old, this was really difficult for the family. But this is what gave something to me, it made me stronger inside. It showed me life is never easy, you will earn everything with work. I saw everything on my parents, and I said to myself: \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to live my life like this.\xe2\x80\x99 They gave me everything they could but it was not amazing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of his family\xe2\x80\x99s deportation for effectively being illegal immigrants, Lovren says: \xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the right papers. My grandfather yes, because he left Bosnia two years before the war, so he had the papers for my grandmother, but not for my father and mother.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was difficult. A lot of people were trying to go to Germany because of the war and they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t give [permission] to everyone. I think after seven years in Germany the situation calmed down and we went back in 1999.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Lovren\xe2\x80\x99s family settled in Karlovic, a town south-west of Zagreb, Croatia\xe2\x80\x99s capital but new problems emerged. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was really difficult for me because I had many friends [in Munich]. I had three years in the nursery and four years in the school. I was German-speaking, and I arrived 10 years old to Croatia, and really wasn\xe2\x80\x99t speaking a lot at home with my parents in Croatian, so it was really difficult to write in Croatian,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt took me two years after I went back to learn everything again in Croatian. It was difficult because you know, when you\xe2\x80\x99re a kid, the others kids are laughing at you over things like that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Although Lovren had played for a small club in Munich there were no dreams of life as a footballer. \xe2\x80\x9cI never expected that I would be somebody. I just started playing and when I was 12, 13, thought: \xe2\x80\x98Wow, I\xe2\x80\x99m playing good.\xe2\x80\x99 Then Dinamo Zagreb were speaking about signing me, I thought: \xe2\x80\x98Hmm, maybe I can achieve something.\xe2\x80\x99</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut I was just a normal child. I had a dream about Bayern Munich, they were my team. I had my photos taken with Giovane \xc3\x89lber, [Mario] Basler, [Bixente] Lizarazu. I have all these pictures in my room. I would go to the training ground to see them. The guys here [outside Melwood, Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s training ground] waiting? That was me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He will not say his upbringing made him more determined but adds: \xe2\x80\x9cI would say I\xe2\x80\x99m proud about this. I know where I came from, it will always be in me. Maybe it was better to happen like this, than maybe to have a good childhood when you don\xe2\x80\x99t know the real life.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>While some hold that immigrants can never be a positive addition to society, Lovren reflects on how the chance of a fresh life in Germany was the catalyst for his career. \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, of course, but it was normal in Germany at that time to accept immigrants after the war. What can you say to them? Say \xe2\x80\x98No\xe2\x80\x99 and send them back and they will be killed? I understand the situation and still I\xe2\x80\x99m here as a stranger but everyone needs to accept [those] who will work for this country and who will make money for this country. These people deserve to be here.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>After joining Dinamo in 2006, Lovren won two championships in four years before moving to Lyon for \xc2\xa38m. He helped win the French Cup and took part in two Champions League campaigns during his three and a half seasons there, before last summer\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa38.5m move to Southampton.</p> <p>Lovren came close to joining Liverpool while at Lyon, where he endured a hostile time. \xe2\x80\x9cThey criticised me in many ways,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cEven from the beginning when I arrived. They were asking: \xe2\x80\x98Why is this guy \xe2\x82\xac10m?\xe2\x80\x99 It was always: \xe2\x80\x98Why this? Why this? Why this?\xe2\x80\x99 Always something. When I was playing good, nobody was saying I was playing good. When I was playing bad,\xc2\xa0I would be the first one on the front of the journal. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t easy for me. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t respect me as a player.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Lovren, who has 28 Croatia caps and scored on his Liverpool bow \xe2\x80\x93 Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 4-0 hammering of Borussia Dortmund \xe2\x80\x93 shrugs when asked about the Carragher comparison. \xe2\x80\x9cThe manager said he sees me like a leader. I said to him: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m still young. I\xe2\x80\x99m 25, but I will try my best. I will lead the team.\xe2\x80\x99 I don\xe2\x80\x99t have so much experience like Jamie Carragher but it will come and it is a great honour to be compared by the manager with a player like that.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI like to talk during the game, I like communication with the lads \xe2\x80\x93 to keep me awake apart from anything else. But it\xe2\x80\x99s the beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Liverpool finished an impressive second last season. Of the club\xe2\x80\x99s title hopes, Lovren says: \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say that we can win it but we have a really good chance. Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United, also Manchester City. They are the ones. It will be tight, like last season, but we will be here fighting. I think it will be even better than the last year.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
