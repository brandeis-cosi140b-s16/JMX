b'<p>... nothing. Chelsea mop up the set piece, and that\xe2\x80\x99s that! Chelsea were on the back foot for the majority of that match, but they escape from the Parc des Princes with a precious draw - and an away goal! PSG will wonder how they didn\xe2\x80\x99t win the match. Chelsea will be strong favourites to make it to the quarter-finals now. An entertaining game, albeit not one that\xe2\x80\x99ll take up too much space in Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s long history book.</p>     Thibaut Courtois gives a thumbs up to the Chelsea faithful and they no doubt returned the favour as a number of vital saves by the Chelsea keeper meant they left Paris with a draw rather than a defeat.
