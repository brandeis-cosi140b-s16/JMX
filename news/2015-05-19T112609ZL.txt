b'Louis van Gaal still adamant England Under-21s should let Luke Shaw rest'


b'<p>The Football Association\xe2\x80\x99s discussions with Manchester United over Luke Shaw playing for the England Under-21s this summer have failed to change the club\xe2\x80\x99s stance with Louis van Gaal adamant the left-back should rest in the close season.</p> <p>The FA had hoped to change the manager\xe2\x80\x99s view that Shaw requires time off following a difficult first season at United after his move Southampton last summer.</p> <p>Shaw has suffered nine different injuries since joining the club, including the current facial problem that ruled him out of Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 1-1 draw with Arsenal at Old Trafford. Because of this poor record of availability United have reiterated to the FA that Shaw should be allowed to recuperate before a busy pre-season which includes United\xe2\x80\x99s two-week tour of the United States which starts in mid-July.</p>  <p> Related: Louis van Gaal still struggling to teach United the art of consistency | Jamie Jackson </p>   <p>Gareth Southgate, the England Under-21s coach, wants Shaw available for the friendly with Belarus on 11 June and the European Championships which begin a week later in the Czech Republic. The tournament will involve a minimum of three matches in the group stage, the last of these being played on 24 June.</p> <p>While Southgate announces his squad on Wednesday morning \xe2\x80\x93 enough time for each side to reach an agreement \xe2\x80\x93 he is expected to name Shaw for the matches next month.</p> <p>If he does and no compromise has been reached, Van Gaal will be not be happy. Last Friday the Dutchman made his view clear on the Shaw issue. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen he is not playing for United he cannot play for other teams. He needs that rest I think, because he has over-crossed his limits, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why. He\xe2\x80\x99s 19 years old, what do you expect? We have to protect him and I hope that the coach of the Under-21s is understanding for that reason.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
