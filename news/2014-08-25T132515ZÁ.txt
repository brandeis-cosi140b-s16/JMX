b'\xc3\x81ngel di Mar\xc3\xada and the problem of Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s central midfield | Jamie Jackson'


b'<p>After another dismal Manchester United performance against Sunderland on Sunday came a Louis van Gaal revelation regarding his desperation to solve the dearth of central midfield talent at the club. \xe2\x80\x9cKagawa \xe2\x80\x93 I have tried to play him in that position in the US and he could not fulfil my wishes and my philosophy,\xe2\x80\x9d the manager said of an experiment with the Japanese on the summer tour. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have spoken about that and he is more of a No10. Mata was playing at No10 [at Sunderland] and I thought I had to change the other players, which is why I chose to bring on Januzaj.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Gaal thereby signalled that Shinji Kagawa\xe2\x80\x99s United career may be in critical condition and also illustrating why \xc3\x81ngel di Mar\xc3\xada may be a \xc2\xa360m red herring. The Argentinian is a fine footballer, a member of the elite band below Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, but he is no chief conductor of central areas.</p> <p>To audition Kagawa for the role shows, in one stroke, Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of Tom Cleverley, Marouane Fellaini, Darren Fletcher, Anderson and Ander Herrera as a squadron, and illustrates where the manager feels he really should strengthen.</p> <p>To compound this Fellaini, Herrera and Anderson, plus Jesse Lingard, the forward Van Gaal is forced to deploy further back, are all unavailable. Michael Carrick, another central midfielder, is also injured. This caused the use of Adnan Januzaj \xe2\x80\x93 a No10 or wide man \xe2\x80\x93 in the engine room when the Belgian entered the fray in the 63rd minute of Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 1-1 draw.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not usual that we have four injuries in midfield,\xe2\x80\x9d Van Gaal said. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery club that has that has a problem. That is why I played Januzaj in midfield because as a coach I want to win. I have said that we need creative passing and I thought Januzaj could provide that. That is the reason.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is because of creation. Kagawa can also create, but I asked Adnan to play there because of the lack of midfielders. When he played in Belgium, he played in midfield so I asked if he could do it for us. I said to him: \xe2\x80\x98You are on the bench as a midfielder,\xe2\x80\x99 because I want him to focus. He played there and you could see it\xe2\x80\x99s not so many times that he\xe2\x80\x99s played there. But he did his utmost and I cannot demand more.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The United midfield problem is not new. Doctorates could \xe2\x80\x93 and maybe should \xe2\x80\x93 be written about how and why it is yet to be resolved. Van Gaal joins Sir Alex Ferguson and David Moyes as managers who, since Roy Keane and Paul Scholes faded and Owen Hargreaves suffered a career-hobbling injury, have found the problem a puzzle.</p> <p>The word is that Di Mar\xc3\xada, a wide player by instinct, could be moved inside though into the No10 position at present given to Juan Mata by Van Gaal. Yet even here doubt hovers. \xe2\x80\x9cAt this moment, we have five No9s and four No10s and don\xe2\x80\x99t have wingers to give us attacking width,\xe2\x80\x9d the Dutchman said a couple of weeks ago, before describing Di Mar\xc3\xada as a winger of the \xe2\x80\x9chighest level\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>This suggests Van Gaal is not paying a British record fee for Di Mar\xc3\xada to be a fifth No10. So where will he play? As a wing-back in the 3-5-2? If not then in a 4-3-3, maybe?</p> <p>The conundrums keep coming. Van Gaal switched United from a traditional four-sentry defence to a three centre-back system to accommodate the attacking trident of Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Mata. To tear this plan up after a summer-long bedding-in period and the season\xe2\x80\x99s opening matches may confuse a squad Van Gaal is adamant requires three months to adjust to his methods, as the 63-year-old retrains them to use \xe2\x80\x9cbrains\xe2\x80\x9d rather than instinct.</p> <p>A glance at United\xe2\x80\x99s competitors shows how all harbour midfield gold. Manchester City boast the A-lister Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9, plus Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup player Fernandinho, as well as Frank Lampard and Fernando. The latter was a \xc2\xa312m summer bargain from Porto and precisely the ilk of midfielder United should be acquiring.</p> <p>At Liverpool, Brendan Rodgers has a Premier League great, Steven Gerrard, supported by Jordan Henderson, Lucas Leiva, Adam Lallana and Joe Allen, plus the potential of Emre Can. Chelsea have two gun midfielders in Cesc F\xc3\xa1bregas and Nemanja Matic, who are complemented by Ramires and Mikel John Obi. And how Van Gaal might like to choose from Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Aaron Ramsey, Jack Wilshere, Santi Carzola, Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Flamini. Or even Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger believes will one day be a deep-lying maestro \xe2\x80\x9cvery similar to Steven Gerrard\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Against Sunderland Van Persie and Rooney were starved of chances. Even Phil Jones hinted at the lack of creation. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were dominant in possession and created glimmers of chances, but never really carved them open like we would have liked,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to keep working on everything.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The hope is that the closing week of the window will prove to be a particularly long time in the club\xe2\x80\x99s transfer fortunes. Juventus\xe2\x80\x99s Arturo Vidal, Milan\xe2\x80\x99s Nigel de Jong and Ajax\xe2\x80\x99s Daley Blind, who is also a defender, are on Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s radar. Any of these trio\xe2\x80\x99s signature would strengthen midfield and transform hopes.</p> <p>United would arrive at 2 September having ended the summer by adding Luke Shaw, Herrera, Marcos Rojo, Di Mar\xc3\xada (assuming that he arrives) plus AN Other midfielder.</p> <p>The continual line of players offering post-match promises to improve next time could then end. \xe2\x80\x9cWe dropped two points today,\xe2\x80\x9d Van Persie said post-Sunderland. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were a bit too sloppy in possession, and in that sense we made it too hard for ourselves. We\xe2\x80\x99ve played two games and only picked up one point. We would have loved to have got six points but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen, so we have to bounce back.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 This article was amended on 29 August 2014. Because of an editing error, the names of Frank Lampard and Fernando appeared in the wrong order, leading to the implication that it was Lampard who was a \xc2\xa312m signing from Porto.</p>'
