b'Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas tops Premier League statistics but there are surprises | Jacob Steinberg'


b'<p>Are you sitting down? Good, then you are in the perfection position to digest the shocking news that with the first half of the season behind us Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas has made the most passes, touched the ball the most times, created the most chances and, you guessed it, made the most assists in the Premier League. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope that Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger does not read this article. Who could have guessed that F\xc3\xa0bregas would turn out to be such a success for Chelsea?</p> <p>You do not need to analyse Opta\xe2\x80\x99s statistics for too long to realise the extent of the former Arsenal and Barcelona midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s influence on Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side. It is clear that F\xc3\xa0bregas\xe2\x80\x99s imagination and ability on the ball has been a major factor in Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s rise to the top of the league, transforming them from a side that sometimes struggled to break down negative opponents last season into one that contains a player who can unlock even the most stubborn defences in the blink of an eye.</p> <p>F\xc3\xa0bregas treats the ball as if it is his best friend and it is not a surprise that he has made more passes (1,563) than any other player. Only Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 (1,478) comes close to him and it helps that F\xc3\xa0bregas is combining well with his midfield partner, Nemanja Matic, who is in third place with 1,209 passes.</p> <p>Despite F\xc3\xa0bregas keeping them ticking over, Chelsea have not made the most passes in the league overall. Instead, they are third (10,315), below Manchester City (11,265) and Manchester United (10,392). Bottom of the pile are Crystal Palace (5,798), while it is interesting to see that West Ham United, much-vaunted for their new attractive style, are fourth lowest (6,956). United are also marginally out in front for passing accuracy (85.4%), while City are second (85.2%), Chelsea are third (85%) and Palace are lowest (67.7%).</p> <p>Maybe City could argue could argue that they have been the most enterprising side, given that they have made the most passes in the opposition half (7,116) and had the most possession on average (59.6%); evidence, perhaps, that Chelsea sometimes go on the retreat when they have the points in the bag. Chelsea are fifth in the possession statistics, behind City, United, Arsenal and Everton.</p> <p>Yet Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s midfield is a well-oiled machine and it is revealing that F\xc3\xa0bregas has responded well to the work rate Mourinho demands from his players. When it comes to the distance covered by each player, only Stoke City\xe2\x80\x99s Steven N\xe2\x80\x99Zonzi has covered more ground than F\xc3\xa0bregas (214.8km to 213.2km), while Matic is again third with 210.2km and it will please Mauricio Pochettino to discover that Tottenham Hotspur\xe2\x80\x99s Christian Eriksen is fourth with a lung-busting 210.1km.</p> <p>However, distance covered does not necessarily equate to speed. The player who has made the most sprints is Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s indefatigable Scott Arfield (1,248). In third place? Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s George Boyd (1,156). Sean Dyche\xe2\x80\x99s men give it their all.</p> <p>Incidentally, N\xe2\x80\x99Zonzi has also made the fifth most passes, which is a sign of Stoke City\xe2\x80\x99s evolution under Mark Hughes, although the midfielder is not in the top five for the most successful passes. Gareth Barry (1,034) and Phil Jagielka (965), which is absolutely terrific news for Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez, but the three most accurate passers are F\xc3\xa0bregas (1,367), Tour\xc3\xa9 (1,324) and Matic (1,065).</p>       <p>At this point, this is in danger of becoming a Chelsea love-in, despite suggestions of a media campaign raging against Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side. F\xc3\xa0bregas has had the most touches of the ball (1,928) in the league and he has been impressively productive with it, laying on 13 assists for his team-mates.</p> <p>Mind you, it is worth delving a little deeper into the meaning behind assists. For instance, the quality of the assist matters and Chelsea have scored 39 goals inside the box and only two from outside the area (City are second with 35 goals). Yet would F\xc3\xa0bregas\xe2\x80\x99s numbers be so high if Chelsea had Fernando Torres up front instead of Diego Costa? It is, of course, impossible to say with absolute certainty but consider this: while F\xc3\xa0bregas has inevitably created the most chances (61), West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s Downing is second (54). Interestingly, West Ham, playing to the strengths of their forwards, and Southampton have been the most prolific crossers (380 and 366 respectively) and Chelsea and Everton have been the least prolific (228 and 225 respectively).</p> <p>Then again, Chelsea have benefited from F\xc3\xa0bregas\xe2\x80\x99s delivery from set pieces. Along with Palace, West Brom and West Ham, they have scored the most goals from dead-ball situations (11) \xe2\x80\x93 the basic lesson here is that F\xc3\xa0bregas is very good at football. At the other end of the scale, Aston Villa have managed a paltry three goals from set pieces and eight from open play. Villa have hit the woodwork three times.</p>       <p>A picture emerges of Chelsea as the most complete side. In stark contrast to Everton and Swansea, who have dropped 15 and 16 points from winning positions respectively, Chelsea have fought back from behind to secure 10 points, as have Newcastle. Along with Hull City, Chelsea have conceded only twice from set pieces, while Palace and Queens Park Rangers have conceded 11 each, and Arsenal, Stoke and West Brom have shipped 10 each. Hazard is the best dribbler by a considerable distance, completing 89 of his attempted 151 dribbles, and opponents have had to resort to the dark arts in an attempt to stop him. He has been fouled 55 times, pipping Raheem Sterling by three hacks.</p> <p>Not that kicking Hazard has worked. The Belgian, along with Sterling, has created the most chances from open play in the league (46).</p> <p>As for City, they have hit the most shots (228), hit the woodwork the most times (11) and Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero, the league\xe2\x80\x99s top scorer with 14 goals, has had the most shots on target, 34, which is six more than his closest competitor, QPR\xe2\x80\x99s Charlie Austin. Yet Chelsea have been more clinical. They have had 114 of their 226 shots on target.</p>       <p>There is work to do for Everton \xe2\x80\x93 their players have been caught offside 49 times, while Newcastle, a counterattacking side, are propping everyone else up. The flag has only been raised against them 22 times.</p> <p>Southampton have been impressive defensively. They have made the most tackles (441), which has resulted in Victor Wanyama committing the most fouls (38), while Tottenham are second (427). Down at the bottom, Burnley have made 299 tackles and Everton could probably do with getting stuck in a bit more. They have made only 316 tackles and \xe2\x80\x93 this is not necessarily related \xe2\x80\x93 have been fouled the most times (246).</p> <p>Southampton have also done well to keep opponents away from their goal. They have only faced 174 shots and have only had to make 41 blocks, which suggests that Ronald Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s tactics are ensuring there is no need for too much last-ditch defending. The same cannot be said for Burnley, who have allowed 304 shots on their goal, or for Hull, whose players have had to make 96 blocks.</p>       <p>At least they are getting themselves in the way, though. Robert Green is not receiving much protection from QPR\xe2\x80\x99s defenders. He has conceded the most goals, 31, but has also made the most saves, 69.</p> <p>Everton, who have made the most errors that have directly led to a goal (10), and Leicester have only kept three. Burnley, Chelsea, United and Stoke have only made one. Maybe United\xe2\x80\x99s defence is not so bad after all.</p>       <p>Finally, Sunderland and Richard Dunne\xe2\x80\x99s QPR have scored the most own goals (four). You may want to remain seated for a while.</p>'
