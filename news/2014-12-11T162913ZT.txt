b'The Fiver | This seismic communiqu\xc3\xa9'


b'<p>GRANNY FIVER MAKES AN EXECUTIVE DECISION</p> <p>You\xe2\x80\x99ll have to forgive the Fiver for taking its eye off the ball over the last 24 hours. You see, a fairly major announcement yesterday afternoon shocked Big Paper Mansions to its core, as one of the greatest names in the Guardian\xe2\x80\x99s long, storied history announced their intention to step down from their executive position. Yes, Granny Fiver sent out a press release informing the nation of her plans to relinquish her role as Head of Household, Chez Fiver as of November 2029. We\xe2\x80\x99re stumped as to why this seismic communiqu\xc3\xa9 didn\xe2\x80\x99t get more coverage in media sections around the world, but you can be sure the Fiver has since thought of nothing else. That\xe2\x80\x99s because the Fiver has designs on her job. No, because the Fiver misses her already. That\xe2\x80\x99s right. The Fiver misses her already.</p> <p>But the Fiver does have designs on her job. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99ve put together a detailed five-point plan, suggesting ways to make a great product even better. Number one is to keep Shortbread McFiver\xe2\x80\x99s bottle of Fistfight, the 69.7% ABV whisky-flavoured turps beverage, watered down with milder industrial solvents in the hope of getting a full day\xe2\x80\x99s work out of him at some point during the next decade. Numbers two to four we\xe2\x80\x99re leaving blank for now, so we can respond to breaking events in 2028; the Fiver is proactive if nothing else. And No5 is a pledge to remember our roots as the Manchester Fiver, and always be unctuous and obsequious to everyone from that fine city. That of course has always been a given when it comes to United, if what we read on City, Liverpool, Leeds and Guardian forums is anything to go by. But poor old City have been getting a rum deal when it comes to oily types applying the soft soap.</p> <p>That\xe2\x80\x99s the opinion of Manuel Pellegrini, anyway. \xe2\x80\x9cThis team deserves a little bit more credit than the press gives us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in the wake of City\xe2\x80\x99s meh performance against blah in whatever tinpot trophy they were faffing around in last night. But of course we\xe2\x80\x99re making a joke, and a particularly poor one even by the Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s dismal post-1999 standards. City were in fact excellent away at Roma, putting in a performance of both sparkle and solidity when they really needed it, suggesting a mental block in Europe has finally been cleared. \xe2\x80\x9cYou must decide to play without [Vincent] Kompany, without Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9, without [David] Silva, without [Sergio] Ag\xc3\xbcero. It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult for a team. But I had a lot of trust in what we could do.\xe2\x80\x9d So well done to Pellegrini, and to City, who have made it through to the Round of Arsenal for the second season in succession. They really are a superb bunch of chaps. A great set of lads. The best.</p> <p>Last season, of course, City had the misfortune at this point to land better-than-best Barcelona, so will be hoping for a kinder draw this time round. Perhaps Monaco, Borussia Dortmund or Porto instead of Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid, Real Madrid or Barcelona? Perhaps. Though all six options would be certain to set City (who are simply adorable) a stern test. After all, as Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho says as he awaits Monday\xe2\x80\x99s draw, there are \xe2\x80\x9ca few sharks in the ocean\xe2\x80\x9d. Actually, that\xe2\x80\x99s given us an idea for another pledge ahead of the Granny Fiver landgrab: We Will No Longer Take Throwaway Mourinho Quotes And Repeat Them Ad Nauseam. Good one, huh? It might be too late to stop the Steve Reich-influenced repetitions of the word \xe2\x80\x9cshark\xe2\x80\x9d we\xe2\x80\x99ll be hearing every time Big Cup is mentioned between the draw and the matches in February. But once we get the top gig in late 2029, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be all over this sort of nonsense like a rash.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Jacob Steinberg will be here at 6pm GMT for MBM coverage of Besiktas 1-1 Harry Kane\xe2\x80\x99s Hotspurs, while Scott Murray will then oversee Everton 2-0 Krasnodar.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re hoping a lot of the youngsters especially will want to be photographed with him\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 West Brom sales and marketing suit Adrian Wright hopes wrongly after a waxwork of Ben Foster was made.</p>      OUR NEW LOOK (AKA, SELF-FLAGELLATION DEPT) <p>Big Website\xe2\x80\x99s football and sport pages have a new look. Check them out for yourself, read about the design changes, and then queue up, flaming pitchforks in hand, to complain here.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFollowing on from Marina Hyde\xe2\x80\x99s column (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Still Want More?), maybe someone should direct Messrs Messi &amp; Ronaldo here. Taking their horrible \xe2\x80\x98suit-off\xe2\x80\x99 to a whole new level\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Kevin Dartnaill.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou say in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Bits and Bobs that \xe2\x80\x98Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey has removed the bushel from in front of his light to roar that his Big Cup goal against Galatasaray was the best he has ever scored\xe2\x80\x99. As someone who has worked for an Archbishop, can I be the first of many pedants to point out that, in this Biblical metaphor, a bushel is in fact a type of bowl that would have been placed on top of the light/lamp/candle obscuring it from view \xe2\x80\x93 not placed in front of it. Unless, of course, you were referring to former Sun columnist and beard-wearer Garry Bushell, in which case your use of the phrase is totally fine\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Kerron Cross (and 1,056 others).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn Barry Glendenning\xe2\x80\x99s Knowledge column (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Still Want More?), he investigates whether cancelling the Christmas party following poor performances leads to an upswing in results? I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help but wonder: a) do the Fiver, Weird Uncle Fiver, $exually Repressed Morris Dancing Fiver et al go out to celebrate the festive season? (I can only assume that Fiver isn\xe2\x80\x99t welcome at the Guardian Christmas do); and b) if such an event were cancelled, what would be the effect on the quality of the Fiver?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Tom Herne [quality? \xe2\x80\x93 Fiver Ed].</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDid anyone else see \xe2\x80\x98The Missing\xe2\x80\x99 on Tuesday night? Quite a drama \xe2\x80\x93 hard to fathom out what\xe2\x80\x99s going on. Just to clarify, I was talking about the Jimmy Nesbitt series, not Raheem Sterling\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Dougall MacArthur.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy work email account helpfully informs me that \xe2\x80\x98to ensure privacy, images from remote sites were prevented from downloading\xe2\x80\x99, and replaces said images with plain white boxes, filled solely with a file name teasing their mysterious contents (eg \xe2\x80\x98Basel cartoon\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98All the waste, all the sham, all the haste\xe2\x80\x99, or surely the worst, \xe2\x80\x98Fiver header\xe2\x80\x99). Can I request that professional visual-description authors are employed alongside the \xe2\x80\x98journalists\xe2\x80\x99 responsible for the Fiver, captioning every picture in tedious detail, so that us optically-challenged folk don\xe2\x80\x99t miss out? Of course I could merely click on one button, helpfully placed right next to my security warning, to display the pictures, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to do that\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Patrick Leach.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
