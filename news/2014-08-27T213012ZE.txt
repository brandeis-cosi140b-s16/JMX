b'Everton\xe2\x80\x99s Eto\xe2\x80\x99o makes peace with Mourinho despite age comment'


b'<p>Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o has said he was annoyed by the inquest into his age at Chelsea last season but will hold no grudge against Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho when they meet at Goodison Park on Saturday.</p> <p>The 33-year-old was unveiled as Everton\xe2\x80\x99s latest signing  on Wednesday having rejected better financial offers to sign a two-year contract with Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s side. The Everton manager claimed the transfer was risk-free given Eto\xe2\x80\x99os availability as a free agent, his hunger to win a trophy in England and the influence his winning mentality will have on young players such as Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku.</p> <p>Eto\xe2\x80\x99o, who on Wednesday retired from international football with Cameroon, scored 12 goals in 35 appearances for Chelsea, Everton\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League opponents this weekend, but his one season at Stamford Bridge was dominated by questions over his age. Mourinho fuelled the debate when having cast doubt over the striker\xe2\x80\x99s official age in what he claimed was a private conversation, his comments were publicised by the French TV channel Canal+. The striker made light of Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s remark with a goal celebration depicting a pensioner holding his back against Tottenham but admits the focus was a distraction and that he needed time to adjust to the Premier League following two seasons at Anzhi Makhachkala.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt annoyed me and disturbed me a little,\xe2\x80\x9d said the striker. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes I would say to myself: \xe2\x80\x98Why?\xe2\x80\x99 but the most important thing is what you do on the ball. It was a mistake [to debate his age] but I just got my head down and worked. I spent two great seasons playing in the Russian championship. English football is very different and I had to adapt to it much more than I would have had if I had stayed in the Russian league. But after a season I felt a lot better, a lot fitter.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>This summer, Eto\xe2\x80\x99o described the Chelsea manager as \xe2\x80\x9ca fool\xe2\x80\x9d for his comment but now claimed to feel no animosity towards Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no problem with Jos\xc3\xa9, I will shake his hand on Saturday,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true he said something that came out very clumsily in the press but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he wanted to do me harm. I have great respect for him because he gave me the opportunity to come to Chelsea. I thought I had a lot to offer them but for whatever reason it didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Eto\xe2\x80\x99o would have been a Liverpool player but for Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99s decision to go with Mario Balotelli \xe2\x80\x93 he met Anfield officials in Paris on Friday \xe2\x80\x93 and received more lucrative offers than he accepted from Everton. \xe2\x80\x9cFinancially there were many other deals he could have gone for,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mart\xc3\xadnez. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not have all the details but, 100%, our offer was less.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The three-times Champions League winner and four-times African Footballer of the Year explained: \xe2\x80\x9cI met clubs in Italy but the most important thing for me was to find a club that would allow me to do what I wanted most, which was to play football and let me share my experience with the other players. There were other clubs but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the end of my career panning out with them.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI saw Everton and met with Roberto. We had the same passion for football and the same passion for how the game should be played and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I took the decision to go with Everton. I am here for two years and hope to be here for a lot more. My body and my heart will decide what I do after that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mart\xc3\xadnez believes Eto\xe2\x80\x99o needs time to gain match fitness but may require the veteran against Chelsea with Lukaku struggling with a toe injury and Aroune Kon\xc3\xa9 still sidelined. The Everton manager said: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see the signing as a risk because a risk is when you are investing money you cannot afford. This is not a risk at all. We sat down for a coffee on Sunday and straightaway I knew that he\xe2\x80\x99s mentally in the right place and has the right reasons behind the move. He\xe2\x80\x99s as hungry as he\xe2\x80\x99s ever been in his career. His determination to be successful in the UK is incredible.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a decision that was forced by a chequebook. It was a football conversation and this felt right to him. From our point of view, we have so much talent but we need that know-how. We need a player who can share the emotions of winning titles and knowing what that takes.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSamuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o has achieved so many firsts, he has so much history in World Cups and the Champions League, but he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t won an honour in the UK and wants to achieve that. For me, the tipping point was when he said the reason for wanting to stay with a team in the Premier League was to win honours. We need that in our dressing room.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
