b'Football\xe2\x80\x99s late-breaking unbeaten runs and winning streaks'


b'<p>\xe2\x80\x9cI recall a few seasons ago my club, Wolves, earning a shock win against a then-unbeaten Manchester United in early February,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Daniel Yambao. \xe2\x80\x9cThis got me thinking, what\xe2\x80\x99s the latest in the season that a club\xe2\x80\x99s unbeaten run has come to an end? Obviously, Invincible seasons don\xe2\x80\x99t count. How about the latest a 100% winning run coming to an end?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>We\xe2\x80\x99ve found a couple of examples of teams losing for the first time on the final day of a season. Perhaps most notably, it happened to Rangers in 1967-68, where not only did the club\xe2\x80\x99s first reverse, a 3-2 slip at home to Aberdeen, deny them an unbeaten season at the very last, but it also denied them the league title. Celtic had been beaten just once in their campaign \xe2\x80\x93 at Ibrox the previous September \xe2\x80\x93 and won their last 16 league games on the spin to take their third successive championship (they\xe2\x80\x99d win the next six as well) by two points. Ouch.</p> <p>The 2012-13 Portuguese title chase was a cracker of its ilk, with both Porto and Benfica making it to the penultimate game of the season undefeated. In their 28th game of the season they played each other in a title decider with Benfica two points clear, but they lost that game 2-1 and despite winning their final fixture they lost the title by a point. Worse, having developed a taste for crucial 2-1 defeats three days later Benfica lost the Europa League final by the same score (to Chelsea), and then 10 days after that they lost, again 2-1, in the final of Portugal\xe2\x80\x99s domestic cup, the Ta\xc3\xa7a de Portugal, to Vit\xc3\xb3ria de Guimar\xc3\xa3es, and so ended the season empty-handed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was so hard to take,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nemanja Matic, a member of the desolated side and now of Chelsea. \xe2\x80\x9cWe lost the title, the Europa League and the Portugese Cup in two weeks. These things happen maybe once in a thousand years.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Another notable undefeated run that ended at the penultimate hurdle belonged to Levadia Tallinn, who having lost only once in winning the 2008 Meistriliiga didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose at all in winning the 2009 title, with four games to spare. Thus when they did lose, with the league trophy already glistening in their rapidly-filling cabinet, to Trans Narva in November 2009 it was a first defeat in a mildly impressive 61 games. It would be wildly rather than mildly impressive had their manager, Igor Prins, not promptly declared that \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t deny that we went such a long time unbeaten because of an absence of strong opposition\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>In terms of 100% winning runs, Celtic came very close to a very good one in 2003-04 when they won 25 of their first 26 games, the one hiccup coming, annoyingly, in their very first game of the season, drawn 0-0 at Dunfermline. They next dropped league points in March, when Motherwell grabbed a draw at Celtic Park, and they were then beaten twice in their last six games.</p> <p>Beyond these shores it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to better Benfica (again), who \xe2\x80\x93 having won their last six games in 1971-72 \xe2\x80\x93 strolled to victory in the first 23 games of the 1972-73 season, with Eusebio their inspiration, before finally drawing 2-2 at Porto. They went on to register Portugal\xe2\x80\x99s first ever unbeaten season. Britain can claim a hand in it, though \xe2\x80\x93 England\xe2\x80\x99s own Jimmy Hagan was in the dugout, and for all their domestic success they were sent tumbling out of the European Cup by Derby County in round two (which allowed them to concentrate on the league, of course).</p> MULTIPLE GOALKEEPERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9c21 February saw the first league game of 2015 in the Hungarian top flight \xe2\x80\x93 the Paks\xe2\x80\x93Nyiregyhaza match was postponed from December. Due to the registration rules none of Ny\xc3\xadregyh\xc3\xa1za\xe2\x80\x99s winter signings could play in the match (only players registered for the teams back in December were available for selection). That \xe2\x80\x93 coupled with injuries and a suspension \xe2\x80\x93 left Nyiregyhaza with only 14 players, three of whom were goalkeepers. Goalie Volodymyr Ovsienko started up front on his top flight debut at the age of 36 and played 81 minutes. In the 90th minute the backup goalie Alex Hrabina was subbed in as an outfield player, too. Do you know of any other instances that two goalkeepers played for the same team as outfield players in a top-flight match?\xe2\x80\x9d asks Marosi Gergely.</p> <p>The short answer, Marosi, is no. But the most famous incident of top-flight double-goalkeeper-usage, in England at least, occurred in 2005 when Stuart Pearce, while managing Manchester City in a match against Middlesbrough, replaced a midfielder, Claudio Reyna, with the goalkeeper Nicky Weaver in order to fling first-choice custodian David James up front in search of a late winner.</p>     David James entertains City fans with a \xe2\x80\x98turn of pace\xe2\x80\x99. Photograph: Michael Regan/Action Images    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI sat at home on Saturday night and thought to myself: \xe2\x80\x98What shall I do if we\xe2\x80\x99re drawing the game late on and need to hit it long?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d explained Pearce. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a good striker in Jon Macken, who is really disappointed, but I wanted to unsettle them and in some ways it did. It unsettled everyone \xe2\x80\xa6 them and us.\xe2\x80\x9d James played in attack for the final two minutes of the game, and five of bonus stoppage-time, in which City won \xe2\x80\x93 no thanks to him \xe2\x80\x93 a penalty, which Robbie Fowler missed, before the match ended in a 1-1 draw.</p> <p>The Knowledge could dredge up a couple of comparable incidents, and one of them also involved Pearce. In 2009, now in charge of England\xe2\x80\x99s Under-21s, Pearce saw so many players withdraw from his squad through injury that he could rustle together only four outfield substitutes for a home friendly against Azerbaijan. He merrily used them all up, bringing on Danny Rose, Richard Stearman, Andrew Taylor and Jack Rodwell inside 62 minutes, meaning that when Lee Cattermole hurt his leg with 15 minutes remaining he had little choice but to bring on Joe Lewis, then of Peterborough, as a makeshift striker. Despite the disruption England cantered to a 7-0 win.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe were at a loss as what to do,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pearce. \xe2\x80\x9cWe used all our outfield subs and Joe put himself forward to go up front. It was a forced sub. Whichever way we did it we didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be seen as disrespectful. That was the last thing I wanted.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Finally we found brief mention of a Second Division (in old money) game between Sheffield United and Nottingham Forest in 1936 in which, according to the Mirror, the Blades played \xe2\x80\x9cwith a goalkeeper on the wing and a back in goal\xe2\x80\x9d and still won 4-1. The Guardian reported that \xe2\x80\x9cUnited had their goalkeeper hurt, and another player also injured, but even so were victorious\xe2\x80\x9d. If you know any more details, we\xe2\x80\x99d be delighted to hear them.</p> YELLOW FEVER <p>\xe2\x80\x9cJust noticed Sevilla vs Atletico produced 11 yellows (seven to Atletico) and this made me wonder how many yellows has a team got in a game without any red,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Ravid Alon.</p> <p>We turned up an FA Challenge Cup encounter between Tongham Youth and Hawley Reserves in November 1969, which ended with the referee\xe2\x80\x99s notebook bursting with the names of every single player from both sides \xe2\x80\x93 and one of the linesmen.</p> <p>So unusual was it that a documentary about the game, Booked, has recently been completed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt got into the Guinness Book of Records but then it just disappeared from history,\xe2\x80\x9d Booked\xe2\x80\x99s director, John Bush, tells the Knowledge of the match, which Tongham eventually won 2-0. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing on the internet anywhere, and neither club nor the relevant counties had records going back that far. But I managed to track down eight of the original players, and I found the referee, who didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be involved because he\xe2\x80\x99s still sore after all these years.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe was in his second year of refereeing, only 23 years old, and I think he had a bit of a problem getting his authority recognised. The general feeling was that he was being overzealous with the whistle, so some of the lads started getting a bit lippy. The rumour was that the linesman, who was also the Tongham manager, had gone onto the pitch uninvited to help an injured player, which is why the ref booked him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>After the final whistle the referee went into both teams\xe2\x80\x99 changing-rooms and retrospectively booked every player who hadn\xe2\x80\x99t already been booked, for dissent. One player was in hospital at that stage, having sustained a nasty cut to his head, but he got booked as well. Another player couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go to the game at all, so found someone else to play instead of him using his name. He was booked too, despite being at a wedding at the time.</p> <p>However it only half counts, because at a meeting of the Aldershot FA a few weeks later all the bookings were overturned. And it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count at all, because one player was sent off. Still, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good yarn.</p> POISONED CHALICE <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI have a question about a sequence of results,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Robin Clarke (him again). \xe2\x80\x9cIn the First Round of this season\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup Coventry City lost to Worcester City. In the Second Round Worcester City lost to Scunthorpe United, eventually. In the Third Round Scunthorpe United lost to Chesterfield. In the Fourth Round Chesterfield lost to Derby County. In the Fifth Round Derby County lost to Reading. Has this \xe2\x80\x98poisoned chalice\xe2\x80\x99 path to the Cup Final ever concluded with the runners-up?</p> <p>Really quite frequently, would be the rather disappointing answer. Given that everyone beats someone who won in the previous round, the chain can only really falter at the third round, if the losing side had only joined the competition at that stage. So for example last year\xe2\x80\x99s chain stops with Leeds, losers to Rochdale in round three but not involved in round two (Rochdale then lost to Sheffield Wednesday, who lost to Charlton, who lost to Sheffield United, who lost to Hull who lost to Arsenal). In three of the last four seasons, though, the chain goes all the way through to round one, and sometimes some way further.</p> <p>You only need to go back two years to find the best poisoned chalice run possible. In 2012-13 Causeway United lost to Continental Star in the extra preliminary round, and Continental Star lost to Stourpot Swifts in the preliminary round. The Swifts then lost in the first qualifying round to Stafford Rangers, who lost in the second qualifying round to Gresley, who slipped up in the third qualifying round to Ilkeston. In the fourth and final qualifying round Ilkeston lost to Fylde, who lost in the first round proper to Accrington Stanley, who lost in the second round to Oxford United, who lost in the third round to Sheffield United, who lost in round four to Reading, who lost in the fifth round to Manchester United. In their quarter-final United lost to Chelsea, who were in turn beaten by Manchester City in the semi-finals, who slipped up against Wigan in the final.</p> KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI vaguely recall hearing that Shay Given has a special bottle of water he puts in his goal before every match,\xe2\x80\x9d Damien Hensley vaguely recalled in 2007. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this really true?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Well, Damien, according to the man himself, it is. Prior to every game he plays, the Republic of Ireland keeper places a vial of Lourdes holy water at the back of his goal as a lucky charm. \xe2\x80\x9cI carry it in my kit bag and it goes everywhere with me,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the Irish News of the World in 2002. Apparently, the water carries with it powers that many Roman Catholics ascribe to the Lourdes spring, where apparitions of the Virgin Mary first appeared in 1858. Given also takes a picture of his late mother wherever he goes. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been doing it since he was small,\xe2\x80\x9d revealed his father Seamus. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how much he remembers her because he was so young when she died, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to forget about her.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It won\xe2\x80\x99t come as any real surprise that goalkeepers are as superstitious they come, and myths abound that Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s will never wear brand new shirts unless they have already been washed. Apparently, this dates back to the Gunners\xe2\x80\x99 1927 FA Cup final defeat to Cardiff, when Dan Lewis blamed a greasy new woollen top for the mistake that led to the only goal of the game.</p> <p>Prior to this, the Woolwich Arsenal keeper Leigh Richmond Roose (cited by the Daily Mail in 1905 as one of the capital\xe2\x80\x99s most eligible bachelors, no less) had a similar clothing ritual. Legend has it that Roose played every match with an unwashed \xe2\x80\x98lucky\xe2\x80\x99 black-and-green Aberystwyth top underneath his jersey. \xe2\x80\x9cRoose is one of the cleanest custodians we have, but he apparently is a trifle superstitious about his football garments, for he seldom seems to trouble the charwoman with them,\xe2\x80\x9d read one March 1904 account in Bolton\xe2\x80\x99s Cricket and Football Field. \xe2\x80\x9cConsiderable amusement was created at Stoke on Saturday and again at Liverpool on Monday, when it was noticed that Roose alone failed to turn out in spic and span garments. His pants, we should say, carried about them the marks of many a thrilling contest.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>CAN YOU HELP?</p> <p>While reading a glib comment on an internet message board that Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s defeat to Liverpool had effectively meant that Chelsea won two trophies on one day, I had a thought \xe2\x80\xa6 has that genuinely ever happened? Teams can obviously win a league if other results go their way and they could, theoretically, be playing a cup final in another competition on the same day. Does anyone know if this has ever happened?\xe2\x80\x9d wonders Eoin Byrne</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI am a Celtic supporter. This month we are playing Dundee United three times in a row in separate competitions (Scottish Cup, League Cup and Premiership),\xe2\x80\x9d writes Pat Jordan. \xe2\x80\x9cHave two teams ever played each other three times in a row in separate competitions before?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHow big a psychological blow is it to concede right before half time? What percentage of teams have lost after conceding in the 40-45th minute?\xe2\x80\x9d asks Michael Hughes.</p> <p>Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com</p>'
