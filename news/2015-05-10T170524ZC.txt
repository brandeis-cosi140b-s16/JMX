b'Chelsea 1-1 Liverpool | Premier League match report'


b'<p>For Liverpool, the game is up. An afternoon which had begun with a grudging show of respect for the newly crowned Premier League champions, the visitors lining up along either side of a blue carpet to form a guard of honour as Chelsea trooped triumphantly into the arena, ended with Champions League football effectively out of their reach. Given the constant and bellowed reminders of the destiny of this season\xe2\x80\x99s title, this was a galling occasion for those in red.</p> <p>The deficit from the top four has been extended to six points with two games to play, and goal difference counting horribly against them. As \xe2\x80\x9coutstanding\xe2\x80\x9d as Brendan Rodgers insisted his team were after the interval, this performance failed to yield the victory which would have preserved those fading chances. Instead, the talk in the aftermath was of a \xe2\x80\x9cbig summer ahead\xe2\x80\x9d when shrewd recruitment, and presumably plenty of persuasion if key targets are to be secured, will be required if their challenge is to prove more persuasive next year. A Europa League campaign most likely awaits, and that will create its own disruption.</p> <p>In truth Liverpool, as the team with something at stake, had felt the more threatening of the sides on show with Chelsea, as Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho conceded, struggling throughout to generate proper intensity to their approach having already secured the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s most glittering prize. Yet, for all that Raheem Sterling, Jordan Ibe and the league debutant, Jerome Sinclair, buzzed disconcertingly in enemy territory, supplied by the elusive Philippe Coutinho, the visitors lacked the quality to prevail. The Brazilian saw a late shot deflected off Gary Cahill to wrong-foot Thibaut Courtois for a split second, though the chance played out in slow motion and the goalkeeper was able to flop down on the loose ball. It all rather summed up Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s season, a campaign when the goals of Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez and Daniel Sturridge have been so sorely missed. They lacked bite here to inflict proper wounds.</p> <p>The goals that were mustered in a disjointed contest were supplied by the old guard. John Terry\xe2\x80\x99s opener had been thumped in early, Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas\xe2\x80\x99s corner veering into the penalty area for the centre-half to rise too easily above Rickie Lambert and plant a header down and beyond Simon Mignolet and Steven Gerrard on the goal-line. The goal was Terry\xe2\x80\x99s 39th in the Premier League, establishing him as the highest scoring defender in the revamped top flight.</p> <p>Liverpool complained, with some justification, that his supplier should not have been on the pitch even then, F\xc3\xa1bregas having been guilty of a nasty foul on Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s right ankle in the opening 25 seconds. \xe2\x80\x9cHe should have been sent off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rodgers. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was out of control, diving [in], stretching. A poor challenge.\xe2\x80\x9d Andre Marriner had actually flashed a red card at Mikel John Obi, so off the pace had he been in that opening minute, before correcting that to a lenient yellow for F\xc3\xa1bregas. The confusion hardly inspired confidence.</p> <p>The visitors\xe2\x80\x99 response to the concession had actually been impressive, sparked as it was by Coutinho spitting shots at goal for Branislav Ivanovic to block and Courtois to save, though parity was only restored when their own captain made his presence felt. Ivanovic\xe2\x80\x99s foul on Adam Lallana earned a free-kick which Jordan Henderson arced over the muddle in the six-yard box. Gerrard, having edged away from Mikel, was unmarked as he nodded in his first goal against these opponents in a decade.</p> <p>It was his first ever reward at Stamford Bridge, an arena where he has been mercilessly heckled over the years, memories of which would not be erased by the charitable and admirable ovation granted him by all corners of the ground upon his substitution 11 minutes from time. Mourinho praised that reaction for the \xe2\x80\x9cdear enemy\xe2\x80\x9d who will not grace this stage again. Gerrard, himself, was not quite ready to forgive and forget.</p> <p>Chelsea had actually been denied a potential farewell of their own, Petr Cech having cried off the fixture with a minor calf injury having been pencilled in to start the game. \xe2\x80\x9cThe next game, at West Bromwich Albion [on Monday week], he plays,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho, who intends to pick the likes of Nathan Ak\xc3\xa9 and Isaiah Brown at the Hawthorns. \xe2\x80\x9cIzzy Brown came from West Bromwich so it\xe2\x80\x99ll be special for the kid to play in that house \xe2\x80\xa6 the boys deserve it, all of them, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t give a special day for everyone.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He offered Ruben Loftus-Cheek an hour here on his first Premier League start, with the teenager doing little wrong in a midfield brief before being withdrawn as his manager sensed Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s late urgency might leave him exposed. \xe2\x80\x9cCoutinho was getting more space between the lines, so it was best for the boy to leave,\xe2\x80\x9d added the Portuguese. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it was a fantastic experience for him, to feel the intensity and the speed of the game. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a Chelsea player, that\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt. I\xe2\x80\x99m happy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The same cannot be said for Liverpool, even with the point secured on a ground where Chelsea remain unbeaten in the league. For Rodgers, and the hierarchy at Anfield, a pivotal summer awaits.</p> <p>Man of the match Philippe Coutinho (Liverpool)</p>'
