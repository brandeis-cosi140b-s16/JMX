b'England squad extend a warm welcome to new boy Harry Kane'


b'<p>On the first occasion Wayne Rooney trained with England, aged 17 and back in his days as football\xe2\x80\x99s original assassin-faced baby, he announced himself by taking the ball round a couple of defenders and chipping David James with the delicacy of a champion golfer holing from off the green. His new team-mates were so bewitched they broke into spontaneous applause.</p> <p>Harry Kane eased himself in less spectacularly but, again, there hardly seems to have been a flicker of apprehension. Rooney has 101 caps, is closing in on Sir Bobby Charlton\xe2\x80\x99s goals record of 49 and before training he was presented with the England player\xe2\x80\x91of\xe2\x80\x91the-year award. Then the practice session started on the blowy pitches at St George\xe2\x80\x99s Park and the little piece of paper in Roy Hodgson\xe2\x80\x99s hand firmed up the view that England will have a new-look attack in Friday\xe2\x80\x99s game against Lithuania. The names of Rooney and Kane were alongside one another and both were circled.</p> <p>Kane will surely start England\xe2\x80\x99s latest Euro 2016 qualifier and his presence has certainly enlivened the sense of occasion. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve had only the one training session but you can see he\xe2\x80\x99s got real presence,\xe2\x80\x9d Michael Carrick said of his new colleague. \xe2\x80\x9cI think he\xe2\x80\x99s been sensational. If you look at the start of the season to now he\xe2\x80\x99s jumped up a couple of levels at least. He\xe2\x80\x99s maybe gone up two or three levels.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Raheem Sterling to skip England\xe2\x80\x99s friendly with Italy to return to Liverpool </p>   <p>For now, Kane has been excused an audience with the media, the Football Association\xe2\x80\x99s thinking being that he should not be overexposed. Everything Kane has done over the past few months indicates the 21-year-old would have handled it with no issue but there is a legitimate argument that if he is hyped too much the pressure on him to excel on his international debut could become a considerable weight.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI do really hope people have a reasoned approach and give this guy a chance,\xe2\x80\x9d Hodgson said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is going to have some good games and some bad games and hopefully he has 10 to 12 years of potential England matches in front of him. Let\xe2\x80\x99s not build him up to be the best thing we have ever had or a flop on the basis of a month or two or a couple of games. Give the lad a chance.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Gary Cahill made the same point but even then the warning came attached with a eulogy. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be careful,\xe2\x80\x9d Cahill said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s still a young boy and being in the senior squad, with big players you don\xe2\x80\x99t really know, can be daunting. It is easy to talk up a young player too much and I think we do that a lot in this country. But for me he has everything.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe can hold the ball up, he runs in behind, he has two good feet, he can head, he can finish, he has a bit of pace. Physically, he is strong enough. He has all the attributes and he has had a fantastic season. To meet up with the England squad for the first time, coming off the back of a hat-trick \xe2\x80\x93 his confidence must be absolutely sky high.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Cahill has personal experience of the damage Kane can wreak on defences, having been part of the Chelsea team who were beaten 5-3 by Tottenham at White Hart Lane on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day. Kane scored twice, set up another, won a penalty and caused Cahill and John Terry more problems than any other player this season.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve played against him three times and he has been a real handful but on that day in particular he was fantastic,\xe2\x80\x9d Cahill said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say he\xe2\x80\x99s like a Gabby Agbonlahor but he\xe2\x80\x99s powerful in his running. He is quick, a powerful boy and physically more than capable of playing in this league. The attributes are all there and he deserves his place in the squad.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Does he deserve to start? Cahill is in the camp that says yes and it has reached the point where it would be more of a shock if a player with 29 goals this season was kept back. Wembley is sold out and Kane is the obvious draw. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got four top strikers all chomping at the bit to play and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he would relish the opportunity,\xe2\x80\x9d Cahill said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat will be down to the manager but, for me, yes he\xe2\x80\x99s ready to play.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Carrick, now the oldest player in Hodgson\xe2\x80\x99s squad, has the same view. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes you see young players who have a good spell and then drop away, but I just don\xe2\x80\x99t see that with him. You can see the progression. As the spotlight has grown on him, as he\xe2\x80\x99s been talked about more and given more praise, and as defenders have started becoming more aware of him, he\xe2\x80\x99s actually taken his game on and on. That is what has impressed me the most. At the weekend he had a big call-up and then you see him score a hat-trick. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good sign, as if he thrives on that little bit of pressure and expectation.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Carrick, 33, also made the point that England under Hodgson is generally a welcoming environment for new players. In different times, cliques have existed between the Manchester United and Liverpool contingents. The players will say that is no longer the case. \xe2\x80\x9cThe squad now is an easy one to come into,\xe2\x80\x9d Carrick said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were talking about that between ourselves this morning. There\xe2\x80\x99s a really good atmosphere. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost like a club atmosphere. Go into the dressing room and the feeling is quite bubbly, energetic, but relaxed at the same time. So hopefully it\xe2\x80\x99s an easy place to settle into and thrive.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
