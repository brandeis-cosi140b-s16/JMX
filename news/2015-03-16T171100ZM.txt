b'Manuel Pellegrini: I\xe2\x80\x99ve never felt that if I don\xe2\x80\x99t win I\xe2\x80\x99m out at Manchester City'


b'<p>There is a moment near the end of this conversation with Manuel Pellegrini, when the tiny coffee cup on the table has long stood empty, in which he turns to his 14 seasons as a centre-back and things fall into place.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was such a long time ago,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. Yet as Pellegrini recalls his past self, the international who made 500 appearances for Universidad de Chile, there\xe2\x80\x99s a glimpse of the origins that helps make sense of everything he has talked about for the past hour. Not just how he approaches perhaps the biggest game of his Manchester City career, against Barcelona on Wednesday night, and the pressure it brings, but his own personality. The identity that makes Pellegrini the manager he is, not the player he was.</p> <p>Pellegrini, 61, graduated as a civil engineer in Santiago in 1979, six years after his football career began, and he was analytical and intelligent, determined \xe2\x80\x9calways to improve\xe2\x80\x9d, but he describes a defender defined by \xe2\x80\x9caggressiveness\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9ccharacter\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfight\xe2\x80\x9d. If that sounds different to his image now, that\xe2\x80\x99s because it is. It\xe2\x80\x99s also because that\xe2\x80\x99s the way he wanted it. Age has not changed him; Pellegrini took a conscious decision to change himself.</p> <p>That may sometimes draw some to conclude that he is less competitive than he is, perhaps even passive. There are occasional flashes of frustration, a simmering sense that achievements have gone unrecognised, right back to his playing days, and that the debate is skewed to favour more demonstrative managers. But Pellegrini thinks he not only chose the right path, he chose a necessary one. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve changed my character 100%; if not, I could never have become a manager,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAt first, I made decisions based on emotion, when you have to take them calmly. When I made the transition from player to coach I evaluated myself and saw that I needed to improve my personality. I would fight with players \xe2\x80\x93 literally. I was 35 and you can\xe2\x80\x99t be like that; you have young players to guide. You have to transmit calm. It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to slow your heart rate and maybe some see it as a flaw, passivity, but it\xe2\x80\x99s among the best things I\xe2\x80\x99ve done.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s not always possible, of course, and bits of the other Pellegrini remain, like when he angrily accused the Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson of bias after last season\xe2\x80\x99s defeat at the Camp Nou. \xe2\x80\x9cVery few times have I regretted something so much,\xe2\x80\x9d he admits. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re still immersed in the game, you explode. I behaved very badly, I was wrong and, anyway, that [lack of control] is exactly what I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to transmit to my players. I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of changing my character, transmitting calm instead of using other means.</p>     Manuel Pellegrini says he had to change his character 100% to become a manager. Photograph: Joe Toth/BPI/Rex    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re hysterical on the touchline \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x98We have to win or they\xe2\x80\x99ll fire me, arghh!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 then that [anxiety] reaches the players,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini explains, growling his way through the impression of an angry manager. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve no problem battling with a player, showing character; the image people have outside doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always reflect what\xe2\x80\x99s happening inside; and I\xe2\x80\x99ve had confrontations when players don\xe2\x80\x99t have my three non-negotiable qualities: respect, commitment and performance level. But it\xe2\x80\x99s better to convince [than impose], better to be calm.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In the face of the ultimate pressure, the threat of unemployment, keeping calm cannot be easy and Pellegrini can\xe2\x80\x99t be unaware of the potential consequences of failure. After Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s defeat at Burnley, the latest anaemic performance, City trail Chelsea by six points having played a game more. They\xe2\x80\x99ve won three of 11 league games and face Barcelona knowing that by midnight on Wednesday their season could be virtually over. How much is control and how much is conviction is worth pondering but, before the sacking question is even finished, Pellegrini has answered: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s an external perception, which is totally different to how it\xe2\x80\x99s seen on the inside.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Really? \xe2\x80\x9cThis is an absolutely solid project, carried out the right way. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never felt that if I don\xe2\x80\x99t win I\xe2\x80\x99m out.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Smuggled out of stadiums in Argentina, sentenced from the start at Real Madrid, Pellegrini has lived with pressure. \xe2\x80\x9cAny coach who\xe2\x80\x99s managed a big club in Argentina can manage anywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, a smile cracking across his face. \xe2\x80\x9cHere the pressure\xe2\x80\x99s normal; there it\xe2\x80\x99s life and death. In Madrid, it\xe2\x80\x99s more political. But I\xe2\x80\x99ve never felt afraid.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>So nor will you walk away? \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI have no sense whatsoever [that my job\xe2\x80\x99s at risk],\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini continues. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course we want titles but the vision inside is different. We want development, constant improvement. You have to be able to say: \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ve got better.\xe2\x80\x99 Or: \xe2\x80\x98What can we do to be better?\xe2\x80\x99 And it\xe2\x80\x99s not always sack the coach. Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s reinforce the squad or bring in younger players. The way we work matters too. Not just in my case: Roberto [Mancini] didn\xe2\x80\x99t continue, but not because one year he didn\xe2\x80\x99t win anything. It\xe2\x80\x99s not \xe2\x80\x98lose and you\xe2\x80\x99re out\xe2\x80\x99.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t a disastrous year: we\xe2\x80\x99re second in the league, we played badly at the start of the Champions League group phase but then beat Bayern and won in Rome. In the league, there are 27 points left. Last year we were nine points behind Chelsea. We had games in hand, sure, but you have to win them. It\xe2\x80\x99s not impossible for Chelsea to drop six points. [At one stage] last season, they were closer to winning the league than Liverpool.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe Champions League is very important but it can\xe2\x80\x99t be trastornante , it can\xe2\x80\x99t distort everything. One bad game, one mistake, and you\xe2\x80\x99re out. In Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s great era under Ferguson they only won two Champions Leagues, Real Madrid went 32 years without the European Cup \xe2\x80\xa6 and they\xe2\x80\x99re still Real Madrid. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to reach the later rounds but you can\xe2\x80\x99t think that not being there is a disaster, although with this squad you can\xe2\x80\x99t get knocked out in the group.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cCity went from not getting out the group to two years running getting through a group with Bayern and then being unlucky enough to get Barcelona. We can\xe2\x80\x99t let that misfortune change our vision. And if we won it, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be \xe2\x80\x98job done\xe2\x80\x99. We\xe2\x80\x99ve constructed the [Etihad] campus, [the owners] want to develop all areas, to aspire every season. And we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to win the Champions League any way possible, booting the ball up the pitch, cheating \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Todo vale para ganar, as they say. Win by any means. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, actually,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini says. Accusations and conspiracy theories create \xe2\x80\x9cdistrust\xe2\x80\x9d and there\xe2\x80\x99s a commitment to a footballing ideal. \xe2\x80\x9cRespect the game, the fans. You can\xe2\x80\x99t score a goal, shut down, everyone back, kicking the ball away, and win 1-0 ...\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     I would go out tonight...Manchester City fans display a banner aimed at manager Manuel Pellegrini. Photograph: Matt West/BPI/Rex    <p>The Spanish coach Juanma Lillo once said that we value what ends well, not what is done well, symptomatic of a sick society. \xe2\x80\x9cExactly,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini nods.</p> <p>In any case, he adds: \xe2\x80\x9cYou can win it once that way, getting lucky, but repeated success requires foundations, a style. Winning trophies here is important\xc3\xadsmo, an obligation. You can\xe2\x80\x99t finish fifth and just say: \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a [long term] project.\xe2\x80\x99 But we have won: in the last four years this team has won two leagues, come second twice, and won the FA Cup and the Capital One Cup. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s bad. We\xe2\x80\x99ve progressed in the Champions League, too.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>There\xe2\x80\x99s a flash of pride, of vindication for a man who feels that his successes have not always been recognised, even as a player. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can say I was a disaster, say it! But find me another disaster who played 500 games,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a manager I won eight trophies in Chile, Ecuador and Argentina. In Spain, I\xe2\x80\x99d taken Villarreal to league runners-up and the quarter-final and then semi\xe2\x80\x91final of the Champions League. M\xc3\xa1laga finished fourth and reached the quarter-final of the Champions League. At Madrid, we broke the record [reaching 96 points, only for Barcelona to reach 99], but not winning the league was a thorn in my side; the conditions were there, although the atmosphere wasn\xe2\x80\x99t right. My challenge was to join a big European team and win a title without compromising my ideas. We won the Capital One Cup, scored 156 goals, and won the league.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini knows that some see that as the league Liverpool lost, not the league City won. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely unfair, for lots of reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst, we were competing in lots of competitions: we won the Capital One Cup, winning every game; we reached the FA Cup quarter-final; we had the Champions League. Liverpool only had one competition, an enormous advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9c[Steven] Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s slip? They lost 2-0, not 1-0. If they\xe2\x80\x99d drawn that, we\xe2\x80\x99d [still] have been two points ahead. Then they were winning 3-0 [against Crystal Palace] and drew 3-3. When we blew a lead in Cardiff, it was said that the team was bad. Where do people get the idea that they deserved it more? Competitions? We were in more. Goals for? We scored more. Goals against? We conceded fewer. Points? We had two points more and played I-don\xe2\x80\x99t-know-how-many midweek games. I just don\xe2\x80\x99t see it\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Manuel Pellegrini has endured some frustrating moments this season as City struggle to defend their title. Photograph: Matt West/BPI/Rex    <p>This annoys the City manager. \xe2\x80\x9cMuch\xc3\xadsimo,\xe2\x80\x9d he admits. \xe2\x80\x9cI understand that Liverpool are more popular, that they have a great tradition and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t won the title for years, that they have more English players, so people wanted them to win. But we beat them here, and [at Anfield] we lost 3-2 in a game with important refereeing mistakes. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t say anything: we congratulated them and continued. There\xe2\x80\x99s not one footballing reason to say they deserved it more\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>The English angle is interesting. Would you like to sign more Englishmen? \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s important to have English players,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini says, but he has a question of his own: \xe2\x80\x9cCan you sign them? To improve this squad, you\xe2\x80\x99re talking players you can\xe2\x80\x99t get. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say [Luke] Shaw. \xc2\xa335m on a left\xe2\x80\x91back because he\xe2\x80\x99s English? Can you get [Raheem] Sterling from Liverpool? Maybe if you go with \xc2\xa3100m. [Gary] Cahill? Or [Frank] Lampard a few years ago? And if I want an Englishman in [David] Silva\xe2\x80\x99s position, who is there?\xe2\x80\x9d There\xe2\x80\x99s a long pause. \xe2\x80\x9c[Wayne] Rooney? Either they don\xe2\x80\x99t exist or clubs won\xe2\x80\x99t sell.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we won the Capital One Cup with no English players, it was everywhere. Arsenal won the FA Cup [with only Kieran Gibbs in the starting XI] and no-one said anything. Chelsea have two English regulars: [John] Terry and Cahill. United have more but only Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s a [guaranteed] starter. Liverpool do, yes, which is why people wanted them to win the league.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>One Englishman City do have may not be there much longer. \xe2\x80\x9cThe club wants [James] Milner to continue and he wants to stay but maybe he wants more games,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini says of a player who has started only 13 of 29 in the league. \xe2\x80\x9cI understand. I\xe2\x80\x99m Milner\xe2\x80\x99s No1 fan. Find me a more complete English player. There are players who\xe2\x80\x99re better technically, yes. Quicker players, yes. Players who head better, yes. But show me one who does all the things Milner does well. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t one.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to leave him out. Respect, commitment and performance level: 10/10, fantastic. He\xe2\x80\x99s polyfunctional: full-back \xe2\x80\x93 the only position he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like \xe2\x80\x93 attacking midfield, wide. I played him as a forward and the team averaged three goals a game. He gives everything. You leave him on the bench and he\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely furious but watch him during the game: encouraging, shouting, supporting. And in the next training session he kills himself.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMilner\xe2\x80\x99s a phenomenon, a guy with big balls and a heart this big,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini continues, opening out his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cIntelligent, great mentality, one of those players that when you leave him out you\xe2\x80\x99re left with this feeling of injustice; it hurts because he should always play but sometimes you need a technical player with other characteristics. I hope he stays. If he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it will be because there\xe2\x80\x99s an important offer.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Other clubs could certainly afford him. More may be asked of City, their successes belittled by their benefactor, but Pellegrini describes that image too as \xe2\x80\x9ctotally unfair\xe2\x80\x9d, believing some can\xe2\x80\x99t digest their late arrival as a \xe2\x80\x9cbig club\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>He doubts they can truly be called a \xe2\x80\x9cbig club\xe2\x80\x9d yet anyway, portraying City as trying to catch clubs that have been \xe2\x80\x9chuge for years\xe2\x80\x9d and insisting that the gap is not so great.</p>     A man in the crowd \xe2\x80\xa6 Manuel Pellegrini watches his side in action against Crystal Palace at the Etihad Stadium. Photograph: Matt West/BPI/Rex    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis season,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, counting out the teams, \xe2\x80\x9cLiverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United, have all spent much more than us. The squads are absolutely equal. Liverpool have [Philippe] Coutinho, Sterling, [Daniel] Sturridge, Gerrard, last year they had [Luis] Su\xc3\xa1rez and they bought six players this year. If you say \xe2\x80\x98Southampton\xe2\x80\x99, OK. But Tottenham, Liverpool, United, Arsenal, Chelsea, us \xe2\x80\xa6 we can buy who we want and the difference in squads is minimal.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Perhaps, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no escaping the sense of decline and underachievement this year, the lack of the \xe2\x80\x9cprogress\xe2\x80\x9d that Pellegrini signals as City\xe2\x80\x99s true objective. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you say: \xe2\x80\x98Are you content?\xe2\x80\x99 No I\xe2\x80\x99m not,\xe2\x80\x9d he concedes. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not content because we\xe2\x80\x99re not meeting my targets, not because of any [external] debate: \xe2\x80\x98Will he go if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t win?\xe2\x80\x99 But the year\xe2\x80\x99s not over, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to fight for.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The question is why City have declined after winning the league.</p> <p>First, a caveat.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI prefer not to offer reasons, because they sound like excuses and there\xe2\x80\x99s no excuse,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini says. But?</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9c When you win something, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have that mentality that comes from a tradition of always winning, the built-in demands of a big club, there\xe2\x80\x99s always a small dip.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhere we have most slipped is goals. This was the ideal year [to build], [but] with the financial fair play restrictions, not only could we not sign, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t register players. To buy Bony we had to leave Jovetic out [of the European squad]. With those limitations, we strengthened defensively.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe brought Willy Caballero to give Joe Hart competition; Mangala, who\xe2\x80\x99s 23 and will be an important player; Fernando because Javier Garc\xc3\xada wanted to go; Sagna because Micah Richards was always injured. What we didn\xe2\x80\x99t do was sign a crack [superstar].\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Would you have liked to? Pellegrini begins by responding: \xe2\x80\x9cWell, we have [Sergio] Ag\xc3\xbcero \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d but the answer is yes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe way it\xe2\x80\x99s growing, I think this team needs a crack,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, emphasising the point: \xe2\x80\x9cWe need a crack: that gives you a kind of ascendancy, status.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>But with financial fair play, that\xe2\x80\x99s impossible? \xe2\x80\x9cImpossible. I find financial fair play hard to understand. It\xe2\x80\x99s positive if it\xe2\x80\x99s focused on avoiding someone buying a club and leaving it bankrupt, or preventing clubs running up huge debts they can\xe2\x80\x99t meet. But it can\xe2\x80\x99t focus on annual losses: if I have losses for three years but I know my business is going to be healthy in six, if I pay for that and have the guarantees, that\xe2\x80\x99s my business decision. There are clubs with enormous debts; City have zero. Without [temporarily] indebting yourself one year, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to build. Instead of building in six years, it takes 14. Why?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLook,\xe2\x80\x9d he continues, \xe2\x80\x9cI was at M\xc3\xa1laga, a club in debt, so I understand that you have to avoid clubs having unsustainable budgets, accumulating unpaid debts. But preventing you from investing, speculating, is absurd. It\xe2\x80\x99s anti-competitive. In Spain you have clubs making \xe2\x82\xac150m a year [from TV money], while others make \xe2\x82\xac10m. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that affect competition too? Or a shirt sponsor that pays a fortune while another pays less? The intentions are good, but FFP needs serious revision.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>So now what? Will there be a legal challenge? \xe2\x80\x9cThe most important thing for City is that we stay within the limits of FFP, otherwise there\xe2\x80\x99ll be punishment,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini replies, \xe2\x80\x9c[but] there are people who think it\xe2\x80\x99s unjust, fighting [legally] against it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Those are two reasons. When it comes to the Champions League, Pellegrini believes there are more reasons why City\xe2\x80\x99s season is in the balance. The draw is one, of course, but there\xe2\x80\x99s another factor \xe2\x80\x93 also felt by Chelsea in losing to PSG. Timing.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis round is particularly difficult for English teams,\xe2\x80\x9d he explains. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are very demanding months. Because of the number of games, because the intensity in England is very high and the pitches are heavy, you get there in less good shape. Not having a winter break gives other leagues\xe2\x80\x99 teams an advantage.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBoxing Day is non-negotiable, a wonderful tradition, and changing it would be absurd, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t play nine games in December and nine in January. Stop at some point, play fewer games. Instead you have the FA Cup throughout January at the weekends, league games in midweek, playing every three days. It\xe2\x80\x99s a heavy load.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Whatever the reason, this match will probably define City\xe2\x80\x99s season but despite the pressure, Pellegrini is calm and confident. That, at least, is the impression he gives at the start of the conversation, the reasons illuminated an hour later, the rain still falling on the training pitch outside. \xe2\x80\x9cThe starting point is that it is possible to go to Barcelona and win. We have to have that mentality, our mentality,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.</p>     Manuel Pellegrini is thrown into the air by his Manchester City team as they celebrate winning the Premier League trophy. Photograph: Nigel Roddis/Reuters/Corbis    <p>Despite the last two months? Despite the previous meetings with Barcelona? Three games, three defeats, remember. \xe2\x80\x9cBarcelona have a great team, spectacular players. No-one else can put together [Lionel] Messi, Neymar and Su\xc3\xa1rez. Add to that [Sergio] Busquets, Xavi, [Andr\xc3\xa9s] Iniesta, [Gerard] Piqu\xc3\xa9 and [Javier] Mascherano, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not a disgrace to get knocked out, but the results have distorted reality,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve never played at our level against them, for various reasons. Principally, because of the sending-offs.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHere [last season], it was absolutely even. [Mart\xc3\xadn] Demichelis was sent off and a penalty given: 1-0 down, a player fewer for 45 minutes. That distorts the game. We went there and played well, lost 2-1 and had a player sent off towards the end: [Pablo] Zabaleta. Here [this season] we were in our best moment, looking for the equaliser, playing well. We\xe2\x80\x99d made four reasonably clear chances and then [Ga\xc3\xabl] Clichy was sent off with 20 minutes [still] to go.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not questioning the referee,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini adds. \xe2\x80\x9cClichy was rightly sent off, Zabaleta was rightly sent off, Demichelis was outside the area but by two centimetres. It was acceptable. The issue is that we have to resist the pressure when that happens and stop it happening. You can talk tactics and technique but if you go a man down against Barcelona, you\xe2\x80\x99re in a terrible position. It conditions the [whole] tie. It\xe2\x80\x99s important we have the personality to play as we can, 11 against 11.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>When the draw was made Busquets admitted that Barcelona were initially disappointed, but soon concluded that they were facing a side that \xe2\x80\x9clet you play\xe2\x80\x9d. The obvious if simplistic conclusion then is don\xe2\x80\x99t. Not necessarily, Pellegrini argues. Tactical naivety is invariably associated with attacking teams but being defensive can be equally naive and just as likely to fail. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to attack, except last year at home when we approached it differently, trying to stop Barcelona being Barcelona ... and that didn\xe2\x80\x99t work,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini says.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf we just waited deep with 180 minutes to play, they\xe2\x80\x99d create chances and we\xe2\x80\x99re not a team [constructed] to play like that. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t always played as I know we can; if we had done, playing our way, and it still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough, then you can think: \xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s change our style.\xe2\x80\x99 But that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been the case. And our identity is to have a big-team mentality, to go to win. And now losing 2-1, we have to attack.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBarcelona will want a slow game, we\xe2\x80\x99ll want a fast one, but we have to be intelligent. They have no time pressure and the less haste you have, the fewer mistakes you make. We have to avoid being precipitate; we have to be calm. I always say to the players: have a hot heart and a cool head.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
