b'Wojciech Szczesny says he is staying to fight for his Arsenal place'


b'<p>Wojciech Szczesny issued a strong response to speculation over his future by insisting that his relationship with Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger remains positive and that he wants to stay at Arsenal for good.</p> <p>The Polish goalkeeper has been linked with a move away from Arsenal this summer after enduring a difficult season in which he lost his place as Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s No1 to David Ospina and was fined by the club after he was caught smoking in the dressing room following his error-strewn performance in the 2-0 defeat at Southampton on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day.</p> <p>However Wenger maintained his policy of selecting Szczesny in the FA Cup by starting him in Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s 4-0 victory over Aston Villa in the final and afterwards the 25-year-old stated that he had no desire to leave. With Arsenal potentially targeting Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Petr Cech, though, Szczesny could find his opportunities of first-team football further restricted.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou like to speculate but I\xe2\x80\x99m happy where I am,\xe2\x80\x9d Szczesny said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got all the support in the world off the manager, I\xe2\x80\x99ve a fabulous relationship with him, so you can stop the guessing now \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m here for good.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Despite seeing Ospina move above him in the pecking order, Szczesny expressed gratitude to Wenger for standing by him during his spell out of the starting lineup. On the eve of the final, Szczesny was forced to distance himself from critical comments that his father made about Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s manager.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe manager has been very good with me the last couple of months,\xe2\x80\x9d Szczesny said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve not been easy for me, but he\xe2\x80\x99s been terrific for me, he\xe2\x80\x99s showed me all the support in the world and I\xe2\x80\x99m very thankful he let me play in the final. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really get a chance to disappoint today.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
