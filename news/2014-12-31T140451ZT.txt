b'Chelsea 1st  <p>Money to spend</p> <p>Chelsea are poised to sign the Croatia forward Andrej Kramaric for around \xc2\xa37m, loaning him to Vitesse Arnhem for the rest of the season. Otherwise, the plan is to retain what they have in full and plan another wave of strengthening next summer.</p> <p>What\xe2\x80\x99s needed</p> <p>Nothing, really. If Petr Cech did agitate for a move (which is unlikely), they would need a high-quality back-up for Thibaut Courtois. The only other departures would be players currently out on loan, such as Thorgan Hazard, signing permanent deals elsewhere.</p> <p>Who are they after?</p> <p>They have long-term targets, from Paul Pogba to Marco Reus and Anderson Talisca, but are unlikely to make additions unless a deal is simply too good to be true. Dominic Fifield</p> Manchester City 2nd <p>Money to spend</p> <p>City are restricted by Uefa\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa349m net transfer spend limitation due to financial fair play sanctions. However, there is still around \xc2\xa320m available.</p> <p>What\xe2\x80\x99s needed</p> <p>A top-class left-back, central midfielder and striker (to make it four in this department) and a reliable second-choice centre-back.</p> <p>Who are they after?</p> <p>Everton\xe2\x80\x99s Ross Barkley is a target though due to the cash limitation and difficulties in buying him he is one for the summer. They could strengthen the goalscoring ranks if a long-term target becomes available. Swansea City\xe2\x80\x99s Wilfried Bony impressed against City earlier this season and has been linked with a \xc2\xa330m move to the champions. Jamie Jackson</p> Manchester United 3rd <p>Money to spend</p> <p>There is again no upper limit on the amount available to Louis van Gaal so the manager could, if minded to, splurge another \xc2\xa3150m-plus. Yet this is doubtful as United will only add in January if a key target becomes available.</p> <p>What\xe2\x80\x99s needed</p> <p>Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s recent revelation that Rafael da Silva did not make the matchday squad for the 3-0 defeat of Liverpool on merit suggests the manager is keen on a new right-back. Two central defenders and a central midfielder are also required.</p> <p>Who are they after?</p> <p>Borussia Dortmund\xe2\x80\x99s Mats Hummels, Roma\xe2\x80\x99s Kevin Strootman, Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s Nathaniel Clyne and Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s Dani Alves would all do very nicely. Jamie Jackson</p>     Manchester United are interested in the Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s full-back Dani Alves. Photograph: Miquel Llop/Miquel Llop/Cordon Press/Corb    Southampton 4th <p>Money to spend</p> <p>After collecting \xc2\xa388.5m from player sales in the summer, Ronald Koeman has money available if he wants to spend it. Yet Koeman has shown faith in the club\xe2\x80\x99s academy and may continue to give chances to young players.</p> <p>What\xe2\x80\x99s needed</p> <p>The most important thing is hanging on to the influential Morgan Schneiderlin. They are a little reliant on Graziano Pell\xc3\xa8 in attack and could do with more cover for Dusan Tadic and Sadio Man\xc3\xa9.</p> <p>Who are they after?</p> <p>They have already agreed to sign Werder Bremen\xe2\x80\x99s Dutch winger Eljero Elia on loan and could make Ryan Bertrand\xe2\x80\x99s loan move from Chelsea permanent. Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s Andros Townsend is on their radar. Jacob Steinberg</p> Arsenal 5th <p>Money to spend</p> <p>Yes, although according to Ivan Gazidis, \xe2\x80\x9cnowhere near the numbers that are quoted\xe2\x80\x9d, which tend to be around \xc2\xa3100m. The chief executive says that there is a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable amount of cash available\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>What\xe2\x80\x99s needed</p> <p>A central defender and a defensive midfielder. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger promised, at the annual meeting in October, to address the defender issue in January, although he suggested this week that a midfielder was the priority.</p> <p>Who are they after?</p> <p>The Celtic centre-half Virgil van Dijk has been discussed, as has the Ipswich Town left-back Tyrone Mings. Wenger also likes the Newcastle United midfielder Moussa Sissoko. David Hytner</p>     Arsenal have an eye on Ipswich\xe2\x80\x99s highly-rated Tyrone Mings. Photograph: Joe Toth/BPI/Rex    West Ham United 6th <p>Money to spend</p> <p>Sam Allardyce has said that any additions would have to be top-class to break into his side and, in any case, the likelihood is that West Ham would seek to shed players to raise funds.</p> <p>What\xe2\x80\x99s needed</p> <p>Diafra Sakho\xe2\x80\x99s departure to the Africa Cup of Nations could heighten the need for more forward cover but the main priority is ensuring that Winston Reid does not leave. The defender\xe2\x80\x99s contract runs out in the summer.</p> <p>Who are they after?</p> <p>West Ham have been linked with the Sporting Lisbon striker Islam Slimani but that seems unlikely. Instead there could be a focus on trying to make Alex Song\xe2\x80\x99s loan move from Barcelona permanent. Jacob Steinberg</p> Tottenham Hotspur 7th <p>Money to spend</p> <p>Daniel Levy will back Mauricio Pochettino with what the manager wants after a frugal summer and funds could be swelled if the club shift their out-of-favour players \xe2\x80\x93 Paulinho, Mousa Demb\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9, Emmanuel Adebayor, Aaron Lennon and Beno\xc3\xaet Assou-Ekotto.</p> <p>What\xe2\x80\x99s needed</p> <p>A striker with the pace to stretch defences and a genuine left-winger, although Tottenham are always alive to upgrades in any area.</p> <p>Who are they after?</p> <p>They have completed a deal for the right-back DeAndre Yedlin from Seattle Sounders \xe2\x80\x93 which could see Kyle Naughton leave \xe2\x80\x93 while they like Aston Villa\xe2\x80\x99s Fabian Delph. They say they have no interest in West Brom striker Saido Berahino. Stuart James</p> Liverpool 8th <p>Money to spend</p> <p>Fenway Sports Group will make money available to bolster an attempt at Champions League qualification despite their \xc2\xa3117m summer investment. Offloading Fabio Borini and perhaps Mario Balotelli would swell Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 budget.</p> <p>What\xe2\x80\x99s needed</p> <p>Ideally, a new spine to the team. A goalkeeper, defensive midfielder and striker are all required while there is a void at centre-half.</p> <p>Who are they after?</p> <p>Liverpool have told Lille they will pay a bonus to sign Divock Origi in January rather than in the summer for \xc2\xa39.8m as agreed. Chelsea are unlikely to let Petr Cech go so the Genoa goalkeeper Mattia Perin and Sampdoria\xe2\x80\x99s Sergio Romero are possible alternatives. Andy Hunter</p>     Will Mario Balotelli be making a swift exit from Liverpool? Photograph: Clive Brunskill/Getty Images    Swansea City 9th <p>Money to spend</p> <p>Enjoying their best ever Premier League season, Swansea are under no great pressure to make signings. Hard to imagine them spending any more than \xc2\xa35m, depending on outgoings.</p> <p>What\xe2\x80\x99s needed</p> <p>The loan signing of Nelson Oliveira from Benfica \xe2\x80\x93 a deal agreed a little more than a week ago \xe2\x80\x93 means that there is cover for Wilfried Bony, who is off to the Africa Cup of Nations and will remain at the club assuming Swansea do not receive a huge offer. Another left-back to deputise for Neil Taylor is a priority and Swansea would want to bolster their attack if Baf\xc3\xa9timbi Gomis departs to Crystal Palace.</p> <p>Who are they after?</p> <p>Matt Grimes, Exeter\xe2\x80\x99s highly-rated England Under-20 midfielder, is expected to sign for a fee just under \xc2\xa32m. Stuart James</p> Newcastle United 10th <p>Money to spend</p> <p>Not much. It would be no real surprise were Alan Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s successor required to sell before buying.</p> <p>What\xe2\x80\x99s needed</p> <p>A reliable striker with a proven goalscoring record. Quite apart from his on-going knee problems the currently suspended Papiss Ciss\xc3\xa9 is Africa Cup of Nations bound with Senegal and Ayoze P\xc3\xa9rez cannot be expected to shoulder the team\xe2\x80\x99s entire attacking burden. They also could do with keeping the powerful, dynamic France midfielder Moussa Sissoko but Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s standout individual this season is much coveted.</p> <p>Who are they after?</p> <p>Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s Danny Ings. A new manager is still to be appointed but do not bet against another French speaker arriving. Louise Taylor</p>     Newcastle United will be doing their best to hold on to the much coveted Moussa Sissoko. Photograph: Scott Heppell/AP    Stoke City 11th <p>Money to spend</p> <p>Finances are as tight as ever at the Britannia Stadium though there may be a fund of around \xc2\xa310m should a bargain appear. Loan deals, however, are more likely.</p> <p>What\xe2\x80\x99s needed</p> <p>A striker. Twenty-one goals in 19 league games is not the highest return and Mame Diouf\xe2\x80\x99s five in the Premier League is the club\xe2\x80\x99s highest at the season\xe2\x80\x99s halfway mark.</p> <p>Who are they after?</p> <p>Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s Danny Ings is thought to interest Hughes and while his four goals are impressive for a struggling team who are currently second from bottom, he claimed after the Boxing Day 2-2 draw at Manchester City he wants to stay at Turf Moor until the summer, at least, to help their survival bid. Jamie Jackson</p> Everton 12th <p>Money to spend</p> <p>Everton stretched their budget in the summer to land Romelu Lukaku for a record \xc2\xa328m, Gareth Barry on a three-year contract and Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o on a two-year deal so may be reliant on the loan market in January.</p> <p>What\xe2\x80\x99s needed</p> <p>Weak defending and a slow, predictable attack have created a multitude of problems for Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez. The Everton manager needs a quick, creative forward to share the load being carried by Kevin Mirallas.</p> <p>Who are they after?</p> <p>Two of last season\xe2\x80\x99s loanees, Monaco forward Lacina Traor\xc3\xa9 and Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s Gerard Deulofeu, who is currently unhappy at Sevilla, have been linked with a return along with the Barcelona winger Adama Traor\xc3\xa9. Andy Hunter</p> Aston Villa 13th <p>Money to spend</p> <p>Three years ago Randy Lerner smashed Villa\xe2\x80\x99s transfer record when he sanctioned the signing of Darren Bent for a deal rising to \xc2\xa324m. Paul Lambert will do well to get Villa\xe2\x80\x99s owner to part with a third of that sum.</p> <p>What\xe2\x80\x99s needed</p> <p>Keep hold of Fabian Delph and Ron Vlaar for a start, both of whom are out of contract at the end of the season. Thereafter the clues are in the goals scored column: 11 in 19 Premier League matches. What Villa would do for a goalscoring midfielder, some more creativity and a prolific striker.</p> <p>Who are they after?</p> <p>Lambert would like to turn Tom Cleverley\xe2\x80\x99s season-long loan into a permanent deal \xe2\x80\x93 Villa have an option to buy him from Manchester United for \xc2\xa37.5m. Stuart James</p>     Paul Lambert wants Tom Cleverley to stay beyond his season-long loan deal.  Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA    Sunderland 14th <p>Money to spend</p> <p>Limited. Ellis Short, the owner, has spent big on Steven Fletcher, Adam Johnson, Jack Rodwell and Emanuele Giaccherini in past windows and, ideally, would like to see Gus Poyet getting the best out of them while also promoting the odd academy graduate.</p> <p>What\xe2\x80\x99s needed</p> <p>A new striker to replace the surely Jozy Altidore who is likely to leave the club. Goalscoring has become a struggle but Poyet would also like an extra defender. Offloading unwanted squad members such as Cabral is another aim.</p> <p>Who are they after?</p> <p>Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s Danny Ings. Lee Congerton, the sporting director, possesses excellent contacts and will seek quality at bargain prices. Poyet accepts that he may have to wait until late in the window for new arrivals. Louise Taylor</p> Queens Park Rangers 15th <p>Money to spend</p> <p>Nothing lavish, and Harry Redknapp has indicated loan additions are far likelier than permanent deals.</p> <p>What\xe2\x80\x99s needed</p> <p>Three or four more bodies to offer the squad a better depth in quality. A centre-half, some pace and a forward to ease the pressure on Charlie Austin and the injury-prone Bobby Zamora up front.</p> <p>Who are they after?</p> <p>They are looking at wingers to add much-needed speed with West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s Ravel Morrison, who spent time on loan at Loftus Road last season, and Tottenham Hotspur\xe2\x80\x99s Aaron Lennon potential targets. Mauro Z\xc3\xa1rate will join on loan after limited opportunities at Upton Park. Jermain Defoe or Peter Crouch would add bite. Dominic Fifield</p>     Ravel Morrison, who has been on loan at QPR, may be set for a return to Loftus Road. Photograph: Stephen Pond/PA    West Bromwich Albion 16th <p>Money to spend</p> <p>Tony Pulis will have been given assurances that money is available to strengthen a struggling squad but don\xe2\x80\x99t expect Albion to break the bank. A budget of anything more than \xc2\xa310m would be a major surprise, unless Albion decide to cash in on Saido Berahino \xe2\x80\x93 which is possible.</p> <p>What\xe2\x80\x99s needed</p> <p>A proven goalscorer to add a cutting edge and some pace on the flanks \xe2\x80\x93 an area that Albion were looking to address before Pulis came in \xe2\x80\x93 are seen as priorities.</p> <p>Who are they after?</p> <p>Danny Ings, Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s striker, is on Albion\xe2\x80\x99s radar. But they would face competition for a player who is out of contract at the end of the season and it is doubtful he will leave Turf Moor before then. Stuart James</p> Hull City 17th <p>Money to spend</p> <p>After spending \xc2\xa340m net in 2014 Steve Bruce is likely to be asked to make do and mend this window. Any new faces are unlikely to cost top dollar.</p> <p>What\xe2\x80\x99s needed</p> <p>Tom Huddlestone, Curtis Davies et al to recapture last season\xe2\x80\x99s often imperious form, Pablo Hern\xc3\xa1ndez to begin justifying his \xc2\xa310m fee by scoring some goals and a side that appears reasonably strong on paper to stop underachieving. If not relegation looms.</p> <p>Who are they after?</p> <p>The Burnley striker Danny Ings. Pablo Armero, the Colombian former West Ham left-back currently on loan at Milan from Udinese has also been mentioned. Louise Taylor</p> Crystal Palace 18th <p>Money to spend</p> <p>There is money for the new manager to spend, most likely up to \xc2\xa320m, and the squad needs supplementing with quality rather than a complete revamping.</p> <p>What\xe2\x80\x99s needed</p> <p>At least one centre-forward given Palace\xe2\x80\x99s lack of bite this season. A left-back since Joel Ward has been filling in on that side and a defensive midfielder with Mile Jedinak off to the Asia Cup in January.</p> <p>Who are they after?</p> <p>They wanted Ashley Cole from Roma and Ipswich\xe2\x80\x99s Tyrone Mings but may end up with Lille\xe2\x80\x99s Pape Souar\xc3\xa9 for around \xe2\x82\xac3m or Neil Taylor of Swansea. They have asked about Stoke\xe2\x80\x99s Peter Crouch, the Swansea forward Baf\xc3\xa9timbi Gomis and Yaya Sanogo at Arsenal, and could consider Troy Deeney at Watford. There is interest, too, in St\xc3\xa9phane Badji at Brann. Dominic Fifield</p>     Crystal Palace are hoping that Ashley Cole will be interested in swapping Rome for a return to London.  Photograph: Ciambelli/Sipa/Rex    Burnley 19th <p>Money to spend</p> <p>Sean Dyche has been told there is money to spend in Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s bid for survival without the need to sell, although he has one of the smallest budgets in the division.</p> <p>What\xe2\x80\x99s needed</p> <p>The main priority is fending off interest in striker Danny Ings, who is out of contract in the summer, a cut-price option for several rivals but also essential to Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s prospects of staying up. Dyche is also keen to strengthen his options in central midfield and add more experience.</p> <p>Who are they after?</p> <p>Milan\xe2\x80\x99s 30-year-old forward Giampaolo Pazzini and AZ Alkmaar captain Nemanja Gudelj have been linked, while extending Michael Keane\xe2\x80\x99s loan stay from Manchester United is a priority. Andy Hunter</p> Leicester City 20th <p>Money to spend</p> <p>Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s board have backed Nigel Pearson in the transfer market in the past and are expected to do so again as they attempt to claw their way out of trouble.</p> <p>What\xe2\x80\x99s needed</p> <p>More quality in all areas. Leicester are making too many mistakes in defence and they have lacked class in front of goal. They are crying out for a Premier League finisher.</p> <p>Who are they after?</p> <p>Jermain Defoe would be a valuable addition in attack but QPR seems a likelier destination for the former Tottenham striker, so Leicester are looking at. They were keen on signing Andrej Kramaric but the Croatia striker is set to join Chelsea instead before being loaned to Vitesse Arnhem, so it\xe2\x80\x99s back to the drawing board.
