b'Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s Manchester United take direct route on road to nowhere | Barney Ronay'


b'<p>Oh, Manchester United. Come back. Don\xe2\x80\x99t be a stranger. We still remember the good times. On a night that saw Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s team knocked out of the FA Cup by a fluent, resilient Arsenal the footballers currently wearing the red shirts of English football\xe2\x80\x99s most successful team of the last quarter century produced a performance that was surely as ragged and tactically retrograde as anything seen under David Moyes \xe2\x80\x93 and, who knows, quite possibly Ron Atkinson, Tommy Docherty and Frank O\xe2\x80\x99Farrell too.</p> <p>In the final moments here United could be seen launching long passes towards their twin centre-forwards Chris Smalling and Marouane Fellaini. Currently they have won one more match than at the same time under David Moyes, without the distraction of European football, and with \xc2\xa3170m of fresh talent on the books. It\xe2\x80\x99s all about the process, of course. Presumably that\xe2\x80\x99s going to start some time soon.</p> <p>For all that this was a brilliantly entertaining match, played at an English pace and even at times in that old outlaw English style. Wayne Rooney was restored to a more familiar role here as a lone goalscoring centre-forward for a match that carried United\xe2\x80\x99s only remaining chance of a trophy this season. From there he spent much of the opening hour chasing after the flicks, knock-downs and general high pressure muddle of some textbook direct football. Van Gaal is known for his rigorous, academic study of footballing systems. On the evidence presented here he seems to be going through English football chapter by chapter, and is currently stuck in the 1950s on Stan Cullis\xe2\x80\x99s great long-ball Wolves team. Perhaps by the end of the season we can look forward to Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s bearded mavericks phase</p> <p>Even the winning goal in Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 victory, scored by Danny Welbeck midway through the second half was reward for a high energy game of hustle. Antonio Valencia was muddled into a short backpass, allowing Welbeck to sprint through, evade David de Gea and score. It is seven months since Welbeck was allowed to leave by Van Gaal having been deemed below the standards required of this United team. He might have enjoyed making a point in the moment of celebration. In the circumstances a neatly finished goal was quite enough.</p> <p>Beyond the drama this was a more routinely disappointing night for United, who must now focus all their energy on finishing in the Premier League top four. It is by no means a sure thing for this slightly baffling United, a team that remains Manchester United in every aspect \xe2\x80\x93 shirt, stadium, fans, \xe2\x80\x93 but which continues to play like Howard Wilkinson-era Leeds United with a lingering hangover. Here the plan worked at times \xe2\x80\x93 as it should: these are some hugely talented footballers \xe2\x80\x93 with United pressing from halfway and playing a series of lofted passes in behind Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s defence.</p> <p>But even in their best moments there was a reminder of some muddled recent thinking. At a brilliantly boisterous Old Trafford Rooney started as a central striker ahead of Fellaini and \xc3\x81ngel Di Mar\xc3\xada. His equalising goal after Nacho Monreal\xe2\x80\x99s first-half opener was United\xe2\x80\x99s high spot in a period of early possession that was straight and to the point, their first five upfield passes all lofted towards the front men, often from the full-backs in the classic Charles Hughes style.</p> <p>For a while Rooney must have had some reassuring flashbacks to playing with Duncan Ferguson at Everton as United continued to pump the ball towards their own all-elbows frontman and hunt in packs for the knockdowns. Rooney has played in many roles up front down the years: No10, between the lines, in the hole. Here he spent quite a lot of time in what can only be described as The Mixer.</p> <p>At the other end Arsenal had begun with some fluency, looking as they have at times recently like the model of a modern, well-grooved passing team. The opening goal was made by a lovely jinking run into the area by Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and a well-paced stumbling pass to Monreal, who finished neatly. Within four minutes United equalised with a refinement on what had gone before. Once again Di Mar\xc3\xada cut inside. This time Rooney made a run to the front of the six-yard box, the ball was whipped in beautifully and Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s header was decisive. This was surely the moment for United\xe2\x80\x99s tinsel-draped odd-bods and misfits to spring decisively into life, to flex the undoubted muscle behind that \xc2\xa3170m spend. Instead they were an energetic rabble for much of the second half, summed up by a comical but deserved sending-off for Di Mar\xc3\xada, who has simply dropped off a cliff in the last few months, legs still pumping, eyes still fixed on the horizon, all fruitless trapped energy. He remains a genuinely fine player, if not perhaps quite \xc2\xa359m of fine player, stuck within a system that simply doesn\xe2\x80\x99t use his talents as a ball-carrier and incisive runner.</p> <p>From here United face a daunting endgame to the season, with matches against Arsenal, Spurs, Liverpool, Manchester City and Chelsea. If Van Gaal is to bring a successful end to the great noisy high maintenance shemozzle of his first season in England his first task is surely just to take some air out of his team. Or at least to ask this group of expensively sourced talents to play a little more like something resembling Manchester United.</p>  <li>This article was amended on 10 March 2015. It mistakenly stated that Marcos Rojo was muddled into a short backpass that led to the winning goal by Danny Welbeck. Antonio Valencia was the player who got muddled. This has been corrected.</li> '
