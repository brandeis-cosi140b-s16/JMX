b'Football transfer rumours: Stoke\xe2\x80\x99s Ryan Shawcross to Roma?'


b'<p>Eden Hazard isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to feature in popular occasionally semi-humorous regular transfer roundup columns any time soon \xe2\x80\x93 unless you count today \xe2\x80\x93 having agreed a \xc2\xa352m five-year contract that will keep him at Chelsea until the start of the next decade. We\xe2\x80\x99ll miss you, Eden. Also not going anywhere any time soon: Christian Benteke, who had demanded to leave Aston Villa back in 2013 only to change his mind at the last minute \xe2\x80\x93 today he tells the Mirror that the whole thing was \xe2\x80\x9ca mistake\xe2\x80\x9d and that he has \xe2\x80\x9cno regrets about staying\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Now for some transfers that might happen, and Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s 21-year-old centre-back Matija Nastasic is a January target for Schalke and Milan, Manuel Pellegrini having decided he isn\xe2\x80\x99t up to much. Another Premier League centre-back potentially leaving for Italy next month is Ryan Shawcross, on the face of it an unlikely Italophile, but it says here that while Newcastle and Everton are both interested in the player, the team currently leading the chase is Roma.</p> <p>Talking of Roma, their Dutch midfielder Kevin Strootman has already agreed to join Manchester United and with the Italian club now out of the Champions League everyone\xe2\x80\x99s very optimistic \xe2\x80\x93 and by \xe2\x80\x9ceveryone\xe2\x80\x9d we do indeed mean \xe2\x80\x9cat least one tabloid journalist\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 that he can complete a \xc2\xa330m switch to Old Trafford post haste.</p> <p>Still talking of Roma, Ashley Cole isn\xe2\x80\x99t about to flee the Italian capital because he likes it. \xe2\x80\x9cThe facts are that he is not going to leave Italy for a year,\xe2\x80\x9d revealed Neil Warnock, one of the English managers who would quite like him to. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is loving it there. He walks about the town without getting recognised. The press are not shoving cameras in his face, so he is loving it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Still talking of Italy-based players, though no longer of Roma, Milan\xe2\x80\x99s Stephan El Shaarawy might move to England but not quite yet, according to his agent and brother Manuel. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he leaves Milan, I\xe2\x80\x99d like to see him play in England, because the Premier League is a competition that is very attractive,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the end of the season, we will sit down with Milan and judge how the season has gone.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Liverpool are ready to ruin the career of yet another defender, with Celtic\xe2\x80\x99s Virgil van Dijk now popping up on their radar. Tottenham and Arsenal are also interested in the Dutchman but it\xe2\x80\x99s Brendan Rodgers \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9ca certainty to splash the cash again when the transfer window opens,\xe2\x80\x9d assures the Express \xe2\x80\x93 who\xe2\x80\x99s favourite to win this race. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the only one he\xe2\x80\x99s involved in, though, having decided that Fabian Delph has the potential to replace Steven Gerrard in their lineup, and also that he\xe2\x80\x99d be cheap, what with being out of contract in the summer and stuff. And they\xe2\x80\x99ve also been linked in Italy with deals for the Sampdoria goalkeeper Sergio Romero and the Palermo striker Paulo Dybala.</p> <p>The Merseyside-based long-shot title aspirants may also profit from a breakdown in transfer negotiations between Newcastle and Rolando Aarons, whose current deal still has 18 months to run but whose performances this season have attracted the interest of Manchester City and Arsenal, as well as the Anfield-based side. Aarons has apparently been offered a six-year contract with his wages set at a paltry \xc2\xa36,000 a week, which is, a \xe2\x80\x9cToon source\xe2\x80\x9d told the Star, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat you\xe2\x80\x99d expect them to offer someone in the reserve team\xe2\x80\x9d. The cheek of it!</p> <p>Burnley feel they need to add a little Premier League experience to their squad in January. \xe2\x80\x9cWe still take value in young players,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sean Dyche, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we are looking for players who\xe2\x80\x99ve had a feel of the Premier League. We are not necessarily a young group, but we\xe2\x80\x99re quite inexperienced as regards regular Premier League football.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Also looking to get busy when the transfer window opens \xe2\x80\x93 less than two weeks now, actual transfer fans! \xe2\x80\x93 is Neil Warnock, who wants to add at least three players to the Crystal Palace squad. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are thin in midfield and up front,\xe2\x80\x9d he admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are trying to get to January, then give our squad better balance. We\xe2\x80\x99re looking for three players.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>His ambition is almost exactly shared by Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s Garry Monk, who admits \xe2\x80\x9cwe do need those two or three bodies to come in\xe2\x80\x9d and is also happy to reveal precisely which positions he wants those bodies to be able to play in. \xe2\x80\x9cI have talked about a striker, and it could be that we look at a loan with a view to something longer-term,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cFull-back is another one \xe2\x80\xa6 We could look for a player capable of playing on both sides \xe2\x80\xa6 Midfield could be another position we look at, but it has to be the right player.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Outside the Premier League Derby are considering a January bid for Ross McCormack, even though the striker only signed for Fulham in the summer, for a massive \xc2\xa311m. McCormack has so far scored in precisely one game per month, grabbing one goal in August, a couple in September and one in each of October and November \xe2\x80\x93 December\xe2\x80\x99s goal remains pending \xe2\x80\x93 and with Fulham foundering in 14th \xe2\x80\x93 10 points from the Championship\xe2\x80\x99s play-off places, the Rams hope they might be able to tempt him away for a cut-price \xc2\xa36m.</p> <p>And in other essential news, it was revealed today that Wojciech Szczesny\xe2\x80\x99s favourite festive tune is Rockin\xe2\x80\x99 Around the Christmas Tree.</p>'
