b'The Fiver | A kind of vicious circle that ends up with football eating its own tail'


b'BACK TO THE FUTURE PART IV <p>There are times in life when you just know you\xe2\x80\x99re on a hiding to nothing. A game of tennis against Roger Federer, a frame of snooker against Ronnie O\xe2\x80\x99Sullivan, a couple of rounds with Floyd Mayweather, a Purple Tin drinking contest with Weird Uncle Fiver \xe2\x80\xa6 you\xe2\x80\x99re going to come off second best (and, in the case of the last two, in need of medical attention) no matter what you do. So turn up, do the thing, and go home. It\xe2\x80\x99s a maxim that loops in the Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s head on a fairly constant basis. OK, OK, an entirely constant basis. And you\xe2\x80\x99d forgive Brendan Rodgers if he was feeling something similar ahead of tonight\xe2\x80\x99s Big Cup trip to the Bernab\xc3\xa9u.</p> <p>The Liverpool manager is set to rest $tevie Mbe for the game against Real Madrid with the reason being that \xe2\x80\x9cour priorities are the Premier League and [Big Cup] \xe2\x80\xa6 always in that order\xe2\x80\x9d, which is fair enough, though prioritising the Premier League over Big Cup in order to get into Big Cup which you then overlook in favour of the Premier League in order to get into Big Cup which you then overlook in favour of the Premier League in order to get into Big Cup creates a kind of vicious circle that ends up with football eating its own tail and the timeline skewing down into this tangent, in which Biff is corrupt and powerful and married to your mother.</p> <p>How you feel Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 decision will effect the Reds this evening largely comes down to which Gerrard camp you\xe2\x80\x99re in \xe2\x80\x93 the He\xe2\x80\x99s Completely Shot camp or the He\xe2\x80\x99s As Good As He\xe2\x80\x99s Always Been camp (there is also, of course, a third, smaller Yes, He Is As Good As He\xe2\x80\x99s Always Been But He Was Never That Good In The First Place camp, one with slightly ragged tents, very basic outdoor cooking equipment and only three squares of Andrex to share between them). But the Liverpool manager is clearly taking the long view.</p> <p>Rodgers denies he is being in any way pragmatic but there would be no shame in it if he were. Real Madrid haven\xe2\x80\x99t just been beating teams lately, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been devouring them whole, so much so that if Los Blancos were an animal you\xe2\x80\x99d be able to find entire Deportivo La Coru\xc3\xb1a players in its droppings. The chances of a Liverpool win in the Spanish capital this evening are supermodel slim, with or without Gerrard. With that in mind \xe2\x80\x93 and with, say, an away draw in Ludogorets followed by a home win over Basel/Basle/Baarl in their final two group games likely to be enough to see them through anyway \xe2\x80\x93 why not put your 34-year-old captain in cotton wool ahead of Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s weekend visit to Anfield?</p> <p>Arsenal, on the other hand, are sitting pretty thanks to their escapology act in Brussels a fortnight ago. A home win against Anderlecht this evening coupled with anything other than a Galatasaray victory in Dortmund will take the Gunners into the knockout stages. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were expected to be where we are so, at the moment, we have not achieved anything special,\xe2\x80\x9d roared Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, sometimes, just to do your job in your game is important.\xe2\x80\x9d There you are \xe2\x80\x93 turn up, do the thing, and go home.

It\xe2\x80\x99s a good job Maidstone never received a penny of the \xc2\xa311m you paid Fulham for him (or anything from the Cottagers themselves for that matter) otherwise I\xe2\x80\x99m sure you\xe2\x80\x99d be asking for it back\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Tom Atkin.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn response to Iain Naylor and his \xe2\x80\x98inanimate objects thwart the will of humans\xe2\x80\x99 suggestion (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters), there has already been a study done on this by the British Medical Journal into the disappearance of teaspoons.
