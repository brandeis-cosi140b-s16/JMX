b'A-League preview No10: Wellington Phoenix'


b'<p>Guardian writers\xe2\x80\x99 prediction position: 8th</p> <p>Last season\xe2\x80\x99s position: 9th</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the time for a New Zealand side to make a statement.\xe2\x80\x9d So said Wellington Phoenix coach Ernie Merrick at this week\xe2\x80\x99s A-League launch. The tone indicated it was no platitude. So too, the demeanour of one of the A-League\xe2\x80\x99s most experienced \xe2\x80\x93 and underrated \xe2\x80\x93 coaches suggested this year could indeed be a watershed for New Zealand\xe2\x80\x99s only professional club.</p> <p>In what is expected to be the most competitive A-League season yet, Wellington feature on few pundits\xe2\x80\x99 most-favoured lists. And you get the impression Merrick and his charges are comfortable with the fly-under-the-radar-approach. It will make success, should it come, all the sweeter.</p> <p>In seven previous A-League campaigns the club have reached the finals three times, all compacted into a golden run between 2010-12. The less said about their predecessors \xe2\x80\x93 the Auckland-based New Zealand Knights the better.</p> <p>So why should this season be any different for the Phoenix, than their last two since reaching the play-offs under former boss Ricki Herbert? For a start Merrick says the team will be more settled and in-tune with his playing philosophy, following a full season under the two-time championship-winning coach.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNow they fully understand how to play together, because they have been together so long. And now we have got depth. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to have very high quality players sitting on the bench, and that is a huge difference to a coach.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Then there is the playing roster. Merrick believes his side are significantly stronger than last year, be it by way of recruitment, players maturing or returning to full fitness.</p> <p>Heading the list is a Dutch midfielder who Merrick holds in the highest esteem. The fact the exotically-monikered Roly Bonevacia is barely-known in this part of the world is fine with Merrick.</p> <p>The Scottish-born coach waxes lyrical about his new 22-year-old recruit to anyone who will listen. </p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cApparently he gave the ball away a couple of years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d quipped Merrick when asked about the qualities of his new Dutchman schooled by the famed Ajax Amsterdam academy.</p> <p>Bonevacia will be in good company in the centre of the park where there will be a distinct Spanish flavour. Alex Rodriguez has arrived from Tenerife, while Albert Riera is tipped for a massive season from many astute judges.</p> <p>Not that Merrick is necessarily an advocate of Barcelona-style possession statistics meaning everything. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to keep the ball, certainly, but you have to get forward with the ball and into goalscoring positions,\xe2\x80\x9d Merrick says. \xe2\x80\x9cControlling possession around the opposition penalty area is the important statistic.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Throw in the impetus provided by midfielder Michael McGlinchey after a protracted move from Central Coast Mariners, and the Phoenix posses a talented bunch, yet one which has been missed by the headline writers.</p> <p>With the supremely gifted \xe2\x80\x93 albeit enigmatic \xe2\x80\x93 Nathan Burns and Jeremy Brockie in the forward line, fans at Wellington\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCake Tin\xe2\x80\x9d could be in for some fun. It would make a contrast for some occasionally austere past seasons when it came to attacking flair. Getting the best out of the raw talent is perhaps the greatest challenge facing Merrick.</p> <p>There are plenty of other interesting names in the Wellington Phoenix side: Australian-turned-New Zealand international Andrew Durante; U-20 youth international Alex Rufer (nephew of former star All Whites Wynton) and Oceania poster boy, Fijian striker Roy Krishna.</p> <p>It is the perfect time to launch a new era for the New Zealand side. A rejigged national association has appointed a new coach in former Bahrain boss Anthony Hudson (son of former Arsenal, Chelsea and Stoke City midfielder Alan), while New Zealand will host next year\xe2\x80\x99s FIFA U-20 World Cup. The building blocks are in place for the Phoenix, now comes the hard part.</p>'
