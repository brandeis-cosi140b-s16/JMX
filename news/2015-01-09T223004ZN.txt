b'Newcastle cannot let manager vacancy drift, warns John Carver'


b'<p>John Carver has warned Newcastle United\xe2\x80\x99s board they need to make a decision regarding Alan Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s successor soon.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t just let it drift,\xe2\x80\x9d the caretaker manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe dressing room is settled but the longer this goes on it could become unsettled. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in this situation before and it can affect people. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t do something about it, in a short space of time, you can end up drifting. So a decision has to be made \xe2\x80\x93 for everybody\xe2\x80\x99s benefit.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Carver, who takes his team to Chelsea on Saturday, wants the job himself and would be delighted to remain in charge until the end of the season in order to prove his credentials.</p> <p>With Lee Charnley, the club\xe2\x80\x99s managing director, understood to have opened talks with R\xc3\xa9mi Garde regarding the former Lyon coach and Arsenal midfielder taking over at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park that may not happen.</p> <p>With other names on the shortlist including Saint-\xc3\x89tienne\xe2\x80\x99s Christophe Galtier, the former Mainz coach Thomas Tuchel, Ajax\xe2\x80\x99s Frank de Boer and Derby\xe2\x80\x99s Steve McClaren not available until the summer, if at all, difficult decisions must be taken. On Friday bookmakers added to the confusion by slashing the odds on Tim Sherwood \xe2\x80\x93 a name not believed to have been on the list \xe2\x80\x93 taking over. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a circus,\xe2\x80\x9d Carver said.</p> <p>Part of the problem is Newcastle were caught cold by Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s defection to Crystal Palace and had no replacement waiting in the wings. Although the interest in McClaren was genuine, the delay in making a move resulted in the Derby manager deciding his loyalties lay with the Championship club.</p> <p>If the chances of Charnley changing McClaren\xe2\x80\x99s mind in the summer appear remote, others may be much more receptive come June. Carver appreciates the problems but is adamant Mike Ashley, Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s owner cannot let the hiatus continue for much longer.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I had that conversation with Lee where I said: \xe2\x80\x98I want to throw my hat in the ring\xe2\x80\x99, I told him: \xe2\x80\x98You want the right coach but you can\xe2\x80\x99t allow this to go on and on and on,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey understand that. What they\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do, and rightly so, is make a rash decision and say \xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99ll take him.\xe2\x80\x99 They need time to think and I understand that. Lee trusts me to do the job while they can have their thinking time and do their due diligence. I understand that but a decision needs to be made sooner rather than later.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Carver is confident he could be the right man. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not,\xe2\x80\x9d said the former Toronto manager. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got the pro licence. I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with some of the best people in the game \xe2\x80\x93 Kevin Keegan, Kenny Dalglish, Ruud Gullit, Sir Bobby Robson \xe2\x80\x93 top people with different styles of management.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>After his first two games in charge ended in a home draw with Burnley and an FA Cup defeat at Leicester, Carver knows he could do with a victory in the remaining pair of fixtures Charnley has booked him in for. \xe2\x80\x9cNot many teams go to Chelsea and win,\xe2\x80\x9d Carver said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I definitely might have to beat Southampton at home.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Whoever ends up at the helm saw their chances of working with Moussa Sissoko enhanced on Friday when Laurent Blanc, the Paris St-Germain coach, said he was not interested in signing Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s best midfielder.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMoussa Sissoko does not fit the profile we are looking for,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we must not forget we are still subject to the rules of financial fair play.\xe2\x80\x9d Shortly after Blanc spoke to the French media, Sissoko issued a tweet. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a professional player and I stay focused on my team, NUFC,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t listen to rumours.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>PSG had been strongly linked with an attempt to recruit Sissoko this month but now Arsenal appear his only remaining serious suitors. Whether they would meet Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa325m asking price remains a moot point.</p>'
