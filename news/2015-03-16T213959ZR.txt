b'Reading v Bradford City: FA Cup quarter-final replay \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s a small pitch invasion at the Madejski Stadium. A bit of blue smoke floats about the pitch. Reading\xe2\x80\x99s fans are very happy about going to Wembley, it seems. An FA Cup semi-final against Arsenal is theirs to cherish. As for Bradford, their cup run ends in disappointment, but they can hold their heads up high, because it\xe2\x80\x99s been quite the ride for their fans. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a pity that they were overwhelmed tonight. A step too far, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no shame in being beaten by a better team. Anyway that\xe2\x80\x99s all from me. Thanks to all of my three readers tonight. Bye.</p>     Reading fans run onto the pitch after the game. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters  '
