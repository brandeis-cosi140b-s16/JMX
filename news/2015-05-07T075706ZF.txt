b'Football transfer rumours: Paul Pogba to Manchester City for \xc2\xa350m?'


b'<p>This week\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League semi-finals did not have the gravitas of 1792\xe2\x80\x99s famous \xe2\x80\x9cPetticoat Coat\xe2\x80\x9d duel between Lady Almeria Braddock and Mrs Elphinstone, but the stakes were high all the same. Whereas Lady Almeria, aghast at her beauty being described as \xe2\x80\x9cautumnal ... with lilies and roses somewhat faded\xe2\x80\x9d, took up first a pistol and then a sword to defend, like a rather extreme forerunner of Aiyegbeni Yakubu, her assertion that she was not a day over 30 despite reports claiming she was 63, this week\xe2\x80\x99s semi-final were all about one thing: winning the affection of Marco Verratti.</p> <p>It is true. Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Juventus (and European also-rans Chelsea) all covet the Paris Saint-Germain midfielder and are all convinced that whichever one of them lifts the Champions League will conquer his heart. But they are overlooking the fact that the Italian is already in the city of love \xe2\x80\x93 and he continues to insist publicly that he wants to remain there. Meanwhile PSG, either to partner Verratti or replace him, are doing their utmost to lure Paul Pogba, reportedly offering him an annual salary of \xc2\xa312m \xe2\x80\x93 which, bearing in mind that the club has already been hit once by Uefa\xe2\x80\x99s financial fair play rules, suggests they are going to flog Verratti or Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Manchester City have fallen foul of those same rules, but they, too, are courting Pogba and are said to be prepared to offer at least \xc2\xa350m, but they\xe2\x80\x99ll surely not get the world\xe2\x80\x99s most sought-after midfielder for that, will they? Hold on that\xe2\x80\x99s a confusing question: who are we talking about when we say the world\xe2\x80\x99s most sought-after midfielder, Pogba or Verratti?</p> <p>Or Giannelli Imbula? The Marseille anchorman is being eyed up not only by Chelsea, but also both Madrid sides and Bayern Munich. Mostly, however, Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s gaze is trained on several strikers, including Internazionale\xe2\x80\x99s Mauro Icardi, Palermo\xe2\x80\x99s Paulo Dybala, Lyon\xe2\x80\x99s Alexandre Lacazette and Tottenham Hotspur\xe2\x80\x99s Harry Kane. Actually, the Mill just threw in that last one for japes. But you have to admit it would be a good fit, and Chelsea fans singing \xe2\x80\x9cHarry Kane, he\xe2\x80\x99s one of our own\xe2\x80\x9d at White Hart Lane would make for marvellous theatre. Embrace the *narrative, *Spurs fans.</p> <p>Queens Park Rangers\xe2\x80\x99 ringmaster Tony Fernandes has a dream. Whether it is the same dream he had last time and that ended up with him appointing Chris Ramsey as manager and the club getting relegated, it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to say, but for now the signs are that QPR are poised to appoint Real Madrid assistant manager Paul Clement as manager. Again we must stress that this is only happening in Tony Fernandes\xe2\x80\x99 head. Surprisingly, it seems that Fernandes\xe2\x80\x99 head is similar to Mike Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s, as Newcastle are also said to be keen on hiring Clement for next season, given that appointing an assistant with no experience of a top job has proven such a spectacular success this term.</p> <p>Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s chances of popping across London and signing Petr Cech have grown slimmer, as Internazionale and AC Milan are showing an interest in the goalkeeper. Nevermind, Arsene, because Brad Jones looks set to be available for free this summer, as Liverpool prepare to let him go and will instead look to either Fiorentina\xe2\x80\x99s Norberto Neto or Club Brugge\xe2\x80\x99s Matthew Ryan to provide competition for Simon Mignolet.</p>'
