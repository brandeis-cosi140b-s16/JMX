b'Burnley v Manchester City: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s that! Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s first win against City since 1974! And a repeat of the scoreline in the 1973 Charity Shield! That\xe2\x80\x99s a thoroughly deserved victory for the Lancastrians, on the balance of play, though that penalty non-decision right at the end will understandably rankle with City. Burnley are still in the relegation places, but in touch with the rest of the stragglers now. Hope is alive! But City\xe2\x80\x99s title challenge has been plunged into serious trouble. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be eight points plus a game behind Chelsea if Jose Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side beat Southampton tomorrow. Ah well, at least it\xe2\x80\x99ll concentrate the minds for the Barcelona game ...</p>'
