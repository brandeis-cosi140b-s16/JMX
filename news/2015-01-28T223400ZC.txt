b'Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas likely to miss Manchester City game with hamstring injury'


b'<p>Chelsea are braced to be without Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas as well as Diego Costa in Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s top-of-the-table clash with Manchester City, because of the hamstring the Spain midfielder damaged in the Capital One Cup semi-final second leg against Liverpool.</p> <p>F\xc3\xa0bregas was involved in a collision with John Terry early in the second half of the hosts\xe2\x80\x99 1-0 win and was withdrawn after 50 minutes to be replaced by Ramires. Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho had initially suggested his withdrawal was merely precautionary with one eye on the visit of the champions but the Spaniard underwent treatment on Wednesday and is rated highly doubtful for Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League game.</p> <p>His fitness will continue to be monitored over the remainder of the week though the initial prognosis is far from encouraging. His absence would represent a considerable blow given F\xc3\xa0bregas\xe2\x80\x99s hugely positive impact \xe2\x80\x93 as a goal provider \xe2\x80\x93 since returning to English football from Barcelona last summer.</p> <p>Chelsea are already likely to be without Costa, who has scored 17 goals in 19 Premier League appearances since his \xc2\xa332m move from Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid, against City after the Brazilian-born forward was charged with violent conduct after appearing to stamp on Emre Can early in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s win.</p> <p>Of the other Chelsea players hurt on Tuesday, Filipe Lu\xc3\xads succumbed to a calf complaint and is likely to be replaced by C\xc3\xa9sar Azpilicueta against City, while Branislav Ivanovic suffered a badly cut foot but should be fit enough to feature.</p> <p>Didier Drogba is likely to stand in for Costa if the striker chooses not to contest the violent conduct charge or if his appeal is rejected by an independent commission on Friday. At present he will miss the games against City, Aston Villa and Everton.</p>'
