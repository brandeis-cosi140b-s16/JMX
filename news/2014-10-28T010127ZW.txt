b'<p>Wayne Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s participation in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s Manchester derby is in the balance after he was reportedly seen limping at a sponsors\xe2\x80\x99 promotional event at Old Trafford on Monday afternoon.</p> <p>The striker has just served a three-game suspension so, if he does prove unavailable, it would be a major blow to Manchester United, who are unbeaten in four matches as they head to the Etihad Stadium for the 168th meeting with Manchester City.</p> <p>Rooney was able to attend the event along with other first-team players after apparently suffering the problem during training earlier in the day.</p> <p>Sources at United were understood to have been unaware of his potential issue. The United manager, Louis van Gaal, has spoken openly of how United\xe2\x80\x99s commercial demands could impact negatively on his ability to manage the side successfully. So if Rooney has an injury, the Dutchman will hope the striker has not aggravated it by attending the event. As Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s captain, Rooney would have been expected to go straight back into the starting XI as the manager has said his leader has \xe2\x80\x9cspecial privileges\xe2\x80\x9d regarding always being selected.</p> <p>Luke Shaw, speaking before the doubts over Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s fitness emerged, signalled what an important player the 28-year-old is to the team. The left-back said the forward\xe2\x80\x99s return would be a \xe2\x80\x9cmassive boost\xe2\x80\x9d. He added: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something I think he\xe2\x80\x99s looking forward to. You know Wayne \xe2\x80\x93 he hates sitting on the sidelines watching and he\xe2\x80\x99s said that a few times. I\xe2\x80\x99m really looking forward to having him back.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Given that in Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s absence United have been unbeaten, winning once and drawing twice, Van Gaal would remain hopeful of going to the champions and performing well regardless, though an injury to the captain would not be ideal.</p> <p>There may be better news, though, as Van Gaal suggested Radamel Falcao could return to face City after a knock suffered in training ruled him out of Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 1-1 draw with Chelsea at Old Trafford. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll have to wait and see but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the injury is too bad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the manager.</p> <p>Of the draw with Chelsea that came through Robin van Persie\xe2\x80\x99s 94th-minute equaliser, Shaw said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a very important point. I think the whole team showed what it meant to us when we got that goal but we had a lot of chances that maybe if we took them in the earlier stages then maybe we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been looking for that final goal. Maybe we would have kept possession and tried to stop them from scoring. But I am pleased with the goal at the end.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt does a lot for our belief. We knew Chelsea were on the fire at the moment, they haven\xe2\x80\x99t lost this season and from today\xe2\x80\x99s game you can tell why they are good at organisation. They keep their shape very well but we broke them down a few times, especially in the last few minutes and we took that chance.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of prospectively playing in a first Mancunian derby Shaw added: \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s one of the biggest games and next week the Manchester derby, I am going to look forward to that all week. It\xe2\x80\x99s something that every young boy wants to play in and hopefully I will get that chance.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I need to be told about it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve watched it for the past years and I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen how much it means to everyone. It\xe2\x80\x99s something I\xe2\x80\x99m thrilled to be involved in, it\xe2\x80\x99s something I\xe2\x80\x99m going to cherish and look forward to.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEvery game in the Premier League is hard but we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to look forward to it this week. It\xe2\x80\x99s a massive occasion for everyone involved in it. We\xe2\x80\x99re all looking forward to it and we know what we need to do so we just need to focus on that during this week and come out firing on Sunday.</p> <p>Despite being 10 points behind Chelsea Shaw insists United can still challenge for the championship. \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, of course. It\xe2\x80\x99s a long season and we are at the start of it so you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what will happen during the middle of season we just have to keep winning the games coming up there willl be tough games but we know we are good enough to win them,\xe2\x80\x9d the left-back said.</p>'
