b'Football transfer rumours: Arsenal in for Chris Smalling, Dani Alves and Pedro?'


b'<p>Today\xe2\x80\x99s tabloid transfer tittle-tattle has a distinctly Arsenally flavour. And why not, what with Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger set to be handed a bumper \xc2\xa320m transfer kitty in the January transfer window. Although, when you think about it, these days \xc2\xa320m isn\xe2\x80\x99t all that \xe2\x80\x98bumper\xe2\x80\x99 really. Ach, modern football eh?</p> <p>Anyway, let\xe2\x80\x99s start with the bad news for Gunners fans \xe2\x80\x93 dinky Dortmund dazzler Marco Reus has apparently no intention of heading to the Emirates next summer. He wants trophies, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99ll get them with the current FA Cup holders.</p> <p>Another Arsenal target, Sami Khedira, is umming and ahhing over forcing his way out of Real Madrid in January. The midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s contract expires at the end of the season and the uncertainty over his future has the usual suspects \xe2\x80\x93 Manchester United and Chelsea \xe2\x80\x93 on high alert.</p> <p>With his side\xe2\x80\x99s defence as solid as a poorly set batch of butterscotch Angel Delight, reinforcements feature highly on Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s shopping list. Celtic\xe2\x80\x99s Virgil van Dijk, West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s Winston Reid, Aston Villa\xe2\x80\x99s Ron Vlaar and, for some reason, Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s Chris Smalling feature on it.</p> <p>Scouts from the Emirates have been to watch Ipswich left-back Tyrone Mings, and in doing so have earned their Watching A Championship Left-Back badge.</p> <p>And in one of the more out-there lines of speculation, Wenger is also hopeful of bagging the Barcelona duo of Dani Alves and Pedro.</p> <p>In managerial news, Nolberto Solano is in line to become Motherwell manager if a London consortium is successful in taking over the club. And the Daily Star reports that Manuel Pellegrini has until the end of the season to save his job at Manchester City.</p> <p>And Crystal Palace want Celtic\xe2\x80\x99s Scott Brown to boss the Selhurst Park midfield.</p>'
