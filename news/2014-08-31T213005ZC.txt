b'Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Diego Costa splits opinion as well as the Everton defence'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho portrayed Diego Costa as a persecuted innocent. Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez settled for childish. Polarising opinion comes as naturally to the naturalised Spaniard as upsetting, unsettling and punishing defences, although there is no disputing the reason Chelsea have their menace back. In one chaotic, unforgettable encounter, he also demonstrated why Fernando Torres, Romelu Lukaku and Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o have taken their leave from Stamford Bridge.</p> <p>Costa, 25, started and finished the nine-goal spectacle that ended with the look of a rout but was an enthralling, end-to-end and error-strewn contest until the 90th minute. Only when the \xc2\xa332m striker profited from Muhamed Besic\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful first touch as an Everton player, sold Sylvain Distin and Tim Howard a glorious dummy and scored Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s sixth did Mourinho relax.</p> <p>As the late as the 81st minute, when Thibaut Courtois produced a stunning save to tip Kevin Mirallas\xe2\x80\x99s volley on to a post after another incisive Everton attack, there were no guarantees. That would have made it 4-5 and turned Goodison Park into a bear pit. Chelsea, however, always found a quick, emphatic way to put Everton back in their box. The corresponding fixture last season produced a 1-0 win for Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s team and an early but ultimately familiar lament about profligacy from Mourinho. Now, with the creativity of Cesc F\xc3\xa1bregas, Nemanja Matic\xe2\x80\x99s authority in midfield and Costa\xe2\x80\x99s threat, there is a more complete look to Chelsea. Mourinho condemned his team\xe2\x80\x99s defending but thanks to Costa\xe2\x80\x99s acquisition from Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid, Mart\xc3\xadnez was left with graver concerns on that score.</p> <p>It was not only Costa\xe2\x80\x99s third and fourth goals in three Premier League appearances that impressed. His movement broke Everton as a defensive unit from the off, his touch brought Ramires and F\xc3\xa1bregas into the attack and in clearing several corners, plus a perfectly timed challenge on Seamus Coleman in the Chelsea penalty area, he showed defending is not beneath him. The duel with Coleman spilled over into handbags and a booking for the Chelsea striker after he failed to heed a warning from the referee, Jon Moss.</p> <p>Moments later Costa goaded Coleman after the Everton right-back deflected Eden Hazard\xe2\x80\x99s cross into his own net, prompting a furious reaction from Howard, who grabbed the striker, placed his head into C\xc3\xa9sar Azpilicueta but received only a yellow card. The USA international could have seen red for handling outside his area in the 10th minute, with Chelsea two goals ahead, only for the assistant referee Ron Ganfield to inexplicably miss that indiscretion. And the fact that Branislav Ivanovic was offside when he scored Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s second goal. And that Costa was onside when he raced clear after another error by Phil Jagielka shortly before half-time.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDiego is a mature guy,\xe2\x80\x9d claimed Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has played in some very big matches and comes from a situation where this is no pressure for him. Diego is enjoying the nature of this competition. What he is not enjoying is the fact that he comes clean and comes to play football.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe comes to give a spectacle in these three matches but people have been chasing cards for him like they did in this match and, in fact, the referees are moving in this direction too because he has had two yellow cards in three matches, which is hard to understand. He was chased, chased. He is one of, if not the best, player in the Premier League. Normally he would be the player of the month but he has two yellow cards and won\xe2\x80\x99t get it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mart\xc3\xadnez viewed Costa\xe2\x80\x99s behaviour quite differently. \xe2\x80\x9cI know players take time to adapt from Spain and South America but he needs to understand that we are quite unique in our league; we are very honest and quite respectful with each other. He made fun of a disappointing action [Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s own goal]. That\xe2\x80\x99s not a reflection of the class that he has. He\xe2\x80\x99s a top player and has had to fight a lot for what he\xe2\x80\x99s got. I think his career deserves a lot of credit so it\xe2\x80\x99s a real shame when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a childish reaction like that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Aside from the accusations (Costa and Howard continued to shout insults at each other for the rest of the game before embracing on the final whistle) the pandemonium caused by the Chelsea forward, Everton\xe2\x80\x99s dreadful defending but vibrant attacking play, poor refereeing and the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 swagger yielded a contender for game of the season. Costa converted F\xc3\xa1bregas\xe2\x80\x99s fifth assist of the season after only 35 seconds and Ivanovic buried a dubious second before Everton\xe2\x80\x99s impressive response was rewarded when Mirallas headed home Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s cross.</p> <p>The second half was simply ridiculous. Five goals arrived in 10 minutes, with Coleman restoring Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s two-goal advantage, Steven Naismith reducing it within 60 seconds, Matic restoring it four minutes later from 20 yards, the impressive Eto\xe2\x80\x99o steering a fine header into the bottom corner on his debut and Ramires prodding Matic\xe2\x80\x99s through ball into the far corner. Fittingly, the finale came from Costa. \xe2\x80\x9cDiego has started very well,\xe2\x80\x9d said Didier Drogba. \xe2\x80\x9cHe looks special, he\xe2\x80\x99s scoring goals and helping the team. He\xe2\x80\x99s settled right in. He\xe2\x80\x99s started much better than I did.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Man of the match Diego Costa (Chelsea)</p>'
