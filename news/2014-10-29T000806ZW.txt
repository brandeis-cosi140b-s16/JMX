b'<p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis year\xe2\x80\x99s Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or nominees come from just five leagues \xe2\x80\x93 La Liga, the Bundesliga, the Premier League, Ligue 1 and Serie A,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Nick Happel. \xe2\x80\x9cHas there ever been a shortlist taken from fewer leagues? And what year produced the most widely spread shortlist?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The good news for fans of egalitarianism in football is that 2014\xe2\x80\x99s five-division Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or shortlist is a positive league of nations compared with 2010, when only four countries (Spain, Italy, England and Germany) were represented. At least Ligue 1 has come to the party too this time.</p> <p>Far more fun is a trawl through the Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or archives on the ever estimable The Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation site. Between the award\xe2\x80\x99s inception in 1956 and 1989, the number of leagues represented each year dropped below double figures only twice \xe2\x80\x93 in 1966 (England, Portugal, West Germany, Hungary, Soviet Union, Italy, Belgium) and 1982 (Italy, France, West Germany, Soviet Union, Spain, Belgium, Sweden).</p> <p>The high-water-mark, though, came a year after. Perhaps the absence of a major international tournament in 1983 meant the voters had fewer obvious candidates but, whatever the reason, the votes were spread far and wide.</p> <p>Michel Platini of Juventus won the award and Serie A was joined by 15 other leagues on the final leaderboard:</p> <p>Italy Juventus (Michel Platini, Antonio Cabrini, Paolo Rossi, Zbigniew Boniek), AS Roma (Bruno Conti), Milan (Eric Gerets), Lazio (Michael Laudrup), Sampdoria (Liam Brady)</p> <p>England Liverpool (Kenny Dalglish, Ian Rush), Manchester United (Bryan Robson, Norman Whiteside)</p> <p>Denmark Vejle (Allan Simonsen)</p> <p>Scotland Aberdeen (Gordon Strachan)</p> <p>West Germany Hamburg (Felix Magath), Bayern Munich (Jean Marie Pfaff, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, S\xc3\xb8ren Lerby), Werder Bremen (Rudi V\xc3\xb6ller)</p> <p>Soviet Union Spartak Moscow (Rinat Dassaev, Fedor Cherenkov)</p> <p>Holland Ajax (Jesper Olsen), Feyenoord (Ruud Gullit)</p> <p>Portugal Porto (Fernando Gomes), Benfica (Carlos Manuel Santos)</p> <p>Spain Barcelona (Bernd Schuster)</p> <p>Belgium Anderlecht (Frankie Vercauteren, Morten Olsen, Erwin Vandenbergh)</p> <p>France Bordeaux (Alain Giresse), PSG (Safet Susic),</p> <p>Greece Iraklis (Vasilis Hatzipanagis)</p> <p>Sweden Gothenburg (Glenn Hysen)</p> <p>Romania FC Universitatea Craiova (Costica Stefanescu)</p> <p>Bulgaria CSKA Sofia (Stoicho Mladenov)</p> <p>Austria Austria Vienna (Tibor Nyilasi)</p> PLASTIC FANTASTIC <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs Maidstone United have been drawn away to Stevenage in the first round of the FA Cup, we have to wait at least another round to see an FA Cup match being played on an artificial pitch,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Vincent de Kreek. \xe2\x80\x9cHas there ever been an FA Cup match played on an artificial pitch before?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Yes, Vincent, indeed there have. In fact there have been quarter-finals played on synthetical surfaces.</p> <p>Here\xe2\x80\x99s QPR taking on Crystal Palace in 1982 on Loftus Road\xe2\x80\x99s Omniturf monstrosity:</p>            <p>Oldham\xe2\x80\x99s plastic pitch helped them to an FA Cup semi-final in 1990:</p>            <p>And here\xe2\x80\x99s Luton on the plastic fantastic in the 1985-86 sixth round:</p>            OWN-GOAL SOUL <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn the A-League, Brisbane defender James Donachie has scored an own-goal in each of the season\xe2\x80\x99s first two matches,\xe2\x80\x9d cheers Dean Kelly. \xe2\x80\x9cHas this season start ever been replicated or even \xe2\x80\x98bettered\xe2\x80\x99 elsewhere by another unfortunate soul before?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Here\xe2\x80\x99s Nick Orton with the details on an equally impressive feat from Filbert Street: \xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite two own-goals in the first two games of the season but Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s Frank Sinclair scored a 90th-minute own-goal in the opening game of the 1999-2000 season that turned a 1-1 draw at Arsenal into a 2-1 defeat and then in the third game of the season he scored another 90th-minute own-goal that turned a 2-1 home win against Chelsea into a 2-2 draw.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife and I have won international caps for the British Virgin Islands women\xe2\x80\x99s and men\xe2\x80\x99s football teams,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Ian Jamieson back in 2007. \xe2\x80\x9cAre we the only such couple or are there any instances of other married couples getting international caps?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Impressive a feat as it is, Ian, you are not the only members of this exclusive club. For instance, the Portsmouth defender Hermann Hreidarsson and his wife Ragna L\xc3\xb3a Stef\xc3\xa1nsd\xc3\xb3ttir - also a centre-back - both own a fancy collection of Icelandic caps. \xe2\x80\x9cI know some footballers\xe2\x80\x99 wives are not very interested in football but Ragna is different,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the Sun. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know any other footballer who married a player!\xe2\x80\x9d He didn\xe2\x80\x99t look very hard. According to reader Hrafnkell Kristj\xc3\xa1nsson, \xe2\x80\x9cHaraldur Ing\xc3\xb3lfsson, formerly with Akranes (and for a short spell Aberdeen), and his wife J\xc3\xb3n\xc3\xadna V\xc3\xadglundsd\xc3\xb3ttir both played for Iceland between 1992 and 1995.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Staying in Scandinavia, Fredrik Andersson notes that \xe2\x80\x9cboth Hans Eskilsson and Malin Swedberg played for Sweden. She played 78 times for Sweden while he is the less successful in the couple with eight caps. Today they are married with two kids and she is a pundit on Swedish TV.\xe2\x80\x9d And Zimbabwean reader Hurugu Pasvani offers Esrom Nyandoro and his wife Ruth Banda - \xe2\x80\x9cNyandoro has been capped more than 30 times by the Warriors, while his wife, who has since retired from international football, has been capped by the Mighty Warriors more than 15 times.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Another couple who share a collection of caps as well as a conjugal association are the former United States captain Claudio Reyna and his wife Danielle Egan, who has six US caps to her name. And north of the border, the Vancouver Whitecaps\xe2\x80\x99 Alan Douglas writes that \xe2\x80\x9cSteve Kindel and Sara Maglio of the Whitecaps and Canada won four and six caps respectively during their careers\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>However, the highest-profile, nearest-miss example of an international footballing couple must be Ronaldo and Milene Domingues, who first got together after he spotted her on television. The Brazil striker eventually popped the question, while Milene broke the world keepy-uppy record, gave birth to baby Ronald (\xe2\x80\x9cMy wife and I eat a lot at McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s so we chose Ronald,\xe2\x80\x9d explained the toothy one) and was selected for Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s 2003 women\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup campaign. Sadly she never played, the pair divorced and she remains without an international cap to this day.</p> <p>For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive.</p> Can you help? <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLast night against Forest my team Watford fielded a team with no British-born players in the starting line-up: Gomes; Paredes, Ekstrand, Bassong, Pudil; Tozser, Abdi, Munari; Forestieri, Vydra; Ighalo,\xe2\x80\x9d writes James Frankland. \xe2\x80\x9cArsenal famously achieved this a couple of years ago but has there even been a team outside the Premier League that has fielded an entirely non-British starting 11?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIs this the first time a match has ever been delayed by snowball fight?\xe2\x80\x9d wonders Nathan Fisher.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAt the end of Thursday night\xe2\x80\x99s Tottenham v Asteras Tripolis game the Spurs goalkeeper picked up the match ball to keep as he had scored a hat-trick during the game \xe2\x80\x93 the goalkeeper at that point, of course, being Harry Kane, following Hugo Lloris\xe2\x80\x99 rush of blood and subsequent sending-off,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Mark Andrews. \xe2\x80\x9cHas a goalkeeper ever walked off with a hat-trick match ball before?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn today\xe2\x80\x99s Angus derby, Arbroath won 5-1,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Mark Rae. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir third goal was scored by goalkeeper David Crawford with a 75-yard wind-assisted free-kick, then 10 minutes later Montrose goalkeeper Lucas Birnstingl was sent off.
