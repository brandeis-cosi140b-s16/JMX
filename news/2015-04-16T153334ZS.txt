b'<p>LUIS AND LUIZ</p> <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s been a magical 12 months of high achievement for the \xc2\xa350m-rated footballer David Luiz. Last summer, he embarked on a selfless quest to relieve Brazil of the pain of the Maracanazo, which had nagged away at the national consciousness since the 1950 World Cup. And after performing one simple contemporary dance routine in Belo Horizonte, 64 years of pain were washed away in 29 minutes, as approximately 202,000,000 Brazilians completely forgot about Moacir Barbosa, Alcides Ghiggia et al forever, and started to consider another subject altogether, and in some depth too. Job done! Then there was his goal for Paris Saint-Germain against Chelsea, which he celebrated quite wildly, and no wonder, as he had joined the highly select and illustrious band to have achieved this feat in recent times against the parsimonious Londoners, lining up alongside the likes of Jon Stead, Ahmed Elmohamady and Ben Mee. And then \xe2\x80\xa6 well, that\xe2\x80\x99s about it. But that\xe2\x80\x99s some top-class success right there! Some real good achieving.</p> <p>But the crazy run of triumph couldn\xe2\x80\x99t last. Something had to give. And last night disaster struck in PSG\xe2\x80\x99s Big Cup quarter-final against Barcelona. David Luiz opted to spend the evening running around with his legs splayed so wide he would make Ian Brown from the Stone Roses look like a ballet dancer mid-pirouette. This bandy opportunity was soon clocked by the wily Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez, who slipped the ball between David Luiz\xe2\x80\x99s legs on two separate occasions, each humiliation the precursor to a stunning goal. \xe2\x80\x9cI had to nutmeg [him] twice because there was nothing else I could do, it was the last option for me,\xe2\x80\x9d shrugged Su\xc3\xa1rez, a cheeky grin playing across his face, almost as though folk from Uruguay really, really, really get off on making Brazilians look extremely daft.</p> <p>David Luiz can at least take heart from the support he received from his mother, who should have taken a deep breath and shut down the computer, but instead posted the following ramble on Instagram: \xe2\x80\x9cI have a son and I always will! His head held high, with a ball at his feet. God knows everything! Jesus is fighting for us until this day and yet we still have people who judge! Who are we to judge you! I will always love you after the good games, and even more after those that don\xe2\x80\x99t go well!\xe2\x80\x9d He will also have been buoyed by the hearty cheer he received from the Parc des Princes faithful, although that, signally, was only heard when he trotted on to the pitch, and not when he left it, two balls and one tail between his legs later. But a cheer is a cheer is a cheer, and it\xe2\x80\x99s probably best to concentrate on the positives regarding this one.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Scott Murray from 8.05pm BST for MBM coverage of Wolfsburg 3-1 Rafa\xe2\x80\x99s Rag-tag Neapolitans.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>2 January 2014: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a fantastic challenge.
