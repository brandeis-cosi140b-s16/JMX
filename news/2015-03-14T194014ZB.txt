b'<p>Burnley have Sunderland in their sights after this deserved win, and quite possibly Hull City and Everton too. Sean Dyche\xe2\x80\x99s side were unable to climb out of the bottom three with victory over Manchester City, but are now just a point behind the side in 17th and in no danger of changing their manager. City will now be officially concentrating on making progress in Europe, where they must overcome a 2-1 deficit from the first leg to survive at Camp Nou on Wednesday. In truth this was such a lethargic, uninspired display from the visitors it was tempting to suppose they had already made that decision before kick-off.</p> <p>Take nothing away from Burnley, though. They were as tenacious as they have been all season and when they finally realised they had an opportunity against City they took their chance, seized the lead and defended it well.</p>  <p> Related: Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Manuel Pellegrini won\xe2\x80\x99t concede title after Burnley loss </p>   <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to improve,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel Pellegrini said, stating the obvious. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not a good day for us, Burnley only created one chance and it won them the game. We needed to create more.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Vincent Kompany was restored to the City lineup after missing the last game against Leicester, but there was no place for Wilfried Bony with Edin Dzeko starting alongside Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero. Both teams matched each other in the midfield areas for the first half hour without managing to create anything likely to lead to a goal. Jes\xc3\xbas Navas made a couple of promising runs down the right but could not come up with the cross his team-mates were looking for while, apart from an optimistic Danny Ings appeal for a penalty for handball, most of Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s moves broke down even further from the area.</p> <p>One could understand City\xe2\x80\x99s caution with Barcelona to come, though as Dyche was at pains to point out in the match programme, Burnley now need to turn good performances into points, for praise for their attitude and commitment will not keep them in the division. The home side had no need to be in awe of their visitors, having earned a point in a 2-2 draw at the Etihad in December, and really should have been having a go to test whether City were keeping something in reserve.</p> <p>It took half an hour for either goalkeeper to be called on to make a save, then Tom Heaton had to produce two in quick succession to deny Dzeko and Ag\xc3\xbcero. Scott Arfield brought Joe Hart into action at the other end before City squandered the best opportunity of the first half. A goal appeared certain when David Silva, already in a good position to shoot, craftily slipped the ball forward for Dzeko to make sure, only for the striker to let the ball run and miss his chance.</p> <p>Ag\xc3\xbcero tried to retreive the situation \xe2\x80\x93 proof that City had more than enough finishers on hand to take advantage of momentary Burnley disarray \xe2\x80\x93 though, forced away from goal, he shot from a narrow angle and missed the target.</p> <p>A Manchester City fan proposed to his Burnley supporting girlfriend on the pitch at half-time, in what looked suspiciously like a pre-arranged stunt but was nevertheless more entertaining than anything the first 45 minutes had offered. The lady said yes, and the crowd responded with a burst of: \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The prospective bridegroom pushed his luck by tipping City to win, though the visitors could have taken the lead shortly after the interval when Ag\xc3\xbcero turned Kieran Trippier on the halfway line but delayed his pass to an unmarked Silva a fraction too long.</p>  <p> Related: Arsenal 3-0 West Ham United | Premier League match report </p>   <p>Burnley showed more attacking adventure in the second half and George Boyd fired narrowly wide with a difficult volley from the edge of the area before Ben Mee was slightly harshly booked for a challenge on Navas. It was nothing like as bad as the challenge by Mart\xc3\xadn Demichelis on Ings that quite rightly led to the Argentinian defender being cautioned a couple of minutes later and contributed to Burnley taking the lead. From the free-kick, angled into the area by Trippier, Kompany\xe2\x80\x99s clearing header only found Boyd on the edge of the area and the winger drilled a low left-footed shot straight and true into Hart\xe2\x80\x99s bottom left corner.</p> <p>The goalkeeper was possibly unsighted at first as the penalty area was crowded, though Boyd did well to keep the shot down and pick the one spot that Hart might not have been able to reach anyway.</p> <p>City wasted no time in bringing Bony on after that, withdrawing the ineffective Dzeko. Stevan Jovetic and, soon after, Frank Lampard also joined the fray, yet the closest City came was an Ag\xc3\xbcero header that flew just too high. Mee was lucky to get away with bringing down Pablo Zabaleta in the penalty area in stoppage time. While not the most obvious foul, he did not seem to get much of the ball, but the referee waved play on and Burnley held on for a famous victory.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about time something went our way after all the misfortunes we\xe2\x80\x99ve had this season,\xe2\x80\x9d Dyche said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone could question we showed the desire to win the game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
