b'Didier Drogba predicts difficulties for Frank Lampard against Chelsea'


b'<p>Didier Drogba says that Frank Lampard \xe2\x80\x9cbelongs to Chelsea\xe2\x80\x9d, even though the midfielder will wear Manchester City colours and stand against the London club at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.</p> <p>Drogba, who rejoined Chelsea in the summer on a free transfer from Galatasaray, played alongside Lampard at Stamford Bridge for eight seasons.</p> <p>It will be curious for Drogba to see his friend in opposition to him, especially in non-Chelsea colours and he knows that it might be difficult for Lampard, who is on loan at City from New York City, having been released by Chelsea at the end of last season.</p> <p>Drogba played against Chelsea for Galatasaray in both legs of the Champions League first knockout round last season and he found the tie at Stamford Bridge particularly emotional. But Drogba says that Lampard will be given a hero\xe2\x80\x99s reception by Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s travelling fans, if he features, and he knows that the player\xe2\x80\x99s legacy is assured.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe supporters know what he gave for the club,\xe2\x80\x9d Drogba said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I know, for sure, the reaction will be good. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what team he is playing for now, he belongs to us. He is a Chelsea player. For what he did. He\xe2\x80\x99s part of the history of this club.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see him, to see my partner-in-crime. It\xe2\x80\x99s a pity that I\xe2\x80\x99ve come back and he\xe2\x80\x99s not here any more. But I know for sure I will be happy to see him again. I played against Chelsea last season so I know it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be difficult [for Lampard]. But I also know Frank. He will do his best.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Drogba made the first start of his second spell at Chelsea in the 1-1 Champions League draw against Schalke at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night. He looked rusty and he says that he will need time to generate form and momentum. On the plus side, he said it was a relief to play \xe2\x80\x9cwithout pain\xe2\x80\x9d after recent struggles with an ankle problem.</p> <p>Drogba\xe2\x80\x99s role at Chelsea is slightly different this time out, as he is also a mentor to the club\xe2\x80\x99s younger players, including the \xc2\xa332m signing from Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid, Diego Costa, who has seven goals in four Premier League games. There are similarities between the strikers, in terms of their physical style and their personal stories. Both of them arrived relatively late at the highest level.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe is very good,\xe2\x80\x9d Drogba said. \xe2\x80\x9cFor him to start the season in England, coming from Spain, which is a very different league and to recreate the same thing he was doing at Atl\xc3\xa9tico, is fantastic. He\xe2\x80\x99s enjoying playing here and being with us, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the best feeling he could have. He\xe2\x80\x99s the striker we needed this season. I can see his desire to win every challenge and to score goals. He\xe2\x80\x99s hungry for goals and that\xe2\x80\x99s the best thing for a team like us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
