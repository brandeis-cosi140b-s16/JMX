b'<p>Mario Balotelli may have scored for Liverpool on Tuesday night \xe2\x80\x93 only his second competitive goal this season \xe2\x80\x93 but questions still remain about his suitability to Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 side and how and why the \xc2\xa316m Italian striker with a troubled past ended up at Anfield.</p> <p>As Tottenham could have told Rodgers, replacing a world-class player is no easy task, especially if you\xe2\x80\x99re not a club with the stature of Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, Chelsea or the like.</p> <p>So to fill the gaping hole left by Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez\xe2\x80\x99s departure for Barcelona in the summer and remain competitive was always going to be a challenge for Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s situation, not helped by the fact that like-for-like replacements were few and far between, as Spurs found to their cost since losing Gareth Bale to Real Madrid the previous season.</p> <p>Possibly the only player available who could have come close to replacing Su\xc3\xa1rez \xe2\x80\x93 considering that the only other forwards who play with anything like the Uruguayan\xe2\x80\x99s exceptionally high intensity and rhythm, Diego Costa and Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero, were already taken \xe2\x80\x93 was Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez but, although Liverpool were reportedly interested, he chose to go elsewhere and signed for Arsenal.</p> <p>Instead, Liverpool opted for a variety of attacking players who on paper brought different skills to the squad, hoping the improved options would make up for not being able to directly replace Su\xc3\xa1rez.</p> <p>With the promise of Lazar Markovic, the physicality and centre-forward presence of Rickie Lambert and the industry and versatility of Adam Lallana \xe2\x80\x93 added to Daniel Sturridge, Raheem Sterling, Philippe Coutinho and Fabio Borini \xe2\x80\x93 Rodgers must have felt he had assembled an attacking line-up that could still press for a top-three position. So why then, with so many attacking options, did Liverpool feel the need to sign Balotelli?</p> <p>We don\xe2\x80\x99t know who pushed for the signing \xe2\x80\x93 whether it was Rodgers, the board or whoever else \xe2\x80\x93 but it is rather puzzling that Rodgers, whose approach to coaching and attacking schemes are based on collective, fluid movement and cohesion (and who probably puts in the most hours of any Premier League manager on the training ground to organise his attacking game), should sign a player whose game is often dependent on his mood, is regularly accused of playing only for himself rather than the team and whose industry and movement is the polar opposite of Su\xc3\xa1rez\xe2\x80\x99s.</p> <p>Aside from the technical aspect, strategically the signing also seems completely at odds with the way Liverpool have operated in the Fenway Sports Group era.</p> <p>Admired for their approach to the transfer market, the American owners\xe2\x80\x99 principles are rooted in thorough scouting, detailed analysis and even the considerations of a transfer committee.</p> <p>Having invested heavily in scouting they have established a good reputation, not least because they lured away several of Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s scouting team.</p> <p>Described as the best of both worlds, having a mix of data-based analytics and traditional scouts who work closely with Rodgers, they will also have known of and thoroughly assessed the other newly arrived forwards who have made an early impact in the Premier League this season, such as Graziano Pell\xc3\xa8 (at Southampton), Diafra Sakho (West Ham) or Abel Hern\xc3\xa1ndez (Hull), and dismissed them as either not being suitable tactically or no improvement on their current squad.</p> <p>Anfield\xe2\x80\x99s scouting staff would also have kept close tabs on two other strikers who moved clubs this summer for fees close to the \xc2\xa320m mark yet have struggled to impress despite their undoubted ability.</p> <p>The much-touted young Real Madrid talent Alvaro Morata signed for Juventus but is still finding his feet in Serie A, while Ciro Immobile, currently one of the forwards keeping Balotelli out of the Italy squad, moved from Torino to Borussia Dortmund but has not settled either. He was also replacing a key player in Robert Lewandowski, and Dortmund had known for a year that he would be going to Bayern Munich so had ample time to research his successor, proving that you can only do so much in projecting how players are going to fit in; it can take longer than you thought and shows that even \xc2\xa320m signings do not guarantee instant impact.</p> <p>As to Balotelli making an impression at Anfield, some have already started to view his acquisition as something of a vanity project rather than a sound, strategic signing.</p> <p>Although it is hard to imagine that Liverpool felt displeased with their squad in early August \xe2\x80\x93 highlighted by the fact that they did not press harder for \xc2\xa310m signing Divock Origi to join immediately from Lille \xe2\x80\x93 one can only assume that there was still a slot open for the arrival of a marquee signing, an exciting addition, knowing that sometimes opportunities open up towards the end of the transfer market.</p> <p>When Balotelli was made available by Milan, especially at what seemed a reasonable price, the temptation was clearly too strong to ignore. His extravagant personality and colourful behaviour excited the supporters and made it a popular decision at the time \xe2\x80\x93 even at the risk of such a blockbuster signing facing the impossible fate of being unfairly compared with Su\xc3\xa1rez.</p> <p>Even though Markovic and Lallana cost more than Balotelli in transfer fees, the Italian \xe2\x80\x93 accustomed to the pressure from a career spent only at top clubs \xe2\x80\x93 was never going to be allowed the same time to settle at Anfield or to assume a role as an impact substitute or a bit-part player.</p> <p>Though the signing went contrary to Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s way of doing things under FSG and seemingly threw their considered, analytical processes out of the window, Balotelli\xe2\x80\x99s status and undoubted (yet mercurial) individual talent made them feel it was a gamble worth taking.</p> <p>Presumably their hope was that at 24, the Italian would begin to mature, and take the chance to repay such an illustrious club by starting to impose a more responsible and collective approach to his game. They obviously believed he could adapt to them rather than the other way round (an indulgence accorded only to the likes of a Ronaldo, Messi, or, perhaps, a Su\xc3\xa1rez) and put their faith in Rodgers to make it happen.</p> <p>Perhaps, however, as Liverpool are now discovering to their cost, it is to be expected that if you abandon your principles and processes to temptation you will have to endure a rocky ride.</p>'
