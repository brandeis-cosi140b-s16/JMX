b'John Terry ready to join Eden Hazard in extending his spell at Chelsea'


b'<p>John Terry is confident he will prolong his Chelsea career into an 18th season as the team\xe2\x80\x99s captain awaits formal talks with the Premier League leaders\xe2\x80\x99 hierarchy over a new one-year deal at Stamford Bridge.</p> <p>The centre-half is one of only three players at the club, alongside Eden Hazard and Branislav Ivanovic, to have started all of the side\xe2\x80\x99s league games to date this term. Terry signed a new one-year contract last summer, having long since accepted Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s policy of awarding 12-month extensions to players over 30, with the 34-year-old content to wait until the end of the season before securing his next new deal.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe club know my position, hopefully I know theirs and it will get done,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNo talks have happened yet between myself and the club, but we both respect each other\xe2\x80\x99s position. There are more important players here. Hazard\xe2\x80\x99s one.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFor me, [securing him to a new contract until 2020] was the most important for the club. Without anyone telling me that, I knew that was the first priority for them. Hopefully they\xe2\x80\x99ll be knocking on the door soon.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll be happy with one more year and then we\xe2\x80\x99ll see how we go year by year. I\xe2\x80\x99ve not got much choice. The first year [when his last long-term deal was running down] I was maybe a bit nervous and edgy and hoping and knocking on their door myself. But we had a good chat. I know their position and they know mine. I want to stay and hopefully my performances are showing that and they want to keep me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has already gone on record to confirm there are \xe2\x80\x9cno doubts\xe2\x80\x9d Terry will be granted a new deal. The Portuguese and his medical staff have devised specific training regimes to offer the captain his best opportunity to feature regularly, with Terry granted a few days\xe2\x80\x99 leave before the hectic Christmas schedule to ensure he maintained his fitness.</p> <p>The player himself is reluctant to spend any time on the sidelines as he seeks a fourth Premier League title. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to [rest],\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of pressure. I\xe2\x80\x99m coming to the end of my career, so it\xe2\x80\x99s important I stay fit and play as much as I can. It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult when you see young boys come in like Kurt [Zouma]. He\xe2\x80\x99s been a revelation since he came in: he\xe2\x80\x99s young, fit, strong and hungry and it makes it even more difficult.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen Gary Cahill plays he\xe2\x80\x99s been great, and when Kurt plays he\xe2\x80\x99s been great, so it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get the balance but we\xe2\x80\x99re all rotating and there\xe2\x80\x99s enough games to share around. We all want to play every game. They\xe2\x80\x99re fighting it out and it could be me any time. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to remain top of the league and everyone gets their game time.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
