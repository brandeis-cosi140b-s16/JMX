b'David Luiz says he turned down new Chelsea contract to join PSG'


b'<p>David Luiz has said he has no regrets about leaving Chelsea for Paris Saint\xe2\x80\x91Germain and that he turned down a new contract at Stamford Bridge to join Laurent Blanc\xe2\x80\x99s team.</p> <p>The Brazilian ended a two-and-a-half-year stay in London on 13 June when he signed for PSG for \xc2\xa350m, a world record fee for a defender. While his new side beat Barcelona in the Champions League last week, their start to the domestic season has been unspectacular \xe2\x80\x93 especially in the context of events across the English Channel, where David Luiz\xe2\x80\x99s old team-mates have taken a five-point lead at the top of the Premier League table.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI made my choice and I\xe2\x80\x99m happy with my choice,\xe2\x80\x9d he said after a 1-1 draw with Monaco that left PSG seven points behind the Ligue 1 leaders, Marseille. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m happy to see my friends at Chelsea playing very well, and I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to be here.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing very well for many, many years. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to finish well, not just the beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho said after David Luiz\xe2\x80\x99s departure that the player would not be missed in a squad that was well stocked for options at centre-back and in his secondary position as a defensive midfielder. But, rather than being ushered out of the door, David Luiz says that the club had sought to retain his services for longer.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cChelsea offered me a new contract to stay but it was my choice to come here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was happy with the plan PSG offered to me and I think it was exactly the right moment to move. I was so happy at Chelsea \xe2\x80\x93 I won two titles, I won another title for the FA Cup, so it was great for me.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a lucky guy. I was playing for a big club in Chelsea and now I\xe2\x80\x99ve got another opportunity to play for a big club.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Aspects of David Luiz\xe2\x80\x99s performance against Monaco will have been familiar to Chelsea fans. Twice he was dispossessed in dangerous areas when attempting a characteristic sortie upfield; against that, one tackle on a goalbound Lucas Ocampos was a masterpiece of timing and precision. He and his team-mates will require greater consistency to retain their league title, but he believes they can go one better and win the Champions League.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOf course \xe2\x80\x93 this is the plan we have,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a great, great coach and it\xe2\x80\x99s a great club. It\xe2\x80\x99s so difficult to win the Champions League \xe2\x80\x93 you have to win game by game. You need to qualify first if you want to win.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ligue 1 has been criticised for lacking depth and tempo beneath its top clubs, but David Luiz believes he is playing at a standard comparable to that of the English league. \xe2\x80\x9cI think here the level is high as well. You can see many teams are playing very well. Of course it\xe2\x80\x99s a bit different about the intensity and the style they play. Here it is more quality than physical.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
