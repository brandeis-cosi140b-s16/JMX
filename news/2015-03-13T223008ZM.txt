b'Manuel Pellegrini plays down Vincent Kompany\xe2\x80\x99s clash with Fernandinho'


b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini has played down reports of a dressing-room fight between Vincent Kompany and Fernandinho after the defeat at Liverpool two weeks ago and insisted the spirit in the Manchester City squad is harmonious.</p> <p>The City manager did not deny the pair had a heated exchange at Anfield, but said it was normal and quickly forgotten. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is not any problem within the dressing room,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is normal to have a discussion if two players think differently but this happened two weeks ago. If you were telling me this happened yesterday I might be concerned but it is in the past and it was nothing in the first place.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>City are unlikely to underestimate Burnley when they visit Turf Moor on Saturday evening. When Sean Dyche\xe2\x80\x99s side came to the Etihad at Christmas they went two goals behind then fought back for a 2-2 draw. That brought City\xe2\x80\x99s seven-match winning run in the league to an end and some would argue the defending champions have not been the same since. They are now five points behind Chelsea, who have a game in hand, with little room for further slip-ups. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know Burnley are a very good team,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we also know that it is a big mistake to think the game is over if you are winning 2-0. We have two away games in the next few days and neither will be easy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Barcelona are City\xe2\x80\x99s opponents on Wednesday in the Champions League. Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s side have a 2-1 deficit to make up from the first leg, though the manager does not feel a late kick-off the previous Saturday will be a factor. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think a few hours will make an important difference, the main thing is we play Saturday and Wednesday,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is a lot better than Saturday to Tuesday. Sometimes you feel the league could do more to help teams playing in Europe, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that is the biggest difficulty English teams face. More important in my opinion is the number of games English teams have to play in December and January. I am not talking about Boxing Day, I know we need to keep that, but playing so often in the winter months leaves you tired.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>With Chelsea in the driving seat in the Premier League and City showing no signs of overcoming their inferiority complex against Barcelona, speculation is rife that this may be Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s last season in Manchester and he is already being linked with the position Rafa Ben\xc3\xadtez will shortly vacate at Napoli.</p> <p>The manager denied a trophyless season would automatically mean the exit door. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it will be all about whether we win the league title,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs far as I am concerned I am here until June 2016 and I intend to finish my contract. I am happy here, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any problems, and I always try to complete my contracts.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
