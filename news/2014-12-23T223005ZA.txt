b'Alan Pardew looks for striker while Papiss Ciss\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s knee problem persists'


b'<p>Alan Pardew travels to Old Trafford on Boxing Day hoping Newcastle United can disguise the fact they are a \xe2\x80\x9cstriker light\xe2\x80\x9d.Although his side have beaten Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool this season, Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s home defeat by Sunderland highlighted their shortage of attacking artillery.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe need another striker in January if we can get one,\xe2\x80\x9d said their manager, who is concerned about Papiss Ciss\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s continuing knee problems in the wake of the Senegal forward undergoing surgery last April. \xe2\x80\x9cPapiss is still not right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pardew, currently restricted to using Ciss\xc3\xa9 in brief cameo appearances from the bench. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can see that in the way he moves and that\xe2\x80\x99s something we need to look at. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he needs more surgery on his knee but he\xe2\x80\x99s not quite right.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>With Facundo Ferreyra having failed to impress since arriving on loan from Shakhtar Donetsk, Newcastle have been overdependent on Ayoze P\xc3\xa9rez, a former Tenerife striker originally destined for Peter Beardsley\xe2\x80\x99s development squad. Instead the \xc2\xa31.5m import has been a revelation, scoring four Premier League goals in 16 largely impressive appearances. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have been absolutely reliant on Ayoze P\xc3\xa9rez,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pardew. \xe2\x80\x9cI said at the start of the season we were a striker light and we really needed someone to come through and help us. Ayoze has done that. He was already technically accomplished when he arrived but his physical improvement has been immense. He did a couple of tricks against Sunderland I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody on the pitch could have produced. He\xe2\x80\x99s got a wiry strength and his feet are so fast he\xe2\x80\x99s been a real asset.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Regardless of whether or not another forward arrives to ease the burden on P\xc3\xa9rez, the end of January should see the return of Siem de Jong following a thigh operation. The former Ajax playmaker, a classic No10, was Pardew\xe2\x80\x99s marquee \xc2\xa36m summer signing, not to mention a proven goalscorer, and he has been much missed.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI looked at Siem with adoring eyes this morning because, in those games with packed defences, with him and P\xc3\xa9rez in the team we\xe2\x80\x99ll unlock anyone,\xe2\x80\x9d said Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s manager. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we\xe2\x80\x99ve still got big hurdles to overcome with Siem, his first training session, his first hit on the thigh but he\xe2\x80\x99s running and his progress is good. He feels good. The surgeon says the signs are very good.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at the end of January for having Siem back in that No10 role which is massively important in the Premier League. It\xe2\x80\x99s a position that can dictate the game. Yohan Cabaye used to do that for us from the No10 position and, although Moussa Sissoko can impact games from it, Siem is more like Cabaye and will help us control games.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pardew will be further boosted by Tim Krul\xe2\x80\x99s expected return on 10 January from injury, ahead of schedule, at Chelsea, thereby relieving the pressure on Jak Alnwick, Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s inexperienced third-choice goalkeeper. With both Krul and his deputy Rob Elliot currently injured, Alnwick has been hurled in at the deep end and must contend with Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and company at Old Trafford.</p>'
