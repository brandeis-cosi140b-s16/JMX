b'Football transfer rumours: Liverpool to sign Ipswich\xe2\x80\x99s Teddy Bishop?'


b'<p>Sound the Wonder Kid klaxon! In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s a double klaxon day! Sound the Player Who Sounds Like He\xe2\x80\x99s Actually A Soft Toy Designed to Teach Children About Religion klaxon too!</p> <p>Yes, the big boys are circling around Ipswich\xe2\x80\x99s 18-year-old tyro and cuddly ecumenical learning aid Teddy Bishop and it is Liverpool who are apparently in \xe2\x80\x9cpole position\xe2\x80\x9d, presumably having come through some sort of qualifying session faster than anyone else. The midfielder won\xe2\x80\x99t be going anywhere this January, but could well be heading out of Portman Road in the summer.</p> <p>Dnipro\xe2\x80\x99s Yevhen Konoplyanka was very much Mr Transfer Window 2014 but it\xe2\x80\x99s halfway through January and he\xe2\x80\x99s still kicking his heels at Dnipro. His contract in Ukraine runs out in the summer, though, so Tottenham fancy bagging the tricky winger for a cut-price \xc2\xa37m this month. And Dnipro don\xe2\x80\x99t really like the idea of him leaving for nowt in a few months so could at last be amenable. The problem for Spurs? Manchester United and Internazionale are also in the hunt.</p> <p>Heading out of White Hart Lane, meanwhile, are Paulinho and \xc3\x89tienne Capoue. Juventus want the former, while struggling Parma are keen on the latter.</p> <p>Wigan Athletic\xe2\x80\x99s Callum McManaman is just the fellow to pull West Brom out of the relegation mire, reckons Tony Pulis. He\xe2\x80\x99ll have to stump up more than the \xc2\xa34m Albion have offered so far. The Latics want \xc2\xa36m and not a penny less.</p> <p>Garry Monk is going to act fast after watching his Swansea side ship five against Chelsea at the weekend \xe2\x80\x93 Norwich\xe2\x80\x99s Martin Olsson is the answer to their defensive woes. And a Swans bid of \xc2\xa34m might be enough to tempt the Canaries to talk turkey.</p> <p>Swedish defenders are this week, like footsie socks, T-bar necklace pendants, traffic cones and mutton chops, very much In. West Ham reckon Marcus Nilsson is very me, very now, and the international is available on a free after his release from Kalmar.</p> <p>Hang on. Mutton chops?</p> <p>Alan Pardew is struggling to contain his striker habit at Selhurst Park. Not content with bringing in Yaya Sanogo from Arsenal, he now wants Blackburn\xe2\x80\x99s Rudy Gestede and his old Newcastle charge Papiss Ciss\xc3\xa9. Blackburn want \xc2\xa36m for their man; the chances of Ciss\xc3\xa9 leaving St James\xe2\x80\x99 for a rival are pretty slim you would think.</p> <p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s Big Defender Search \xe2\x80\x93 coming soon to a multiplex near you \xe2\x80\x93 shows no sign of slowing. Villarreal\xe2\x80\x99s Gabriel Paulista and Valencia\xe2\x80\x99s Nicol\xc3\xa1s Otamendi are the latest names on the Arsenal manager\xe2\x80\x99s list.</p> <p>And Paul Lambert isn\xe2\x80\x99t content with simply boring Villa fans to tears. He wants to really upset them by sending one of the few bright spots of a miserable season, Jack Grealish, out on loan to the Championship. Wolves, Brentford and Nottingham Forest will all be happy to riff on the Villa fans\xe2\x80\x99 pain.</p>'
