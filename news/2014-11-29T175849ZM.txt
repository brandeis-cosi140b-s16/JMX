b'<p>On a day when times past were remembered at the Riverside \xe2\x80\x93 the former manager John Neal, who died this month, and the guest of honour Juninho \xe2\x80\x93 a young Middlesbrough side suggested the good times might be around the corner again for the Teessiders.</p> <p>Full of purpose and precision they outclassed a Rovers team which, like them, has been making impressive progress towards the top of the Championship. And it was cruel that just when Boro looked as if they had sealed all three points they suffered a sting in the tail with a controversial 95th minute equaliser.</p> <p>The on-loan Chelsea attacker Patrick Bamford, who had duelled with Rovers\xe2\x80\x99 keeper Simon Eastwood all afternoon, looked to have settled matters when he finally found the back of the net with a deflected shot in the 83rd minute.</p> <p>But Rovers\xe2\x80\x99 leading goalscorer Rudy Gestede bundled home in stoppage time \xe2\x80\x93 a goal the Boro manager, Aitkor Karanka, was convinced should not have stood. The referee, Mark Clattenburg, saw nothing amiss as the flattened home keeper, Dimi Konstantopolous, received treatment and his fuming manager was sent to the stands.</p> <p>But that Rovers were still in a position to level at that stage was purely down to the excellence of their man-of-the-match keeper Simon Eastwood.</p> <p>Eastwood was only making his first league start of the season because the first-choice Jason Steele was ineligible to play against his parent club. And the 25-year-old stand-in was flawless.</p> <p>After a first half in which he denied Grant Leadbitter and the on-loan 19-year-old Bamford three times, he produced as good a save as you will ever see in the second.</p> <p>The full-back George Friend\xe2\x80\x99s cross from the left looked a goal all the way when the unmarked striker Jelle Vossen powered a header goalwards from six yards out on the hour. Somehow Eastwood got a reflex block in with the Boro fans already half-celebrating.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSave of the Season,\xe2\x80\x9d was the verdict of the beaming Rovers manager, Gary Bowyer. It was a block worth the admission money in itself.</p> <p>But 10 minutes later Eastwood produced a save nearly as good to thwart Emilio Nsue\xe2\x80\x99s vicious first-time volley from 20 yards. And 10 minutes from time he stopped Lee Tomlin\xe2\x80\x99s first-time volley, before Bamford finally made the breakthrough with that diverted effort.</p> <p>It was a vital contribution from the keeper, especially given the never-say-die spirit of his team-mates, which Bowyer hailed afterwards.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe were backs to the wall at times but you accept that can happen when you\xe2\x80\x99re up against good sides,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all Boro \xe2\x80\x93 we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t forget we hit the post late on too \xe2\x80\x93 but yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s great that we have that character and determination in the side under pressure.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Karanka apologised for his own display afterwards, while praising that of his team. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very frustrating,\xe2\x80\x9d he sighed. \xe2\x80\x9cWe did everything well.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe problem was their goal and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the goal should have stood \xe2\x80\x93 our keeper was fouled. It was tough to take because we had worked so hard for 93 minutes and what we had worked so hard for was almost in our grasp.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was sent to the stands for pushing the fourth official but I was arguing with him, not touching him. Even so, I would like to apologise because my behaviour was not good and Middlesbrough Football Club deserves better from me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Middlesbrough players looked afterwards as if they had lost rather than drawn. But if this youthful Boro side is as resilient as it looks, it will only learn from disappointments like this.</p>'
