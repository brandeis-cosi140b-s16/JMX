b'Joe Hart struggles to see positives in being dropped by Manchester City'


b'<p>Joe Hart has signalled his discontent at not playing every match at Manchester City, saying it is \xe2\x80\x9chard to see any positives\xe2\x80\x9d after Manuel Pellegrini left him out of the two most recent matches. The Chilean manager also said, on the eve of the club\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League game against Roma, that a new deal for the goalkeeper is not a pressing priority.</p> <p>While Pellegrini has said Hart will be reinstated for Tuesday evening\xe2\x80\x99s game, the manager preferred Willy Caballero for City\xe2\x80\x99s 7-0 hiding of Sheffield Wednesday in the Capital One Cup and Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s 4-2 win at Hull City. Hart, asked about being stood down when sitting alongside his manager on Monday, said: \xe2\x80\x9cOf course I want to play every game. That\xe2\x80\x99s my nature, my professionalism. I always want to play but I\xe2\x80\x99m not the manager, I\xe2\x80\x99m just a player. I live by the decisions of our manager. I think he knows that I\xe2\x80\x99d love to play but he has to make decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The 27-year-old had enjoyed a run of 123 consecutive league appearances over four years before Pellegrini dropped him last autumn for two months. With Caballero, Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s No1 when in charge at M\xc3\xa1laga, providing serious competition, Hart does not find any positives in being left out.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard for me to see it that way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure that when I retire from football in many years to come I\xe2\x80\x99ll see them but right now I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to see positives.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini countered by saying that leaving out Hart had not been a difficult decision. The Chilean said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a very easy decision because we have to play around 60 games in the whole year and Joe has played eight games in 32 days, which is a lot of games for a goalkeeper or any player. For Willy it was good to play two games in a row. There is no problem. Joe is a very good professional and every player wants to play. Any player who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to play is no good for Manchester City but he understands without a problem.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Hart did concede that having a rival vying for the jersey can bring out the best in him. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have always had good goalkeepers \xe2\x80\x93 David James, [Andreas] Isaksson, Kasper [Schmeichel], [Costel] Pantilimon. It has always been a fight for me to keep my place and that will continue but I have always had high standards that I will keep to, whether there is one goalkeeper or 20. I love the challenge,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>Despite Vincent Kompany, Samir Nasri, Edin Dzeko, David Silva, Aleksandar Kolarov and Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero recently signing fresh terms, Hart, who is inside the final two years of his deal, is yet to do so. Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cMe and Joe know what\xe2\x80\x99s happening with that issue. I think it\xe2\x80\x99s important we know how to manage it but it\xe2\x80\x99s not the most important thing at this moment. We are thinking about Roma and how to continue winning and getting points in the Premier League.\xe2\x80\x9d Pressed on this, Hart said: \xe2\x80\x9cThe same.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>After losing 1-0 at Bayern Munich 1-0 in the opening Group E tie, City will want to beat Roma if they are to achieve their stated aim of finishing top. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is obviously a big game after a disappointing start in Munich,\xe2\x80\x9d Hart said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are aware it is the league and not knockout phase but especially at home we are going in trying to win the game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini is insistent that, despite the win at Hull being the first league victory this month, the side is performing how it should. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we are playing well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe in the beginning of the season we didn\xe2\x80\x99t score so many goals here at home, especially against Chelsea and Stoke. We scored only one goal in those two games but after that the team returned to their normal performance. In this moment I trust a lot in the team because I think we are in a good moment.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>With Ag\xc3\xbcero having scored four in seven appearances, Pellegrini also believes the Argentineian can challenge Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the title of the world\xe2\x80\x99s finest footballer.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAg\xc3\xbcero is among the best players in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Champions magazine. \xe2\x80\x9cNow it is up to him to make it and fight for the Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or as best player because he has all the qualities you can ask of a football player. He is technically very strong, he is fast and has a lot of power. He is very intelligent, able to play in his position in between midfield and attack.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe hope we will see Sergio back in the form he demonstrated in the Premier League [last season] before his injuries hit him. I believe he will make a difference this season.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
