b'The Fiver | Liverpool are in a right old pickle'


b'THE TIME IS NIGH <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s the end of the Big Cup groups this week, and Liverpool head into their final match knowing that only a win over Basel/Basle/Baaaarrrl will suffice. Quite understandably, this desperate state of affairs has revived memories of a decade ago, when a misfiring Liverpool side went into their final group game against Olympiakos knowing that only a two-goal victory would see them through to the knockout stages, then promptly shipped another to leave themselves with quite the poser. But a hero stepped up to the plate that evening. All hail Neil Mellor, who came on with 11 minutes to go and Liverpool still two goals shy of their target. Mellor scored one before setting up another, and Liverpool were, with a 3-1 win secured against all the odds, through! What a legend! Ya beauty!</p> <p>Sadly for today\xe2\x80\x99s Liverpool, Mellor is long gone. As is Florent Sinama Pongolle, who like Mellor also notched a goal and an assist that night, though he took a whopping 45 minutes to make his contribution. For the record, Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s other goal was scored by a Steven Gerrard. He\xe2\x80\x99s no longer with Liverpool either, having been replaced at approximately 2.53pm on 27 April 2014 by this pasty-white apparition that floats around aimlessly, staring 1,000 yards into the distance, never to blink. Some say it\xe2\x80\x99s the same man, but anyone who went to that Chelsea game can see that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case. So Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s gone too, which means Liverpool are in a right old pickle, and this is before they consider how Basel/Basle/Baaaarrrl won home and away against Chelsea last year, put Liverpool out at this stage in 2002, and have never lost against the Reds. Oh $tevie! Why did you leave!</p> <p>In fairness to the apparition, it\xe2\x80\x99s been doing quite well of late, having put in a shift against Leicester City last week, then played quite a nice crossfield pass while coming on as a late sub against Sunderland at the weekend. It\xe2\x80\x99s not quite Steven Gerrard of old, but what can you expect from a shadowy wraith. Whether a mere apparition has the heft to drive Liverpool to victory against a side which has won seven of their last eight games, and conceded just two goals in their last seven, and one of those to Real Madrid, is a moot point. And perhaps explains why Brendan Rodgers is considering naming 17-year-old wing prospect Sheyi Ojo on the bench, with a view to throwing on the pacy youngster should things get desperate. Which, if Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s form since 2.53pm on 27 April 2014 is anything to go by, they almost certainly will.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Scott Murray will be here from 7.45pm GMT for MBM coverage of Liverpool 1-0 Basel/Basle/Baaaarrrl (Ojo 90+5), while Paul Doyle will be on hand to guide you through Galatasaray 1-1 Arsenal.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEverything is $hit because we lost\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Southampton manager Ronald Koeman echoes the thoughts of hundreds of thousands of football fans at 4.50pm every Saturday after his side\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 loss to Manchester United, a result that prompted Gary Neville to get Louis van Gaal in a funk by saying this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s United v Liverpool game will resemble a pub match. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has to pay attention to his words,\xe2\x80\x9d sniffed Van Gaal, who knows a thing or two about these things.</p> OUR NEW LOOK (AKA, SELF-FLAGELLATION DEPT) <p>Big Website\xe2\x80\x99s football and sport pages have a new look. Check them out for yourself, read about the design changes, and then queue up, flaming pitchforks in hand, to complain here.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs a fan of Woody Allen\xe2\x80\x99s earlier, funny films, I developed an emotional connection to his work and feel committed to seeing each new film he produces. Unfortunately there has been a significant drop in quality over the years, despite the occasional recent bright spot, and so I\xe2\x80\x99m often left disappointed and not having got value for the price of my cinema ticket, yet still I cannot just abandon my commitment to his oeuvre. Nonetheless, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think this commitment, and the fact that I\xe2\x80\x99m paying good money only to be left disappointed by his work, gives me the right to go along to the set of his current film and start heckling him while he\xe2\x80\x99s trying to direct. Indeed, I can\xe2\x80\x99t see how this might help someone perform an analytical, complicated job where he needs to be able to concentrate in order to even have chance of doing it well. And, if I did take it on myself to try to provide some such motivation, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really object if Woody returned my heckling in kind (and his would probably be a lot funnier than mine), or even get the set security to have me removed. I assumed football management would be analogous, but perhaps certain Leicester City fans can set me right about that?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 David Wall.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn response to Paul Cantwell\xe2\x80\x99s proposals about changing the sections of the Fiver (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters), might I suggest that you establish a new section entitled \xe2\x80\x98Latest update on Jack Wilshere\xe2\x80\x99s health/social activities\xe2\x80\x99?
