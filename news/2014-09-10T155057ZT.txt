b'The Fiver | A rather baffling queue of masochists and self-sacrificers'


b'NEVER FORGET <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m always on the lookout for a future ex-Mrs Malcolm\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 mathematician and chaotician Dr Ian Malcolm.</p> <p>Carlo Mazzone, Luigi Radice, Bruno Giorgi, Oscar Tabarez, Giovanni Trapattoni, Bruno Giorgi, Gregorio Perez, Carlo Mazzone, Giampiero Ventura, Oscar Tabarez, Renzo Ulivieri, Gianfranco Bellotto, Giuseppe Materazzi, Antonio Sala, Giulio Nuciari, Nedo Sonetti, Giampiero Ventura, Edoardo Reja, Daniele Arrigoni, Attilio Tesser, Daniele Arrigoni, Davide Ballardini, Nedo Sonetti, Davide Ballardini, Massimiliano Allegri, Giorgio Melis, Pierpaolo Bisoli, Roberto Donadoni, Massimo Ficcadenti, Davide Ballardini, Massimo Ficcadenti, Ivo Pulga, Diego Lopez, Brian McDermott, Dave Hockaday.</p> <p>Usually when you see names listed like that they\xe2\x80\x99re on a memorial wall somewhere, remembered as the fallen victims of some spurious war or other. And perhaps in Cagliari there is such a wall, detailing the managers who fell during Massimo Cellino\xe2\x80\x99s 22 years at the club. They are, like so many struck down in conflict, a mere statistic now, one of many dismissed on a whim and a flick of a Cellino finger, just another soldier sent running over the top with no realistic hope of surviving for very long.</p> <p>You\xe2\x80\x99ll notice a few recurring names in that list, which tells us that, despite the inevitability of their rather rapid dismissal, some men go back for more, perhaps convinced that they can do a better job the next time, or that Cellino has changed, or that they can change him, despite two decades of evidence to the contrary. Likewise, with the Leeds job open for applications, there seems to be a rather baffling queue of masochists and self-sacrificers who appear willing to join the list of those who will one day be called into Massimo\xe2\x80\x99s office, told not to bother sitting down, and fired out of the window in a cannon, sailing gently through the cool West Yorkshire air.</p> <p>Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink is the latest man to declare his interest, the former Leeds striker, noted Dutchman, confirmed brick sh*thouse and professionally affable man throwing his hat into a rather spicy ring on Wednesday. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they want to talk to me, of course I would be interested,\xe2\x80\x9d Jimmy ah yesched. \xe2\x80\x9cWho doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to manage Leeds United? It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the 10 biggest jobs in the country.\xe2\x80\x9d The cruel might suggest that if actually wanting to work for Cellino didn\xe2\x80\x99t qualify Hasselbaink for \xe2\x80\x98troubled\xe2\x80\x99 status, then believing the Leeds job to be one of England\xe2\x80\x99s 10 biggest certainly would, but the Fiver is obviously not that way inclined.</p> <p>Hasselbaink joins a list of the keen and gluttons for punishment which is also said to feature Robbie Fowler, Neil Redfearn, Tony Mowbray, Giuseppe Sannino, Paolo di Canio, Roberto di Matteo, Chris Hughton and so on and so forth. Think of these men as extreme sports enthusiasts, who aren\xe2\x80\x99t bothered about BASE jumping or free climbing, but who rather seemingly cannot live without the thrill of imminent dismissal, who get their kicks from being on the brink of the dole, who are given tingles at the very sight of a P45. Perhaps they\xe2\x80\x99re all gonzo journalists, determined to place themselves in peril to fully immerse themselves in the story, and will produce a heady tome in around a year, detailing their brief but exhilarating time working for the man who casually swats away managers like a lion brushes aside flies with his tail. Perhaps they just think it would be nice to get out of the house for a bit.</p> <p>The thing is, it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty difficult to argue with the results. In 22 years under Cellino, Cagliari were never relegated from Serie A, having spent large parts of the previous decade in various states of lower division heck (although admittedly they were actually in the top flight when Cellino arrived), so perhaps he does know what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing. Perhaps the English condition of patience has been holding these clubs back for years, and the real way to go is to bin the boss at the first sign of trouble. It is not a pleasant way to deal with people, but perhaps Cellino knows what\xe2\x80\x99s best for his team.</p> <p>Of course that might be stuff and nonsense, and it remains baffling why so many are determined to line up to be knocked down. Under Cellino, there\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing as a Leeds manager, just a man he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t sacked yet. For some reason, plenty of people seem keen to join the ranks.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe had a Buddy Holly Tribute act who can only be described as brilliant.

The same old mistakes over and over again. Honestly. It\xe2\x80\x99s just like watching England!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Justin Kavanagh and 1,056 others.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m guessing there will be more than me and the other 1,056 Fiver pedants reporting your Groundhog Day glitch yesterday.

I\xe2\x80\x99ve completely changed my view on the man: at the time I felt he was a money grabbing fool (cleanest word I could think of) who was out of touch with the real world. Now, I can\xe2\x80\x99t help but feel he was a visionary who could clearly see the future. There must have been a few other readers who shared my thought on re-reading this quote in 2014: \xc2\xa355k a week for an established international full back, what were Arsenal thinking?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Brendan Mackinney.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI too am grateful to Tom Hoffman (Monday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver) for putting us right on certain aspects of Mexican cooking. When I presented my culinary attempt to a Mexican man he was so incensed he threw his wife off a cliff. When I asked him why, he replied \xe2\x80\x98Tequila!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Marten Allen.</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
