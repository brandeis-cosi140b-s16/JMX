b'Manchester United manager convinced of Wayne Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s desire to win FA'


b'<p>Louis van Gaal believes Wayne Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s desire to win the FA Cup can drive Manchester United to the trophy for the first time since 2004. United entertain Arsenal this evening for a place in the semi-finals.</p> <p>Rooney has yet to taste FA Cup success \xe2\x80\x93 he signed for United in the summer of 2004 following the club\xe2\x80\x99s last triumph, a 3-0 victory over Millwall. Tonight\xe2\x80\x99s sixth-round tie is a repeat of the 2005 final, which Arsenal won on penalties.</p> <p>Rooney is the sole survivor from the game who will feature at Old Trafford and, asked how determined the forward is to win, Van Gaal said: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is very motivated as a captain and a player and he wants to win a title and he has not won the FA Cup.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Rooney has won five Premier Leagues, two League Cups and a European Cup. Yet despite this list of successes Van Gaal is sure that he is desperate to add the FA Cup to his collection of major honours.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat is something that is missing. My first championship with Ajax was very important for me, it was also an emotional thing,\xe2\x80\x9d the manager said of winning the 1993-94 Eredivisie, before pointing to how Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s hunger led to Ashley Young\xe2\x80\x99s late winner at Newcastle United in the club\xe2\x80\x99s previous match. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have seen how he was motivated in the last minute of the game. You saw him running and pressing for a lost ball and that was fantastic. Every human being has his own identity and character and this is Wayne\xe2\x80\x99s character and he has also picked up red cards because of that character, but against Newcastle it was fantastic.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As this is Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s first campaign with United he is clear on how vital winning a trophy can be for the side\xe2\x80\x99s development. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can say you play for your profession but that is not enough, you want to win something,\xe2\x80\x9d the 63-year-old said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe players want to win something and also the manager and also the fans. When you win a title like the FA Cup, which in England is very important, when you fight for something and you get it, you are pleased and that is why Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho is saying that [about Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s League Cup win].</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you compare coaches with one another, titles are very important. When a player wins they have already the experience of winning a final \xe2\x80\x93 there are a lot of positive things.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Gaal has been heartened by United\xe2\x80\x99s never-say-die spirit. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have showed a lot of times that we have been coming back in the last minute, even when we are behind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe scored out of nothing [against Newcastle] because the ball was already lost but because of Wayne\xe2\x80\x99s spirit he made it very difficult for his opponent. We have shown a fantastic fight and I am very proud of our players.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
