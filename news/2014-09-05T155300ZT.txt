b'The Fiver: Mr Roy\xe2\x80\x99s lid begins to rattle | Scott Murray'


b'PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS <p>Poor old Mr Roy. He\xe2\x80\x99s worked hard to get where he is today. Using \xe2\x80\x9cmethods which have translated from Halmstads to Malmo to Orebro to Neuchatel Xamax to the Swiss national team\xe2\x80\x9d, he\xe2\x80\x99s managed 20 sides in a 38-year coaching career, and won major titles with three of them. In the Nordic countries. That\xe2\x80\x99s a decent 15% return! Not only that, he took Fulham to a Euro Vase final, a stellar achievement sort of like Steve McClaren\xe2\x80\x99s at Middlesbrough only without having already led the club to their first-ever cup. And he gave it a brave go against formidable Northampton Town when boss of little Liverpool. Good old Mr Roy! Now he\xe2\x80\x99s finally got the job he deserves, the England gig, and in two years he\xe2\x80\x99s CLANG won two competitive games in CLANG seven matches at CLANG two finals while CLANG the side are CLANG no better than they were under Fabio CLANG Capello CLANG pranged the company car CLANG flooded the executive washroom CLANG CLANG CLANG a tail of toilet paper sticking out the back of his trousers CLANG CLANG CLANG CLANG CLANG CLANK PING CLANG.</p> <p>Whatever is that sound? It sounds awfully like pennies dropping, though knowing the media as we do, that surely can\xe2\x80\x99t be the case. Mind you, the supportive band of journalists who have backed Mr Roy since day one are beginning to ask the odd awkward question, in the wake of England\xe2\x80\x99s win-that-felt-like-a-defeat against Norway. As a consequence, Mr Roy\xe2\x80\x99s lid is beginning to rattle like the top of a box packed with fertiliser, coins and Semtex. When it was pointed out that England had only two attempts on goal on Wednesday night, Mr Roy resorted to the sort of industrial language usually only heard in licensed public bars after 10pm, and never in a family email such as the Fiver. There was no need for it, not least because England really did have only two attempts on goal on Wednesday night, and no amount of comparing the statistic to a big pair of sweaty, hairy balls is ever going to change the fact.</p> <p>Goodness knows what he\xe2\x80\x99d have been like had England lost. But we might find that out on Monday night, as England\xe2\x80\x99s chances of a good result in their first Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland have receded a little. Daniel Sturridge has thigh-gah and Gary Cahill has missed training with ankle-knack, after being substituted against Norway, and though FA apparatchiks insist he\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine for the big game, you never can tell with these things. And in other news which in no way suggests everyone surrounding the camp is getting jittery, England\xe2\x80\x99s players will have access to the renowned sports psychiatrist Steve Peters, who worked with Liverpool last season, presumably ahead of those matches against Chelsea and Crystal Palace. At least that\xe2\x80\x99s the plan. Whether Peters will have time left for any of them once he\xe2\x80\x99s finished applying cold towels to the fevered brow of Mr Roy, curled up on the chaise longue, jabbering, is far from certain.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAt West Ham I was shunted around all the different positions. I remember one time I had to play as a striker. That was not good for my career. I wanted to play for a club that is high in the Premier League table\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 new Hull signing Mohamed Diam\xc3\xa9 waits all of three days before taking aim at Big Sam for knacking his mojo with his fluid approach to tactics.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel.

I would suggest Liberty Cap, so at least the fans can see some movement\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Justin Johnson.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAm I the only one who thinks the Fiver is getting more amorous? Following on from the ill-fated Soulmates advert, it seems that a little kiss (in the form of an \xe2\x80\x98x\xe2\x80\x99) is found at the bottom of the \xe2\x80\x985pm\xe2\x80\x99 missive \xe2\x80\x93 under the Guardian Today UK edition. It\xe2\x80\x99s such a friendly moment. Thanks!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Michael Holt.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was very pleased to notice that in Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver in a Bit and/or Bob you mentioned that Monaco had failed to replace Falcao and James/Hames/Jamez Rodriguez with \xe2\x80\x9cany other suitable gallictacos\xe2\x80\x9d. My face lit up. I began to compose a Fiver Letter pointing this out with all the wit and snark I could muster. Then I stopped. I felt inadequate amongst such an experienced field of pedantry. I thought I should let it be, that many others would inundate the Fiver with wittier and snarkier replies than I could manage. I open up Friday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver and \xe2\x80\xa6 nothing. I\xe2\x80\x99ve only just now considered that this spelling may have been intentional. Regardless, my mind is full of images of Asterix, covered in refried beans, in a taco, in a Monaco kit, playing football in front of no one\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ben Harries.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: writing the best Fiver ever (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver).
