b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho made an extraordinary appearance on television on Sunday morning in which he accused Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s Ashley Barnes of a \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal\xe2\x80\x9d tackle on Nemanja Matic and turned his fire on refereeing standards and media coverage.</p> <p>Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s manager had little to say on Saturday after the 1-1 draw to Burnley, simply listing key moments in the match, but appearing at his own request on Sky Sports\xe2\x80\x99 Goals on Sunday programme he railed for 27 minutes against perceived injustices and claimed:</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Barnes had perpetrated a \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal\xe2\x80\x9d tackle on Matic;</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Burnley should have been down to 10 men and Chelsea should have received two penalties by half-time;</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Diego Costa in particular is being unfairly targeted by the media;</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Video technology should be introduced to help referees.</p> <p>Matic was sent off on Saturday for retaliating to a dangerous challenge by Barnes and Mourinho was outraged that the Burnley player went unpunished. He claimed that Matic\xe2\x80\x99s reaction was understandable because the tackle by Barnes could have ended the Serb\xe2\x80\x99s career, and on Sunday evening Chelsea said they would be appealing against the red card.</p> <p>He expanded on the theme to castigate Sky Sports again for its coverage of Diego Costa\xe2\x80\x99s stamp on Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Emre Can last month, for which the Chelsea strikerreceived a retrospective three-game ban. The channel repeatedly showed that incident under the strapline \xe2\x80\x9cCosta\xe2\x80\x99s crimes\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I finished at the game against Liverpool I went to the dressing room and the first thing I saw on the big screen, reading non-stop \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x98Diego Costa crimes\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI would like to know how you, Sky Sports, describe the actions of the Burnley player yesterday? My English is not good enough to find a word. When you think \xe2\x80\x98Diego crimes\xe2\x80\x99 after he puts his boot on a hand, when this is \xe2\x80\x98Diego crimes\xe2\x80\x99, the minimum you have to say is \xe2\x80\x98criminal tackle\xe2\x80\x99. Did you apologise to Chelsea, to Diego or myself? You didn\xe2\x80\x99t.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs an institution, Sky is so important in the Premier League, you never apologise. When Diego Costa has a three-match ban, probably three matches to Matic ... tell me how many matches this player deserves?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho was fined \xc2\xa325,000 by the FA in January for suggesting there was a \xe2\x80\x9ccampaign\xe2\x80\x9d in the media against Chelsea but he maintained his attack on Sunday. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like the fact you start immediately, in that moment, the public judgment of the player,\xe2\x80\x9d he added of the Costa coverage.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou gave no space to the people that have to decide, the pressure was so much. You don\xe2\x80\x99t do this with every club, with every player. Last year, Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 against Norwich, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the same approach; [Robin] van Persie against West Ham, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the same approach. This one [on Saturday] was even worse. This can be end of career. Matic is a very lucky guy.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t find the word to describe what that player [Barnes] did. I can clearly understand that football is about emotions and sometimes you lose emotions. Clearly Matic had a reason to lose his emotions. What could be the consequence of his push for the other player? Nothing. The consequence for Matic could be end of career.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho also repeated his belief that Chelsea should have had two penalties against Burnley and Barnes should have been sent off for a challenge on Branislav Ivanovic even before the one on Matic. Although he said those incidents were not open to interpretation, Mourinho said he did not doubt the integrity of the referee, Martin Atkinson.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine that the four incidents of this game are open to interpretation,\xe2\x80\x9d he claimed. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is what it is. I think if you say it in a way where you go over the line with your comments, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s understandable, but if you just say what is obvious, without attacking the integrity of the people, if you\xe2\x80\x99re just honest and objective in your comments then it shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a problem.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe best players in the world can make mistakes. They miss penalties. The best goalkeepers make mistakes. This gentleman is one of the top referees in European football. He can also make mistakes. He made important mistakes yesterday. I know to be a referee is so difficult. Sometimes I referee in the training session and I ask for assistance. But there are situations that are not open to interpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho said video technology would banish the murkiness around contentious decisions. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the referee can\xe2\x80\x99t see a penalty three metres in front of him, an official in front of a screen can\xe2\x80\x99t miss it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we want to protect the integrity of the referee and believe that the mistake is the consequence of misinterpretation or a bad position, I think technology can help.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mourinho also addressed Frank Lampard\xe2\x80\x99s departure from Chelsea, saying that the club wanted him to stay and thought he was leaving them to move to the USA.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe let him go for different reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all, I think the motivation Frank has to have this role at City wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the same motivation he has to have the same role at Chelsea. Secondly, we open the door for him to choose his future and we thought he\xe2\x80\x99d go to the States and would come back after a couple of years to do what he wants. We would have found a new department for him! What he did for Chelsea for more than one decade was something amazing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
