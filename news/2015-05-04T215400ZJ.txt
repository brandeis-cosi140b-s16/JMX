b'John Terry feared he might not win Premier League title again'


b'<p>John Terry has admitted there were times when he feared he had celebrated his last Premier League title before Chelsea claimed a first championship in five years on Sunday, with the captain now confident this team can generate another trophy-laden era at the club.</p> <p>The former England captain will hoist the trophy for the fourth time after the club\xe2\x80\x99s final league game of the season, with their 1-0 victory over Crystal Palace securing Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side their title. Terry has been an ever-present, his contribution outstanding in a team who have lost only twice in the league all season, with the 34-year-old having recently signed a new one-year deal to extend his stay into an 18th campaign.</p>  <p> Related: Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas: Chelsea title may herald new Mourinho era of success </p>   <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been five years since the last title, too long,\xe2\x80\x9d said Terry. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing other teams win it when you\xe2\x80\x99re pushing them right to the end, like we did last year \xe2\x80\xa6 well, at times I did wonder whether that one in 2010 would be my last one. It\xe2\x80\x99s felt like a long time watching other teams do it. Manchester City came in and dominated for a couple of years, as well, and that\xe2\x80\x99s hard to take when you\xe2\x80\x99ve won it before and don\xe2\x80\x99t for a while.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s special, particularly when it\xe2\x80\x99s the first one you\xe2\x80\x99ve won together. For Cesc [F\xc3\xa0bregas] it\xe2\x80\x99s the first one. For Gary Cahill, too. You can feel that hunger, like when we won our first one [in 2005]. We all said then: \xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s do it again.\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be even tougher next year because four or five sides around us will maybe buy some big players in the summer and put real challenges in. So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be back stronger and hungrier next year.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut this current squad can go on and achieve a lot. It\xe2\x80\x99s a new group, so let\xe2\x80\x99s keep building on what we\xe2\x80\x99ve achieved so far. Collectively, we learned a lot last season, but we made big signings last summer. Diego Costa\xe2\x80\x99s scored a lot of goals, Cesc made a lot of assists. This group of players can go on to win a lot of things for the club.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Terry suggested Mourinho had been key to this year\xe2\x80\x99s title race, the Portuguese adapting the team\xe2\x80\x99s style shrewdly when injuries and suspensions threatened progress over the second half of the season. Chelsea have trailed in the league for only 171 minutes all season and will have been top of the table for 274 days by the end of the current campaign, with the centre-half praising the manager\xe2\x80\x99s meticulous preparation and offering a defence of the champions\xe2\x80\x99 style. </p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe way we started the season was really exciting,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter the West Bromwich Albion game [in November], Cesc came away saying it was the best football he\xe2\x80\x99s played and for him to say that, having been at Bar\xc3\xa7a and in some of the biggest teams in the world, made everyone listen. We did play some really exciting football but teams learn. They don\xe2\x80\x99t come to Stamford Bridge and open up. They sit back and make it difficult. It\xe2\x80\x99s down to the manager to find a way, and he always finds a way.</p>  <p> Related: Chelsea are Premier League champions again \xe2\x80\x93 who can stop them next season? </p>   <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe spend two days before every game working at ways to break teams down and get behind teams. For the big games, he\xe2\x80\x99s got ideas and he\xe2\x80\x99s got methods, and we spend just the right amount of time on it. If you look at the big games in the last two years, we\xe2\x80\x99ve not lost one. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had all that \xe2\x80\x98boring Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99 stuff, but the manager\xe2\x80\x99s been the difference. He goes into so much detail and gives you the best opportunity as a player. If it then doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go well, it\xe2\x80\x99s the players\xe2\x80\x99 responsibility because he\xe2\x80\x99s done everything he can in terms of tactics or team talks. He leaves no stone unturned.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Terry was critical of Rafael Ben\xc3\xadtez after the match on Sunday, making it clear he had proved the former Chelsea interim manager wrong after the Spaniard had suggested, in 2013, that the defender was not fit enough to play twice in a week. He has featured in every league minute of this season to date and will expect to play a significant role again next term, even if he remains realistic about his long-term future at the club.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere will come a point when enough\xe2\x80\x99s enough, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll know when that is and I\xe2\x80\x99ll be the first to say: \xe2\x80\x98Listen, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do this no more,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Terry. \xe2\x80\x9cThe last thing I want to do is go out there and get embarrassed every week. It will be for me to say and I\xe2\x80\x99ll make sure I\xe2\x80\x99m ahead of everyone else. I know there will be a point when that\xe2\x80\x99s it. The players are getting quicker and stronger. The ability out there is phenomenal.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
