b'A NORTHERN SOUL <p>Anyone who remembers the glory days of the northern soul scene in the 1970s will know that Wigan has long been a hotbed of multiculturalism. The Fiver has failed to find out if local replica-shirt price-fixing magnate Dave Whelan ever went down the Casino in Oxford bags and brogues, clutching a tub of talcum powder, a dip in his hip and a glide in his stride, with the express intention of performing a few spins, backflips and smooth shuffles to a few rare R&amp;B platters. But we\xe2\x80\x99re guessing not. He did break his leg in the 1960 FA Cup final, after all, and those high kicks don\xe2\x80\x99t perform themselves. Perhaps he put his feet up and stayed at home instead, watching whatever was on television back then, stuff like the Black and White Minstrel Show, or Mind Your Language, or the Black and White Minstrel Show. But like we say, the Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s failed to find out any of that.</p> <p>What we do know is that the Wigan Athletic chairman has made a bit of a PR pig\xe2\x80\x99s lug of dealing with his controversial appointment of new manager Malky Mackay, currently under FA investigation for sending a series of text messages that make him out to be a bit of an unreconstructed berk. Whelan defended Mackay as \xe2\x80\x9can honourable man\xe2\x80\x9d, and fair\xe2\x80\x99s fair, everyone deserves a second chance to prove their innate human decency. But Whelan really didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anybody, least of all himself, any favours when last night he embarked on a leftfield riff in which he managed to offend the Irish, Jewish people and everyone from China. That\xe2\x80\x99s the best part of two billion people in one fell swoop, not bad going at all, a diplomatic achievement that knocks the efforts of erstwhile BBC1 prime-time act George Mitchell and his heavily made-up Minstrels into one of their straw boaters.</p> <p>To be fair to Whelan, he did subsequently apologise for accusing Jewish people of being obsessed with money and for saying there was nothing wrong with calling Chinese people \xe2\x80\x9cchinks\xe2\x80\x9d. Sort of. \xe2\x80\x9cI did not say that Jewish people chase money more than anybody else. I said that Jewish people do chase money, just like we the English chase money, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s anything wrong in chasing money because we work for it.\xe2\x80\x9d Meanwhile \xe2\x80\x9cif somebody says to a Chinaman \xe2\x80\x98you\xe2\x80\x99re a chink\xe2\x80\x99, would he be upset about it? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know really. If he was, I would say \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m very sorry, I won\xe2\x80\x99t call you that again\xe2\x80\x99. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that there is an insult meant.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Sadly for Whelan, whether or not these comments constitute insults isn\xe2\x80\x99t really up to him. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot insult a whole group of people and then say, \xe2\x80\x98I would never insult them\xe2\x80\x99, and hope that\xe2\x80\x99s OK,\xe2\x80\x9d points out Jonathan Arkush, vice-president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to see a proper apology and full recognition of the offence caused.\xe2\x80\x9d Meanwhile a representative for equality and inclusivity organisation Kick It Out added: \xe2\x80\x9cThese comments must not go unchallenged and have to be investigated by the FA.\xe2\x80\x9d As indeed, the governing body has announced this afternoon, they will be. Of course, this is all grist to the mill for those folk who like to loudly complain that you can\xe2\x80\x99t call anyone anything these days without people taking offence. The same sort of folk who, upon calling people things, become all hot-faced and affronted when people call them things for doing it.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY     It\xe2\x80\x99s Vincent Tan!

Just as \xe2\x80\x98not six months\xe2\x80\x99 turns into \xe2\x80\x98six months\xe2\x80\x99, so \xe2\x80\x98do not let them score\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98do not give them loads of space\xe2\x80\x99 etc get misunderstood. Everyone thought it was opposition strikers tying United\xe2\x80\x99s defence in knots, turns out it was LvG failing to tie them with nots\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Robin Hazlehurst.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cOf all the terrible things that Malky has [allegedly] said, the one that makes this pedant\xe2\x80\x99s hackles rise the most is one of the most inappropriate uses of \xe2\x80\x98footballer\xe2\x80\x99s irony\xe2\x80\x99 I think I have ever read: \xe2\x80\x98I was actually at the 2013 FA Cup final with my son so I know first hand about some of the things Wigan have achieved. It is a little bit ironic to find myself back here as manager and I am proud to have the opportunity.\xe2\x80\x99 If managing a team you have previously watched is ironic, then any other managerial appointment in history would also be ironic. \xe2\x80\x98Any other managerial appointment\xe2\x80\x99 is, ironically, exactly what Dave Whelan should have made \xe2\x80\x93 Owen Powell.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDave Whelan may well have copped a lot less flak if he had appointed Dave Mackay [yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s bits and bobs]\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Martin Leaver (and 1,056 others).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs a self-professed Fiver pedant, Mark Lloyd [yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters] should have known that he misused \xe2\x80\x98only\xe2\x80\x99 in his opening sentence. Unless he knew that the other 1,056 pedant only viewed the Fiver in question, instead of actually reading it (which I\xe2\x80\x99m shamefully admitting I did), he should have written \xe2\x80\x98viewed by only 1,056 pedants\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 Nigel Assam (and no other grammar pedants).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger isn\xe2\x80\x99t mad keen on his youngsters playing in the European Under-21 Championship next summer. \xe2\x80\x9cIf Roy Hodgson wants to do well at the European Championship [in 2016], I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s in his interest to overload the players during the summer preceding the European Championship,\xe2\x80\x9d passive-aggressived the Arsenal manager.</p> <p>Lionel Messi may up sticks and leave Spain over his tax problems. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s fed up with Spain and that\xe2\x80\x99s why he wants to leave,\xe2\x80\x9d a source told misleading-named newspaper El Confidencial.</p> <p>And Swiss third division side Grenchen have sacked 11 players following a 10-0 defeat. \xe2\x80\x9cIt sounds brutal, but these players are not good enough for this league. I am the head of sport and there to do something when [the club] is not running smoothly. I am one who talks less and does more,\xe2\x80\x9d honked sporting director Renato Brun, whose job title suggests he probably had a hand in signing many of the sacked players.</p> STILL WANT MORE?
