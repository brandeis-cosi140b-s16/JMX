b'Manchester City v Bayern Munich: five talking points | Jamie Jackson'


b'1) Manuel Pellegrini at the crossroads <p>Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero\xe2\x80\x99s late, late show has given the Manchester City manager a lifeline but whether or not his team qualify for the knockout stage he should still be under serious scrutiny for going into the final group match with only five points and this victory being their sole win.</p> <p>The Chilean professed contentment with a summer strengthening drive that added Eliaquim Mangala, Fernando, Willy Caballero, Frank Lampard and Bacary Sagna, so he cannot use the excuse of poor recruitment cited by Roberto Mancini when his City outfit failed in the term after they became champions.</p> <p>In the final analysis, City contrived to rescue a last-gasp victory after being 1-0 up against Bayern Munich\xe2\x80\x99s 10-men. This is just not good enough. But then neither has Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s management throughout the phase.</p> 2) Bayern Munich more than a class above the English champions  <p>The Germans may have been hampered by having to play nearly 70 minutes with only 10 men following Mehdi Benatia\xe2\x80\x99s red card, yet Pep Guardiola\xe2\x80\x99s men actually improved following his dismissal.</p> <p>Quite how Joe Hart \xe2\x80\x93 the still questionable City No1 \xe2\x80\x93 allowed Xabi Alonso\xe2\x80\x99s pea-roller from a 20-yard free-kick to beat him is a mystery.</p> <p>There may be further argument about the keeper\xe2\x80\x99s positioning for Robert Lewandowski\xe2\x80\x99s header that went beyond him from the range of the penalty spot. In little doubt, though, is the sheer class of Bayern and how far below is the strata City continue to occupy in comparison to the continent\xe2\x80\x99s finest sides.</p> 3) The Etihad still slumbers <p>Boos met the Uefa anthem because of a crowd ban at CSKA Moscow that cost City fans the opportunity to attend, but noise levels thereafter continued to be patchy.</p> <p>The 37,509 who witnessed City\xe2\x80\x99s 1-1 draw with Roma illustrated the priorities of supporters and set alarm bells ringing at the club. To have north of 9,000 seats empty hardly fits with the hierarchy\xe2\x80\x99s ambition of to add European domination to domestic ascendancy.</p> <p>Thus the two-for-one offer for CSKA Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s visit earlier this month that ensured a sell-out.</p> <p>Beforehand Pellegrini pleaded with the congregation: \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure you will raise the roof \xe2\x80\x93 so we will see what happens.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>What occurred was the mere deepening of the sense that European nights here are yet to properly catch fire.</p> 4) Bacary Sagna gets the nod instead of Pablo Zabaleta <p>The selection of the French right-back for Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s regular first-choice jarred especially after a glance at Sagna\xe2\x80\x99s record since joining: seven appearances and being on the winning side only twice. Yet a clue to the manager\xe2\x80\x99s thinking could be found in the opening group match when Pellegrini also preferred Sagna for Zabaleta. Going further back, to last season, Micah Richards was afforded rare starts when Bayern were again the opposition \xe2\x80\x93 in the home and away legs of that campaign\xe2\x80\x99s group phase.</p> <p>Yet if Zabaleta is untrusted by the manager to combat Franck Rib\xc3\xa9ry down his flank, the way in which Sagna gave the ball away to him on occasion \xe2\x80\x93 and was unsteady at other times \xe2\x80\x93 suggested muddled thinking from Pellegrini.</p> <p>Sagna was replaced by Zabaleta in the 67th minute</p> 5) Eliaquim Mangala shows why he was bought for \xc2\xa332m <p>The hope for City is that this is the game the British record signing for a defender began to illustrate why he cost \xc2\xa332m.</p> <p>He made an impressive debut versus Chelsea apart, the 23-year-old has proved a liability more than asset and his start suggested the unwanted trend would continue.</p> <p>Here, Mangala made a glaring mistake that nearly gifted Bayern Munichs a chance but the riposte was to sort the act out in fine fashion as the Frenchman had a far better evening than Benatia, who City might have bought from Roma instead.</p> <p>Mangala produced one glorious ball that unleashed the Spaniard Jes\xc3\xbas Navas while also being City\xe2\x80\x99s most dependable presence at the back.</p> <p>Now, he needs to be so on a consistent basis.</p>'
