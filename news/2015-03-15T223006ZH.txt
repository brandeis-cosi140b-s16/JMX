b'Hull\xe2\x80\x99s Steve Bruce warns some players are damaging League\xe2\x80\x99s integrity'


b'<p>Players mobbing referees in simulated outrage with the object of getting a member of the opposition sent off could end up killing the goose laying those players all their lovely golden eggs, according to the Hull City manager, Steve Bruce.</p> <p>For Nigel Pearson, on the other hand, fear of being mobbed by reporters seemed to be the overriding emotion following this uninspiring stalemate. The Leicester manager was the subject of some heavy-handed mockery in Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s Sun newspaper regarding a tongue-in-cheek comment in the build-up about the possibility of the Foxes\xe2\x80\x99 fortunes changing with this week\xe2\x80\x99s new moon and he reacted unfortunately when one journalist used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwaxing and waning\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>After dismissing the question and standing up to leave the press conference, Pearson was picked up on the microphone describing the journalist concerned as a \xe2\x80\x9cprick\xe2\x80\x9d. Afterwards he was more considered. \xe2\x80\x9cThe players know we didn\xe2\x80\x99t really do enough to win the game. I\xe2\x80\x99d have liked to see us show a bit more intent and that\xe2\x80\x99s disappointing because we have been playing pretty well.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn some ways I could probably stomach us losing the game but being more positive trying to win it, than picking up a point but thinking we\xe2\x80\x99d probably been a bit safe.\xe2\x80\x9d Courting more controversy was probably the last thing Pearson needed with his side locked in a relegation struggle. In December he told a supporter to \xe2\x80\x9cfuck off and die\xe2\x80\x9d and was banned from the dugout for one game and fined \xc2\xa310,000. Last month there was the curious incident of the touchline strangulation when he grasped Crystal Palace\xe2\x80\x99s James McArthur by the throat.</p> <p>Meanwhile wWere Bruce to be playing these days, one suspects the centre-half, who made many a clattering tackle, would have to either change his game completely or find another living. While this very average game was robustly contested there was hardly a bad challenge to be seen and it was hard to understand how five Hull players could be booked. Tom Huddlestone, up to that point by some margin the man of the match, was sent off for a second yellow, leaving the Tigers needing to batten down the hatches in the final 20 minutes.</p> <p>One booking in particular, handed to Bruce\xe2\x80\x99s son Alex after he clearly took the ball in a tackle on Riyad Mahrez, led to his father\xe2\x80\x99s warning about players\xe2\x80\x99 conduct.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not even a foul but [the referee] is influenced by the reaction of the players, which is creeping into our game. I keep being accused of being a dinosaur, and fair enough, but the reason why the Premier League earns billions is the spectacle of the honesty and integrity.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re questioning it now with Chelsea in the European league, and when you see the antics with what goes on in Europe and all the rest of it I could take you to games when you\xe2\x80\x99d be bored out of your pants because there\xe2\x80\x99s no physicality in it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>And if that happens in the Premier League, said Bruce, the next TV deal might be a lot less lucrative. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we lose that, the honesty, then we\xe2\x80\x99ll lose all the millions and billions of pounds that everybody\xe2\x80\x99s enjoying at the minute because people around the world like to see it. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want any players of mine surrounding referees and asking for challenges to be sent off, and of course you have a word with them. They\xe2\x80\x99re professional people who want to win, I understand that, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see the nonsense creeping in to our game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Alex Bruce accepted that some might accuse Hull of having a bit of previous, having angrily surrounded the referee in their recent home game against Queens Park Rangers. The ensuing fracas resulted in the Rangers captain, Joey Barton, being dismissed for a sly punch on Huddlestone.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt does seem to be creeping into the game but Joey Barton will say we did it to try and get him sent off the other week,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bruce Jr. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is something you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see but when you get to this stage of the season and emotions are running high anyone will do anything to try and gain an advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Had Hull\xe2\x80\x99s Nikica Jelavic, in the first half, and Abel Hern\xc3\xa1ndez, in the final minutes, not missed gilt-edged opportunities to win the game Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s chances of avoiding relegation would be even slimmer.</p> <p>Man of the match Michael Dawson (Hull)</p>'
