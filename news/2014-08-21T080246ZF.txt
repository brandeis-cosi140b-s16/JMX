b'<p>Have the trampolines ready; the fireworks too. Something big is happening, something glorious, and it\xe2\x80\x99s happening at Liverpool, who are on the verge of replacing Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez with Mario Balotelli. Yes, it seems that Liverpool have had enough peace and quiet this summer after losing their lovable Uruguayan and are looking to do a loan deal with Milan for Balotelli, who must be itching to get back to these shores after having such a great time at Manchester City. It was all lies, he really did love us, he really did love England, despite always suggesting otherwise. And if the Balotelli deal falls through, Liverpool will turn their attention back to Monaco\xe2\x80\x99s Radamel Falcao.</p> <p>Chelsea officials have hypnotised Roma officials and are close to duping them into taking Fernando Torres off their hands and sending Mattia Destro to Stamford Bridge in return. The only stumbling block is thought to be whether Torres remembers to take his passport to the airport with him. Meanwhile Monaco are the latest club to show an interest in Petr Cech. Think about it Petr: sun, money, one of the finest stadiums in the world, Dimitar Berbatov.</p> <p>Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o has turned down a move to Ajax because he wants to go to Everton or Liverpool. He\xe2\x80\x99s not fussy, he just really wants to live on Merseyside as he\xe2\x80\x99s a huge fan of Brookside. Speaking of which, is that show still running?</p> <p>Newcastle are trying to keep a straight face as they demand \xc2\xa314m for Cheikh Tiot\xc3\xa9, a target for Lokomotiv Moscow.</p> <p>Manchester United are trying to keep a straight face as they pretend they would really, really, really, really, really like to sign a midfielder. Xabi Alonso is the latest player to be googled by Ed Woodward.</p> <p>Hull City were commended for their negotiating skills after selling Shane Long to Southampton for \xc2\xa312.5m. Now they want to spend \xc2\xa312m on Blackburn\xe2\x80\x99s Jordan Rhodes, a striker who has never played above the Championship. Figure that one out.</p> <p>Lukas Podolski will soon be taking selfies in Istanbul, with Arsenal \xe2\x80\x93 who are battling Everton for PSG midfielder Cl\xc3\xa9ment Chant\xc3\xb4me \xe2\x80\x93 ready to sell him to Galatasaray.</p>'
