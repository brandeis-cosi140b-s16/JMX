b'Real Madrid to face rivals Atl\xc3\xa9tico in Champions League quarter-finals'


b'<p>Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid and Real Madrid have been drawn against each other in the pick of the Champions League quarter-finals, a repeat of last season\xe2\x80\x99s final and the latest instalment in a rivalry that has already provided six meetings this season.</p> <p>Paris Saint-Germain play Barcelona with Porto versus Bayern Munich and Juventus against Monaco the other last-eight matches in the competition but it was the Madrid derby that emerged as the standout fixture from the draw at Uefa headquarters in Nyon.</p> <p>For Real it is arguably the tie they did not want. Although Carlo Ancelotti\xe2\x80\x99s side overcame Atl\xc3\xa9tico in the final last May, securing their 10th European Cup in the process, Diego Simeone\xe2\x80\x99s team have had the upper hand in recent meetings. Atl\xc3\xa9tico are unbeaten against Real this season. The Spanish champions have won both league matches against their rivals \xe2\x80\x93 thrashing Real 4-0 in February \xe2\x80\x93 and they also prevailed in the Spanish Super Cup at the beginning of the campaign and in the Copa del Rey in January.</p> <p>Simeone played down the draw and said he was focused on Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s league game against Getafe. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are three weeks left, almost a month, and there will be plenty of time for you to have fun talking about a game of such magnitude. But right now our life is La Liga.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Real director Emilio Butrague\xc3\xb1o said: \xe2\x80\x9cAtl\xc3\xa9tico are a competitive side. We have faced each other a lot this season and know each other well. They\xe2\x80\x99re a side who know how to compete, they don\xe2\x80\x99t concede many goals, are good from set pieces and get the best out of every situation.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>No English side remain in the Champions League; the quarter-final first legs are scheduled for 14-15 April and the return legs will be held on 21-22 April.</p> <p>Barcelona, who advanced past Manchester City, will play PSG in the last eight for the second time in three years, having also met them in the group stage. Zlatan Ibrahimovic will be suspended for the first leg after being sent off against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the last 16 but the striker was also absent when PSG beat Barcelona 3-2 in September.</p> <p>Bayern Munich have not lost a match against a Portuguese team since the 1987 European Cup final against Porto and the task facing their opponents is daunting. Pep Guardiola\xe2\x80\x99s side are 11 points clear in the Bundesliga and, having beaten Shakhtar Donetsk in the previous round, are regarded by many as favourites to win the European Cup.</p> <p>Their captain, Philipp Lahm, said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe could have drawn a more uncomfortable opponent. But Porto reached the quarter-finals in convincing style and they showed their quality. Porto are a technically strong side, they don\xe2\x80\x99t just defend with a deep line but want to take the initiative as well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Monaco, who knocked out Arsenal, have never lost to an Italian side in Monte Carlo and face Juventus. The Bianconeri will be expected to prevail, however, although their coach, Massimiliano Allegri, tweeted on Friday: \xe2\x80\x9cA hard quarter-final, Monaco are a dangerous side who showed their quality against Arsenal.\xe2\x80\x9d Juventus will be without the midfielder Paul Pogba for seven weeks after the Frenchman injured a hamstring against Borussia Dortmund.</p> <p>In the Europa League quarter-finals, the holders Sevilla face Andr\xc3\xa9 Villas-Boas\xe2\x80\x99 Zenit St Petersburg, Wolfsburg play Napoli, Club Brugge take on Dnipro and Dynamo Kyiv \xe2\x80\x93 who beat Everton on Thursday \xe2\x80\x93 meet Fiorentina. The first legs are scheduled for 16 April with the return fixtures a week later on 23 April.</p> Champions League quarter-final draw <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Paris Saint-Germain v Barcelona</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid v Real Madrid</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Porto v Bayern Munich</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Juventus v Monaco</p>     The draw for the Champions League 2014-15 quarter-finals.
