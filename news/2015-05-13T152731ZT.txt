b'The Fiver | Pep. Pep! Pep! Oh, Pep! Oh, Pep. Pep. Poor Pep'


b'<p>BYE-RN</p> <p>As those of you who have been reading the world\xe2\x80\x99s most unfunny tea-time email for however many years it is since the lame gags and unconvincing links began, even a genius can get it wrong from time to time. Take that sentence, for instance. It was terrible. A classic example of how not to write something satirical. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t even get close to laughing, did you. You didn\xe2\x80\x99t even get close to a t1tter. If there was a textbook for this kind of thing, that sentence would appear next to a man with a frowny face, holding two thumbs down. It happens, even to the best of us. The Fiver can\xe2\x80\x99t think of anything funny to say, which essentially makes it redundant given that\xe2\x80\x99s its job. Ah well. Nothing you can do about it anyway, you\xe2\x80\x99re not The Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s boss, and The Man is too busy hoping no one notices that he spends his days playing solitaire and scouring the internet for a captain\xe2\x80\x99s armband he can wear with pride around the office.</p> <p>Geniuses cannot genius every day, especially when they come up against geniuses who are able to genius that bit better than them. Now, Pep \xe2\x80\x9cPep\xe2\x80\x9d Guardiola is widely regarded as the finest manager in the world. Chairmen want to have him, players want to play for him, journalists and hipsters alike want to be on first-name terms with him. Pep. Pep! Pep! Oh, Pep! Oh, Pep. Pep. Poor Pep. In the end, his touchline schemings were no match for the majesty of Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez and Neymar. Actually, that\xe2\x80\x99s not right. From the start, his touchline schemings were no match for the majesty of Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant front three of Lionel Messi, Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez and Neymar. Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s better.</p> <p>It was a chastening Big Cup exit for Bayern Munich, made all the more harrowing by the hope that cruelly presented itself to them when Mehdi Benatia headed them into the lead after seven minutes. Briefly, agonisingly, they dreamt of clawing back that 3-0 deficit from the first leg, but it was not to be. Although Bayern won 3-2 on the night, Barcelona led 5-1 on aggregate by the 29th minute, two goals from Neymar ending the tie as a contest, and the Germans were only allowed back into the match after their opponents pressed the snooze button at half-time.</p> <p>Both of Neymar\xe2\x80\x99s goals were set up by Su\xc3\xa1rez, although the pre-assist, to use the language of the internet tactician, came from Messi. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is back, he is there where I had the privilege to train him,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Pep said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is definitely back at his best.\xe2\x80\x9d And helped, it must be said, by the comical state of Bayern\xe2\x80\x99s defence, who appeared to mistake the 5ft 6in Messi for an Argentinian Andy Carroll when he was allowed to nod Su\xc3\xa1rez through in the build-up to Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s second goal. Ultimately Bayern\xe2\x80\x99s shambolic defending was secondary to the story of Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s attacking class. They were deserving winners and their manager, Jose Enrique or something, or Anthony, has led them to their first Big Cup final in four years. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Bar\xc3\xa7a have the ball they are extremely strong,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Pep said. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope in Berlin they can win the fifth [Big] Cup.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Tonight Barcelona will find out whether Real Madrid or Plucky Little Juventus will be their opponents on 6 June. Plucky Little Juventus, in the unlikely role of neutrals\xe2\x80\x99 favourites, have a 2-1 lead to protect at the Bernab\xc3\xa9u and they will fancy their chances. Real are teetering. The title is slipping away \xe2\x80\x93 Barcelona could win La Liga on Sunday \xe2\x80\x93 and ruction is in the air, with Gareth Bale\xe2\x80\x99s Mr 15%, Jonathan Barnett, putting the Welshman\xe2\x80\x99s sketchy form down to his team-mates refusing to pass to him. \xe2\x80\x9cReal have to work with Gareth and pass the ball to him more,\xe2\x80\x9d Barnett roared. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s going to be the best player at Real Madrid when his team-mates work with him and help him. Hopefully Real will come to terms with this. It\xe2\x80\x99s plain to see when you watch the games.\xe2\x80\x9d Carlo Ancelotti\xe2\x80\x99s eyebrow almost went through the roof. </p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Jacob Steinberg from 7.45pm BST for MBM coverage of Real Madrid 1-1 Juventus (2-3 on agg).</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhile she gets a three-match ban I, in effect, get a 15-game ban in the league as well as cup games. She\xe2\x80\x99s clearly not good enough to be playing at this level. Sure, she apologised as I got stretchered off and Sunderland subsequently apologised to Arsenal. That\xe2\x80\x99s all well and good but she should be thinking more about how to tackle, not how to apologise\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Arsenal Ladies forward Kelly Smith fumes at Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s Abby Holmes, whose challenge left the former England player needing surgery on ankle-gah!</p>     Abby Holmes slides in on Kelly Smith.

Many, many years ago I applied for industrial scholarships before going to university. Attending an interview for one firm held in a London hotel, I said that I\xe2\x80\x99d been offered a place at a number of universities but only had a refusal from one \xe2\x80\x93 Bradford. Asked how I felt about this I replied that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really fancy spending any time in Bradford anyway. Informed that the headquarters of the company was actually in Bradford I resolved to do better homework in future \xe2\x80\x93 and then left\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Gerald Kreinczes.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDid Leo Roberts get the job?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Mark Jeffries.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHow dare you start off a Fiver with an 18-line paragraph of impenetrable bafflegab!
