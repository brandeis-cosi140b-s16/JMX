b'<p>Manchester City are in advanced discussions to sign Wilfried Bony from Swansea City in a deal worth around \xc2\xa325m.</p> <p>The striker is due to join up with the Ivory Coast for the Africa Cup of Nations, meaning he may be unavailable until the middle of next month, but Manuel Pellegrini has moved due to having only three front-line strikers in Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic.</p> <p>Ag\xc3\xbcero and Dzeko are currently injured, and Jovetic has failed to impress recently, so the manager has been forced to field James Milner as a No9 for some games.</p> <p>Pellegrini has decided that after drawing level with Chelsea in the title race and having Barcelona in the last-16 of the Champions League there is a need to strengthen.</p>  <p> Related: Deal or no deal: the out-of-contract football stars available for free this summer | Paul Doyle </p> '
