b'Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid v Real Madrid: Copa del Rey \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened | Michael Butler'


b'<p>A very Atl\xc3\xa9tico performance: they got their goals from a penalty and a corner, before strangling the game. Nobody does it better, and Real simply had no answer, resorting to long-range strikes and hopeful crosses. Ancelotti\xe2\x80\x99s men are going to have to think of new ways to score at least twice at the return leg at the Bernab\xc3\xa9u.</p> <p>Atl\xc3\xa9tico made eight changes from the team that beat Levante at the weekend, and that rotation means they should be fresh for Barcelona this coming weekend. All in all, an excellent night\xe2\x80\x99s work. But I\xe2\x80\x99m giving all the credit to Fernando Torres and Simeone\xe2\x80\x99s ballboy son, even though neither had any effect on the result, because I can.</p>     Guess who\xe2\x80\x99s back with a brand new rap?
