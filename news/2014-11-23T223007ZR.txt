b'<p>Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez has a capacity to see the best in everyone and that certainly extends to the man who launched his career in English football and gave him the chance to manage in the Premier League.</p> <p>The Wigan owner, Dave Whelan, has vowed to resign as the Championship club\xe2\x80\x99s chairman if the Football Association punishes him for making racist remarks about Chinese and Jewish people but the Everton manager is adamant that his old ally does not discriminate against anyone.</p> <p>Mart\xc3\xadnez, whose relationship with Whelan dates back almost 20 years since he was signed as a 21-year-old midfielder, said: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a special person who has never had a problem with the way he has helped communities, and as a football man the record is there for everyone to check.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Whelan made Mart\xc3\xadnez Wigan\xe2\x80\x99s first foreign manager in 2009 and the Spaniard rewarded him by winning the FA Cup 18 months ago. He defended the 77-year-old, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cYou need to understand the person and also that Wigan Athletic has very strong values. Everyone is welcome there. The chairman has a career to show that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Yet Wigan\xe2\x80\x99s values have been questioned after Malky Mackay, the subject of an ongoing investigation for exchanging allegedly racist, sexist and homophobic texts with the former Cardiff City head of recruitment Iain Moody, was named their manager last Wednesday. Whelan\xe2\x80\x99s comments have been condemned by organisations in both the Chinese and the Jewish communities, while Lord Ouseley, chairman of the anti-racism body Kick It Out, said on Sunday yesterday it was up to the FA to decide whether he was a fit person to run a club. Mart\xc3\xadnez has no doubts Whelan is suitable. He explained: \xe2\x80\x9cHe really is a good-natured person. You need to look behind the situation at the person. You have a chairman who just wants to support his new manager.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Less controversially, Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s ability to see things in a different light extended to his strike force. He almost doubled Everton\xe2\x80\x99s previous transfer record, the \xc2\xa315m Marouane Fellaini cost, to spend \xc2\xa328m on Romelu Lukaku but the Spaniard believes he has acquired a potent forward line for a bargain price.</p> <p>The Belgian set Everton on their way to victory against West Ham while he and the influential substitute Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o combined to supply Leon Osman for his winner, following an equaliser from Mauro Z\xc3\xa1rate. \xe2\x80\x9cWe bring Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o in on a free then Romelu on \xc2\xa325m plus \xc2\xa33m [in add-ons],\xe2\x80\x9d Mart\xc3\xadnez added. \xe2\x80\x9cTo get those two for that money, I think, is very, very cheap.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It is an indication of football\xe2\x80\x99s changing economics but as the Manchester clubs, Arsenal, Chelsea, Tottenham and Liverpool can all field a more expensive attacking duo, Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s maths are not as outlandish as they may appear. Moreover, he insisted, the profitable sale of Fellaini for \xc2\xa327.5m and his cost-free additions enable him to balance the books, even with the outlay on Lukaku. He said: \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s, how do you produce the finances? We produced our money by selling some players and by signing some on a free.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Meanwhile, another embodiment of the sums strikers can fetch made an encouraging first start of the season in the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 attack. Andy Carroll\xe2\x80\x99s previous two transfers amount to over \xc2\xa350m yet the man who remains both Liverpool and West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s record signing was only playing because Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia were injured. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have put big pressure on Andy,\xe2\x80\x9d his manager, Sam Allardyce, said. The target man may have commanded ample fees but cuts a slimline figure. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has had so much work done on his life,\xe2\x80\x9d Allardyce added. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has got a fiancee who is the owner of a yoga gym.\xe2\x80\x9d Carroll, then, may yet be a striker for the new age, even if Whelan\xe2\x80\x99s words this week were sadly antiquated.</p> <p>Man of the Match Leon Osman (Everton)</p>'
