b'Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s plan marries on-field success with off-field vision | Jamie Jackson'


b'<p>Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s motto is Superbia in proelia. Yet as the club, formed in 1880 as St Mark\xe2\x80\x99s, mature under Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nayan\xe2\x80\x99s City Football Group, the Pride in Battle axiom might be followed by a another maxim: only trophies matter.</p> <p>This is how one high-ranking executive characterised to the Guardian the overriding philosophy for City as the former \xe2\x80\x9cnoisy neighbours\xe2\x80\x9d move forward from the early years \xe2\x80\x93 when being noticed was what mattered \xe2\x80\x93 to focus solely on success and global domination.</p> <p>Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s visit of Tottenham Hotspur comes in a big week for Mansour\xe2\x80\x99s project. On Wednesday, Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s squad assembled for the first time at the club\xe2\x80\x99s new bespoke, state\xe2\x80\x91of-the-art \xc2\xa3100m-plus City Football Academy. A day later, Manchester City Women broke Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s three\xe2\x80\x91year domination of the Super League Continental Cup in a 1-0 win that was reward for the club\xe2\x80\x99s serious investment in the women\xe2\x80\x99s game. Saturday is about keeping Chelsea, who lead the Premier League by five points, in sight before Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s must-win Champions League game at CSKA Moscow.</p> <p>Claiming the European Cup is a central part of City\xe2\x80\x99s strategy for the next half-decade, while Sheikh Mansour, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, his chairman, and Ferran Soriano, the chief executive, have laid out their blueprint in five-year cycles.</p> <p>Mansour bought City in summer 2008. The trophy haul until summer 2013 was one Premier League and one FA Cup, with Champions League football being achieved for the first time. During this \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome to Manchester\xe2\x80\x9d period the volatile Carlos Tevez, Roberto Mancini and Mario Balotelli were the poster boys for the upstarts across town from Manchester United, whose then manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, compared City to the mob next door who have started making a racket. By the beginning of last season Tevez, Mancini and Balotelli had departed. In place as manager was the genteel Pellegrini, whose ambivalent attitude to the media is a sign he would rather be working with his squad than answering questions about them.</p> <p>By the close of Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s debut campaign he won the Premier League title and Capital One Cup, the same yield as Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho in his first year at Chelsea. The second title in three seasons was nearly as exhilarating as City\xe2\x80\x99s final-day triumph in 2011-12 yet the media coverage was muted. While this may, in part, have been a corollary of the focus on Liverpool coming close to breaking a 24-year championship drought, it was noted at the highest level of the club with a shrug. City\xe2\x80\x99s fourth league crown marked mission accomplished for the opening part of the executive\xe2\x80\x99s second five-year plan. A major part of this is the CFA and the hope of developing a constant stream of homegrown youngsters who are ready for the first team.</p> <p>Although Brian Marwood, as academy director, heads the CFA operation, reporting directly to Soriano, it is Patrick Vieira, the elite development manager, who could one day replace Pellegrini. If Vieira does become the No1 it may not be as his immediate successor. City\xe2\x80\x99s ideal candidate is Pep Guardiola, as recent revelations in a book of the Spaniard\xe2\x80\x99s first season at Bayern Munich confirmed. Unlike when Mancini led City to the title two years ago a clue to the succession plan may be seen in Pellegrini not being instantly offered a new contract. The Chilean is approaching the midway point of a three-year deal and will be close to 64 when this ends in the summer of 2016.</p> <p>Mubarak and Soriano could have other reasons for not extending Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s contract. Mancini\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent crash-and-burn may be causing caution. Yet as Guardiola is only 43 and a former supremely successful coach of Barcelona, the club City view as the ideal model, the Spaniard appears by far the best choice.</p> <p>The timescale offered for the CFA to begin a rich harvest of young elite players by Txiki Begiristain, the director of football (like Soriano, formerly at Barcelona), is two or three years. By then there is confidence that some of those who are performing at the CFA\xe2\x80\x99s new 7,000-seat facility will regularly make the jump to the first team.</p> <p>What City want to achieve is a permanent place among the elite. A first European Cup is the ambition for the next half-decade, with at least four semi-finals during this timescale the benchmark. The club also want to retain the Premier League, joining United and Chelsea in that feat. As with Liverpool in the 1970s and 1980s and United in the 1990s and noughties, City are serious about dominating domestically and on the continent. Being noisy neighbours is for the immature. There are far grander prizes to be claimed than local bragging rights over United.</p>            <p>Part of the attraction of replacing Mancini with Pellegrini was the lack of off-message incidents and headlines the Chilean creates. So, too, the offloading of Balotelli and Tevez: two players whose characters made controlling the new City message near-impossible.</p> <p>The on-field ambition is married to an off-field vision. Last year Abu Dhabi was accused of using \xe2\x80\x9cCity to launder the reputation of the country\xe2\x80\x9d by Human Rights Watch, which claimed Mansour\xe2\x80\x99s homeland is a \xe2\x80\x9cblack hole\xe2\x80\x9d for human rights, but the club continue to establish themselves as the hub of their community, having begun building the area\xe2\x80\x99s first sixth-form college and donating \xc2\xa33m towards local leisure facilities.</p> <p>This ethos is summed up by Mubarak, Mansour\xe2\x80\x99s man on the ground. \xe2\x80\x9cThe club has made no secret of the fact that winning championships is at the heart of its strategy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in City\xe2\x80\x99s most recent annual report. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, we are also seeking to create teams that play creative, entertaining football, and at the same time to continue to build a socially responsible and commercially successful off-field operation to harness the opportunities generated by our on-pitch performance.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the model for a successful and sustainable football club and it is one we continue to pursue in all aspects of our operations. Rapidly expanding our global presence remains a priority.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>While this last comment refers to City\xe2\x80\x99s growing portfolio of clubs that includes a majority stake in New York City FC and Melbourne City FC plus a minority interest in Japan\xe2\x80\x99s Yokohoma F Marinos, the jewel in the crown is the CFA. A two-year build has resulted in a centre that can claim to be the world\xe2\x80\x99s premier facility \xe2\x80\x93 in any sport. Once completed, which should be in November, Vincent Kompany and his squad, City Women, the junior teams and various staff will enjoy a site with 16\xc2\xa0full-sized fields, a Fifa regulation indoor pitch, a stadium and a superb training, medical and operational complex.</p> <p>Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the best facility in the world. We have all what you need to work in every sense. I am sure it is a very big step for this club to continue growing every day as they want.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of the women\xe2\x80\x99s triumph he said: \xe2\x80\x9cThis club wants to improve every day in every different area, in women, professional football, in young players. The best way to test if you are really improving is winning titles.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Work has also begun on expanding the Etihad Stadium to a 60,000-seat arena. Mubarak said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are already seeing results from investment in our academy in recent years. The development of homegrown youth talent into first-team players \xe2\x80\x93 a stated aim at the time of the club\xe2\x80\x99s acquisition \xe2\x80\x93 remains an achievable ambition in the years ahead.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>One person who worked on construction of the CFA site, part of the larger Etihad Campus, describes it \xe2\x80\x9cas out of this world\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>This is a fair evaluation of City\xe2\x80\x99s ambition.</p>'
