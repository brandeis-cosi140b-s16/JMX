b'<p>Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech has said he has \xe2\x80\x9cno reason to panic, pack up and leave\xe2\x80\x9d Stamford Bridge, but would \xe2\x80\x9cnot exclude anything\xe2\x80\x9d after beginning the season on the substitutes\xe2\x80\x99 bench.</p> <p>Thibaut Courtois has been selected in Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s starting XI by Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho in their first three league games \xe2\x80\x93 a situation reminiscent of when Cech was installed as the club\xe2\x80\x99s No1 ahead of the established Carlo Cudicini after his signing from Rennes in June 2004.</p> <p>Speaking while on national team duty with the Czech Republic before Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s friendly with the USA, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been at the club for 10 years, the situation [of being on the bench] is now new to me. The three opening matches I could not play for the team. I have no reason to panic, pack up and leave. I am a Chelsea player, where I have two more years of contract.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>However, the 32-year-old went on to confuse matters, stating that \xe2\x80\x9cthe offer would have to be right\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn football, nothing can be predicted in advance, nothing is ever perfect,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cech. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of players go on representative duty, yet still many transfer clubs. The offer would have to be right for everyone. I do not exclude anything [or] know the answer.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ashley Cole and Frank Lampard \xe2\x80\x93 two other mainstays of the Chelsea side Cech has been part of for 10 years \xe2\x80\x93 left during the summer, showing Mourinho has little room for sentiment in his second spell as Chelsea manager.</p> <p>David Luiz, Romelu Lukaku, Demba Ba and Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o have also departed, with Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my almost certainly Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s final addition of the transfer window.</p> <p>Mourinho had long stated that the window was closed for the club, having completed deals for Diego Costa, Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas, Filipe Lu\xc3\xads and the returning Didier Drogba in the summer.</p> <p>Fernando Torres\xe2\x80\x99s departure to Milan for the final two years of his five-and-a-half-year Chelsea contract \xe2\x80\x93 in effect ending his time at Stamford Bridge following his \xc2\xa350m move from Liverpool in January 2011 \xe2\x80\x93 necessitated the arrival of another striker, but even then Mourinho moved swiftly to sign R\xc3\xa9my from QPR for a reported fee of \xc2\xa310.5m.</p> <p>Many of those not in contention for a first-team place have left on loan \xe2\x80\x93 21 in all after Marco van Ginkel, the midfielder who spent most of last season out with a serious knee injury, joined Torres in Milan.</p> <p>The Dutchman\xe2\x80\x99s departure means Chelsea fulfil the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s homegrown player rule and will have the maximum 17 foreign players in their 25-man squad. Of the loan departures only Patrick Bamford, whose initial loan to Middlesbrough runs until January, did not leave on a season-long deal.</p>'
