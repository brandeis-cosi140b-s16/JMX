b'Football transfer rumours: Steven Gerrard to Internazionale?'


b'<p>Southampton want to bolster their unlikely assault on the Champions League places with the Dutch defender Bruno Martins Indi, even though he only left Feyenoord to join Porto in July. He seems particularly sought-after by coaching compatriots, with Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s Louis van Gaal ready to rival the Saints\xe2\x80\x99 Ronald Koeman for the multi-surnamed ace.</p> <p>The race is on to sign Dortmund\xe2\x80\x99s Marco Reus, with Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Real Madrid (in alphabetical order) all circling. Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho is hoping that an offer of Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle in part-exchange will swing a deal in his favour. Manchester United could use similar tactics to trump a handful of predictable mega-rich Premier League sides to the signing of Real\xe2\x80\x99s Gareth Bale, with the Spanish side \xe2\x80\x93 whose B team gave Zinedine Zidane\xe2\x80\x99s son a debut over the weekend \xe2\x80\x93 having the name of United goalkeeper David de Gea at the very top of their shopping list. Talking of Bale, this morning\xe2\x80\x99s Metro reveals \xe2\x80\x9cwhy Bale won\xe2\x80\x99t sign for Chelsea\xe2\x80\x9d. Somewhat disappointingly, the rather prosaic reason is that he\xe2\x80\x99d be much too expensive.</p> <p>Talking of extraordinarily expensive things, Arsenal and United are also both keen on Reus\xe2\x80\x99s Borussia Dortmund team-mate, the defender Mats Hummels, and will be encouraged to hear that he is semi-officially for sale. They will be less encouraged to hear that the asking price is an ambitious \xc2\xa347m. This is approximately double Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s January transfer budget, so it\xe2\x80\x99s probably safe to rule them out of the running. In other United news, the Telegraph exclusively reveal \xe2\x80\x9cthe truth behind Radamel Falcao\xe2\x80\x99s fitness woes\xe2\x80\x9d. And the truth is, he\xe2\x80\x99s fine. Relax.</p> <p>Tottenham scouts were in Argentina this week to eye up the Colombia striker Te\xc3\xb3 Guti\xc3\xa9rrez, a man previously fined for \xe2\x80\x9cinciting mass disorder\xe2\x80\x9d, and who once pulled a gun on a team-mate he didn\xe2\x80\x99t much like (and as a result had to make his own way to and from matches as nobody would sit on the same bus as him). Apparently, though he didn\xe2\x80\x99t score, the 29-year-old played well enough to have impressed, so British fans \xe2\x80\x93 and armed police \xe2\x80\x93 should brace themselves for fun times ahead. Apparently River Plate have set bail at a budget \xc2\xa35m. Spurs are also keen on West Bromwich Albion hotshot (not that way) Saido Berahino and still-crocked Saint Jay Rodriguez, but won\xe2\x80\x99t have enough cash unless someone spends serious money on Roberto Soldado.</p> <p>Newly-reappointed Internazionale coach Roberto Mancini is, according to the Mirror, \xe2\x80\x9cplanning a January spending spree in the Premier League\xe2\x80\x9d. Full details of the Italian\xe2\x80\x99s shopping list remain very much under wraps but Aleksandar Kolarov is believed to be on it, as are Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s Erik Lamela, Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Fabio Borini and Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Joel Campbell, with rumours also circulating that he may offer Steven Gerrard a chance to end his career in Italy.</p> <p>Napoli are quite keen on Lucas Podolski and may be confused by the mixed messages on the German\xe2\x80\x99s future today, with tuttomercatoweb saying he\xe2\x80\x99s available for just \xc2\xa34m, and the Mail reporting Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s bullish insistence that \xe2\x80\x9che is not for sale\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Yohan Cabaye isn\xe2\x80\x99t having a lot of fun at Paris St-Germain, say the Newcastle Chronicle, and may be open to a January return to England, with Liverpool and Arsenal both likely to be keen (according to apparently uninformed speculation from Chronicle columnist Olivier Bernard). \xe2\x80\x9cI am absolutely sure that he will be available in January and I\xe2\x80\x99m absolutely sure that he will be back in England next year,\xe2\x80\x9d crystal-balls Bernard.</p> <p>Sir Alex Ferguson is hoping to convince Uefa to instigate a significant rule change. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re looking at the possibility of introducing sin-bins like they have in rugby \xe2\x80\x93 a 10-minute suspension during the match,\xe2\x80\x9d he revealed. And in Dubai over the weekend, John Terry went scuba diving.</p>'
