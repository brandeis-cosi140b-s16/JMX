b'West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s Diafra Sakho may face FA charge for alleged butt on Luke Shaw'


b'<p>Diafra Sakho may face a Football Association charge after Luke Shaw suffered a black eye from an alleged butt from the West Ham United forward during Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 win on Saturday.</p> <p>The incident is thought to have occurred in the second half at Old Trafford. While Shaw could be seen complaining to the assistant referee, Andrew Garrett, it was shrugged off, with the left-back displeased with the response.</p> <p>This may suggest that if Sakho did strike Shaw, as is claimed, it was not seen by either Garrett, the match referee, Lee Mason, or any of the officials. If so, this is would allows the FA to investigate if they deem there is a case to answer. This would be done by examining television pictures to discover if there is any conclusive evidence.</p> <p>English football\xe2\x80\x99s governing body expect to have Mason\xe2\x80\x99s report on the match by Monday morning, so will decide if any further action is required then, and Shaw refused to discuss the incident. However, a source close to him claimed that Sakho had headbutted the defender during the game and left him unhappy over the incident.</p> <p>Shaw may have hinted at the episode when talking of Wayne Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s 60th-minute red card for hacking at Stewart Downing. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have actually had a lot of bad luck, especially with Wazza\xe2\x80\x99s red card, as I would say there was a handball before that but the referee didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop play,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cEarlier in the game, Sakho did the same to me but I just focus on winning games and I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep doing that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>If Sakho, a 24-year-old Senegal striker who scored West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s consolation goal at Old Trafford, was found guilty of the offence he would face a lengthy ban. Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Ramires received a four-match suspension for an off-the-ball incident in which he elbowed Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s Sebastian Larsson towards the end of last season. West Ham had not responded at the time of going to press.</p> <p>Shaw was finally making his debut for United after arriving in a \xc2\xa327m deal this summer from Southampton. The 19-year-old had been ruled out with a hamstring injury and he conceded: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a tough debut, I would say. Obviously, we went down to 10 men and it\xe2\x80\x99s never easy but we all fought hard and showed how much we wanted these three points. It means a lot to us. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad we got the three points in the end. Overall, I\xe2\x80\x99m really pleased with how my debut went but the main thing, for me, was to get the win.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Louis van Gaal criticised Shaw over his fitness during the club\xe2\x80\x99s summer tour of the US but the left-back stated he has a strong relationship with the manager. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, he was right to say that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe had a discussion in pre-season and the plan for me was to get my fitness up. It worked, I think, apart from the injury. It was a bit of a setback but I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked hard in the last weeks and had some talks. He\xe2\x80\x99s been a great inspiration to me and hopefully I can carry that on. For him to say I\xe2\x80\x99m an example at a massive club like this is something to be really happy about.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
