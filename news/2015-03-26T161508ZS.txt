b'NOT SINCE THE BLACK KNIGHT HAS ANYONE BEEN SO UNWILLING TO ADMIT FAILURE <p>In Spain, Marca refuse to give Gareth Bale a mark out of 10 because his performance is so poor, saying of him that \xe2\x80\x9cReal Madrid paid for a supercar but got a bicycle\xe2\x80\x9d; 68% of readers of AS say he should be dropped; and his car gets attacked by his own fans (Bale himself having paid for a supercar and got a supercar, which is just as well; if he\xe2\x80\x99d been on a bicycle he\xe2\x80\x99d have been in real trouble). Yet according to Sam Vokes, his Wales team-mate, there is \xe2\x80\x9cno difference in his confidence\xe2\x80\x9d and, just to reiterate, \xe2\x80\x9cno lack of confidence there\xe2\x80\x9d. </p> <p>It was on his long and painful introduction to the Tottenham team \xe2\x80\x93 when none of his first 24 appearances brought victory \xe2\x80\x93 that the Welsh wizard\xe2\x80\x99s footballing credentials were last questioned in this cruel manner. And Bale\xe2\x80\x99s response to that run? \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a bit annoying but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t affect me at all.\xe2\x80\x9d Not since Monty Python\xe2\x80\x99s Black Knight has anyone been so unwilling to admit failure. When Bale plays well, his confidence blossoms. When he plays badly, his confidence blossoms anyway. \xe2\x80\x9cIt happens in football,\xe2\x80\x9d Bale said of dips in form after last season\xe2\x80\x99s Big Cup final. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have days where you just miss a few chances, but the most important thing is that you don\xe2\x80\x99t let it hit your confidence.\xe2\x80\x9d </p> <p>As if it ever would. Bale\xe2\x80\x99s confidence is indestructible. Many centuries from now, when his body has crumbled and turned to dust, Bale\xe2\x80\x99s confidence will continue to roam the globe, optimism undimmed, insisting it\xe2\x80\x99s only a matter of time before his body pulls itself together and he retakes his place in football\xe2\x80\x99s pantheon. Wales could well attempt to qualify for the 2078 World Cup with Bale\xe2\x80\x99s confidence as their lone frontman, ghosting in at the far post (in the most literal sense) and attempting to force the ball into the net through sheer self-belief. Bale, in full physical form, will lead his nation into a vital Euro 2016 qualifier against Group B leaders Israel on Saturday, before packing his confidence up in an outsized designer suitcase and schlepping it back to Madrid, where it may well continue to take a pummelling but will certainly continue not to care about it. </p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cJoining Spurs was the hardest,\xe2\x80\x9d Bale said once, looking back over his career so far. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d gone from being a 16-year-old at Southampton to moving to Tottenham and playing with the likes of Berbatov and Keane. And I literally didn\xe2\x80\x99t know anybody at Spurs. Then you pick up an injury and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard. Medical people said I might not get back to the level I was at. It dented my confidence and made me go into my shell. But I worked harder and harder in training and tried to get my confidence back up. It takes time, but I got there and the rest is history.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Most players work on their free-kicks in training; they might head for the gym in an attempt to build up their quads. Gareth Bale worked on his confidence, as if it were just another part of his biology. And he\xe2\x80\x99s exercised it so often and so furiously that it\xe2\x80\x99s now swollen and solidified, straining against his skin like Arnold Schwarzenegger\xe2\x80\x99s bicep. The man is 6ft of solid swagger. \xe2\x80\x9cHe isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to care what I think about how he\xe2\x80\x99s playing,\xe2\x80\x9d says the Wales full-back Neil Taylor of the criticism. \xe2\x80\x9cI think he deals with it really well. He knows how good a player he is, it\xe2\x80\x99s as simple as that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Bale does indeed know how good a player he is, but it\xe2\x80\x99s anything but simple.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY 1 <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf he touched his balls, he has to be punished\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 the Spanish FA\xe2\x80\x99s president, Javier Tebas, wants Him to be sanctioned, not only for his \xe2\x80\x98calm down\xe2\x80\x99 celebration aimed at Bar\xc3\xa7a fans in the cl\xc3\xa1sico, but for also asking the referee if he liked the look of His knackers. </p> QUOTE OF THE DAY 2 <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was voted man of the match and my prize was two flights to New York. I never quite made it there, though \xe2\x80\x93 I gave the tickets to my sister instead. For me it was pretty much a perfect debut, apart from the fact my mum and dad were not there to see it because I only found out a few hours before kick-off that I was playing and it was impossible for them to get down from Newcastle to Wembley in time \xe2\x80\xa6 it did not stop me being dropped to the B team for England\xe2\x80\x99s next game, a friendly against Czechoslovakia a month later\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Alan Shearer explains how his \xe2\x80\x98perfect\xe2\x80\x99 England debut involved his parents being absent, a prize that was useless and him being dropped in the very next game.</p> FIVER LETTERS     West London \xe2\x80\x98dubes\xe2\x80\x99. Photograph: incamerastock / Alamy/Alamy    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI had very mixed expectations when I read the headline about Dion Dublin\xe2\x80\x99s Dube. When I was at school in west London, back in the day (way, way back), a dube was a slightly more raffish word for a johnny. Or, as I later found out it was called, a condom. So the promise of seeing Dion play it on stage promised much, much more than the video link actually delivered\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Charles Antaki.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou do a great disservice to Dion Dublin. His contribution to the success of Manchester United goes far beyond the number of games he played. If he had not broken his leg then the purse strings would not have been loosened to allow Eric Cantona to come to Old Trafford. Arguably therefore Dion Dublin was United\xe2\x80\x99s greatest ever player\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 John Stainton. </p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYesterday\xe2\x80\x99s oenophile correspondents are being a little harsh on Roger Perry. Of course Chablis is made from Chardonnay, (and Champagne is made with Chardonnay, and even Grand Cru red Burgundies can legitimately contain up to 15% Chardonnay) but when people refer to a bottle of wine as a Chardonnay they generally mean something that says Chardonnay in big letters in the middle of the label. It almost certainly won\xe2\x80\x99t be French (as they don\xe2\x80\x99t really allow that), and will quite likely be overpoweringly oaked. It may make a reasonable companion for bigger-flavoured fish like salmon or tuna. Or a fish pie. Not turbot\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Steve Allen.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPresumably \xe2\x80\x98to fart higher than your ass\xe2\x80\x99 (Fiver passim) implies arrogance because you are the sort of person who gets to ride on a donkey rather than walk beside it. Which is a colourful translation of \xe2\x80\x98p\xc3\xa9ter plus haut que son cul\xe2\x80\x99, but a more accurate one would use the first four letters of the club that Giroud plays for to mean \xe2\x80\x98cul\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Robin Hazlehurst.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThree letters about wines derived from the Chardonnay grape and one on French idioms? Good to see that Big Paper readership doesn\xe2\x80\x99t conform to predictable upper-middle class intellectual stereotypes, eh?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Roddy Cordeiro.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
