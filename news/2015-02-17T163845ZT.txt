b'<p>PSG AIN\xe2\x80\x99T GOT NO HISTORY</p> <p>Last week, the Fiver established beyond any shadow of a doubt, that Living Wage proselytiser Comrade Roman Abramovich is these days politically several shades of red to the left of the laissez-faire neo-bampots who run the Premier League. But the repositioning of the Chelsea brand doesn\xe2\x80\x99t end there! Because in Big Cup tonight, Abramovich\xe2\x80\x99s club, so often cast in the role of gauche arrivistes, find themselves in an unfamiliar position as the old-money grandees of the piece. Which is unquestionably what they\xe2\x80\x99ll be when compared to uber-nouveau-riche lottery-winning rabble Paris St-Germain, almost certainly the only people in France who don\xe2\x80\x99t know which knife and fork to pick up first with their big, clumsy, soil-shovelling hands.</p> <p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho is certainly to the manner born when it comes to delivering withering verdicts with a haughty sniff, and ahead of tonight\xe2\x80\x99s class war, he firmly put PSG in their place. \xe2\x80\x9cI know the PSG project well because when they started this project, I was to be the coach,\xe2\x80\x9d the little lord revealed. \xe2\x80\x9cI met them in Qatar. It was not the right moment for me. But Paris is a big team with big ambitions.\xe2\x80\x9d As ever, Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s compliment was a perfectly timed back-handed slap, for what he was actually highlighting in that last line was PSG\xe2\x80\x99s relative failure in Europe, and heaping the pressure on accordingly. \xe2\x80\x9cThe project was to start dominating in France and to dominate in Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, before letting the following line hang: \xe2\x80\x9cThe domination in France is there.\xe2\x80\x9d At which point PSG coach Laurent Blanc should have parried with a witty rejoinder, but he was too busy blowing his nose into his napkin.</p> <p>In fairness, Blanc probably was wise not to get involved in a slanging match with Mourinho, the provocateur supreme, and a man recently described by France Football as L\xe2\x80\x99Emmerdeur. That monicker, with fascistic firewalls in mind, cannot be translated literally by your favourite unfunny daily email, suffice to say Mourinho has been accused of gleefully stirring the rather unpleasant contents of a pot; of the deliberate and provocative rearrangement of waste product; of jobby juggling. Vulgar, nay d\xc3\xa9class\xc3\xa9, language from a normally elegant periodical. The Fiver is aghast, ready to swoon, overcome by vapours. Mourinho, however, was unperturbed, and finished with a flourish, promising that \xe2\x80\x9cwe are not going to see the best Diego Costa\xe2\x80\x9d in the wake of his three-game domestic ban for strolling up and down Emre Can. Another statement tinged with knowing disingenuousness, there, given Costa will be up against a defence marshalled by former Chelsea music-hall act David Luiz. As PSG might find to their cost tonight, even for \xc2\xa350m, you can\xe2\x80\x99t buy class.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT! <p>Join Scott Murray for PSG 1-1 Chelsea and Ian McCourt for Shakhtar 1-3 Bayern at 7.45pm.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY     Arrigo Sacchi has denied making racist comments at an awards ceremony. Photograph: Pedro Armestre/AFP/Getty Images    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not racist \xe2\x80\xa6 but there are too many blacks in youth teams\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 as \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not racist buts\xe2\x80\x99 go, Arrigo Sacchi\xe2\x80\x99s is pretty spectacular. </p> YOUR MUNDANE ENCOUNTERS WITH FAMOUS PEOPLE GO ON \xe2\x80\xa6 AND ON \xe2\x80\xa6 AND ON <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI spent the summer of 2001 working on a farm in Essex, and one afternoon was required to rotavate a field by the M25, in front of what turned out to be Trevor Sinclair\xe2\x80\x99s house. His son came outside and rode in the tractor with me for a while, then asked (actually more demanded) for me to let him ride on the rotavator. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem pleased at my refusal despite me explaining that it would have led to certain death, and eventually jumped out and ran back to the house, whereupon Tricky Trev himself appeared at the door. As a West Ham fan my first instinct was to sprint up there and do a Wayne Campbell style \xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99re not worthy\xe2\x80\x99 at his feet for scoring the best goal I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen (the volley from Joe Cole\xe2\x80\x99s cross v Derby that beats his one for QPR hands down), but I restrained myself to a wave from the cab which he reciprocated. Good times\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Mark Jelbert.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cImagine our surprise when, as nine and seven year old whippersnappers respectively, my brother and I knocked on the door of my Nan\xe2\x80\x99s next door neighbour in 1987, only to have it opened by none other than PFA player of the year, John Barnes! Turns out he had popped around to have his haircut. He was a true gent, and invited us in, and let us wear his first England Cap. As a precocious youngster, I vaguely recall wanting to ask why he would have brought said cap around to that appointment, other than perhaps to cover up his new do!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Mike Hulse.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBack in the early 90\xe2\x80\x99s I was unfortunately laid up in Blackburn Infirmary after receiving an ACL replacement. Being a lifelong Blackburn Rovers supporter, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe my eyes, when who should walk in, on the way to his private room I hasten to add, but the great Alan Shearer. Apparently, he was in for an exploratory operation on his knee. I quickly asked the nurse if she could get an autograph for me. I had a look around, but the only thing I had at hand was the book I was reading at the time, Muhammad Ali by Thomas Hauser. The nurse duly obliged, and he kindly signed the book, which I still have tucked away somewhere. After this chance \xe2\x80\x98meeting\xe2\x80\x99, and using an extreme amount of poetic licence, over the next few years I went back to my home town club, who I helped manage to a league title. He went back to a small town club and helped them win the Premier league. I then moved to New Zealand and helped a small town club to the Premier League title. He then went back to his home town club and helped manage them to\xe2\x80\xa6 oh!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 David Warburton.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDuring the height of summer last year here in Berlin, my housemate and I attempted to move a sofa we had acquired to our house. Struggling with the unwieldy beast and the uncomfortable heat, I had a wee sit on the sofa by the side of the road, whilst my mate went around the corner to see how far the tram stop was. Up pulled a Range Rover containing a very attractive woman and Lukas Podolski, who gave me quite a dirty look, obviously perturbed to see a shirtless man sat on a sofa by the side of the road. My housemate returned with news of the trams, and was completely nonplussed by my encounter with a World Cup winner\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Michael Wood.</p> FIVER LETTER <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI bet Mark Ireland thought that the third string keeper for Canada\xe2\x80\x99s only World Cup team couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be beat for mundaneness, but apparently Sven Habermann has recently emerged from a lifetime of obscurity. He\xe2\x80\x99s invented a rapid pepper spray delivery system, obviously, and recently appeared on a popular Canadian TV show where would be inventors beg wealthy investors for money. They offered him a million dollars and he turned them down\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ian Gatensby.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
