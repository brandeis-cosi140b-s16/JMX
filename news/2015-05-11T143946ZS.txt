b'<p>It had all been a little too quiet at Schalke 04 recently. Down the road, Borussia Dortmund have made plenty of noise by falling from the table like a drunk uncle* you have to invite for dinner once a year, by getting their act together again and making it to the DFB Cup final for a chance to see J\xc3\xbcrgen Klopp depart as a hero, trophy in hand.</p> <p>Bayer 04 Leverkusen have won the neutrals\xe2\x80\x99 loud applause for fast, aggressive football under Roger Schmidt, and Borussia M\xc3\xb6nchengladbach (all but confirmed as direct qualifiers for the Champions League after the 3-0 win over Bayer) even more so for their little less fast, less aggressive but more successful performances under Lucien Favre. Big, clunky, headline-machine Bayern Munich, meanwhile, have either been praised as the best team the league has ever seen or written off as a side stuffed with over-the-hill veterans who no longer believe in the genius Pep Guardiola, depending on the exact time of the day.</p> <p>Surprisingly, however, there are still one or two former FC Bayern players who haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet offered their opinions on the matter. Hansi Dorfner, Berkant G\xc3\xb6ktan and Mazinho (no, not that Mazinho. The other Mazinho) please come forward immediately. The 24-hour news cycle needs you. And at the wrong end of the table, a full third of the league are fighting for survival in what is now officially the closest-fought relegation battle since ever\xe2\x84\xa2.</p> <p>The rest of the week in Germany will be taken up with Bayern\xe2\x80\x99s sensational resurrection or total destruction against Barcelona on Tuesday but today, at last, it\xe2\x80\x99s Schalke\xe2\x80\x99s day. The Royal Blues sensed there was an opportunity to seize the agenda following their abysmal 2-0 defeat at K\xc3\xb6ln (\xe2\x80\x9cthe worst game in years\xe2\x80\x9d, Julian Draxler called it) on Sunday evening and followed through with excellent timing, on Monday afternoon, a few minutes after Pep Guardiola had rubbished exclusive transfer gossip disseminated by BeIN Sports\xe2\x80\x99 resident wordsmith, Richard Keys.</p> <p>Kevin-Prince Boateng and Sidney Sam were put on indefinite gardening leave, the club announced on their website. The utility player Marco H\xc3\xb6ger was suspended for the next game on Saturday, against Paderborn. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was no longer a relationship of trust,\xe2\x80\x9d sporting director Horst Heldt declared with regard to the first two scapegoats, while H\xc3\xb6ger had had \xe2\x80\x9ca problem of loyalty\xe2\x80\x9d. All very oblique, you will agree, but not totally unexpected, after Heldt had threatened even more drastic if not quite legal levels of punishment the day before. \xe2\x80\x9cOne or two players who will not pull their weight won\xe2\x80\x99t survive the next training,\xe2\x80\x9d the 45-year-old had vowed, his voice crackling with murderous intent.</p> <p>Schalke\xe2\x80\x99s season is not quite dead yet. They\xe2\x80\x99re in sixth spot, clinging on to a Europa League place, despite only four wins since the winter break. But arch-rivals Dortmund are breathing down their necks only two points behind, eager to garnish Schalke\xe2\x80\x99s disappointment of missing out on next year\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League with acute embarrassment.</p> <p>Putting KPB, Sam and H\xc3\xb6ger out to pasture smacks of desperation and what Germans call Aktionismus \xe2\x80\x93 the art of doing something to be seen to be doing something. (\xe2\x80\x9cFlamini-ism\xe2\x80\x9d is apparently the equivalent term used in sections of north London) Schalke have gone down that road before as well. Jermaine Jones was cast as the chief culprit in previous years, and countless others have been accused of not wanting it enough as one manager after the other has failed to get the most out of a squad some believe to be the second-most expensive in the league.</p> <p>Wolfsburg might have overtaken them and Dortmund will come quite close in terms of wages, but S04 certainly spend very big money. In return, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been getting a hotch-potch of underwhelming results, Roberto Di Matteo tactically replaying the 2012 Champions League final over and over again (\xe2\x80\x9cTake that Augsburg and Freiburg \xe2\x80\x93 you won\xe2\x80\x99t score against us! Hahaha!\xe2\x80\x9d) and the team seemingly having not the faintest idea of what they are supposed to do with the ball.</p> <p>That\xe2\x80\x99s not all that much for a coach whose signing was cautiously welcomed as \xe2\x80\x9cthe greatest coup for the Bundesliga since Pep Guardiola\xe2\x80\x9d by the Schalke insider Alfred Draxler of Bild. But getting rid of yet another manager, the fifth one in as many years \xe2\x80\x93 interim coaches not included \xe2\x80\x93 would perhaps pose bigger, graver questions of the people in charge. So Royal Blues fans will have to make do with a Bauernopfer, three chess pawns sacrificed to protect king and queen on the board.</p> <p>*Not this column\xe2\x80\x99s uncle. He\xe2\x80\x99s lovely.</p> <p>Results: HSV 1-1 Freiburg, Dortmund 2-0 Hertha, Gladbach 3-0 Leverkusen, Hannover 1-1 Bremen, Frankfurt 3-1 Hoffenheim, Bayern 0-1 Augsburg, Stuttgart 2-0 Mainz, Paderborn 1-3 Wolfsburg, K\xc3\xb6ln 2-0 Schalke.</p>'
