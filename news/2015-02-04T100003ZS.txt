b'Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s signing of Ryan Bertrand has the look of a \xc2\xa310m bargain | Paul Doyle'


b'<p>Honestly, the way some fans get all het up about tradition, there would probably be uproar if Southampton changed their crest from a scarf, tree and water to a drumming badger-like creature with a giant scrotum. And yet the tanuki, as such animals are known in Japanese folklore, would be a fitting emblem for the current Southampton side because of the radical change in perception that they, too, have enjoyed.</p> <p>Once tanuki were seen as harbingers of woe but now they are considered totems of happy times and prosperity, which is why statues of them are frequently found at the entrances to Tokyo bars and restaurants. Admittedly, sewing images of the tanuki into Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s shirts would invite accusations of being wilfully abstruse, or a jackass, and therefore might not be in keeping with the shrewdness for which the club is now known. Not to worry, because this week Southampton bought a more obvious symbol of the good cheer ahead for the club, as their purchase of Ryan Bertrand was one of the smartest deals on transfer deadline day.</p> <p>That transfer was, of course, confirmation of the smartness of the original deal that brought Bertrand to St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s on loan last summer. Not that that acquisition was widely acclaimed as such at the time. In fact, grumbling among many Southampton supporters back then suggested that Bertrand\xe2\x80\x99s arrival was viewed as evidence of the club\xe2\x80\x99s withering, with a hot young star, Luke Shaw, being replaced on the never-never by a so-so journeyman who was embarking on his ninth loan spell away from Chelsea (whose purchase of Filipe Lu\xc3\xads carried old-school \xe2\x80\x9cevil tanuki\xe2\x80\x9d connotations for Bertrand).</p> <p>But Bertrand\xe2\x80\x99s performances since then have banished such chatter and, indeed, helped Southampton fans to forget about Shaw and remember why the former Chelsea manager Roberto Di Matteo declared in 2012 that giving Bertrand his Champions League debut in the final against Bayern Munich was not a gamble. Few Southampton fans would now argue that paying Chelsea around \xc2\xa310m to make Bertrand\xe2\x80\x99s move to St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s permanent is an ill-advised punt; many would call it a bargain.</p> <p>Bertrand has been brilliant this season. He and Nathaniel Clyne have unquestionably been among the best full-back pairings in the Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 possibly second only to Branislav Ivanovic and C\xc3\xa9sar Azpilicueta. Roy Hodgson could benefit from deploying them together on the international stage. It would be folly not to give Bertrand a chance to add to the two senior caps he earned nearly three years ago.</p> <p>Bertrand and Clyne may sound like a building society but investing in them is probably safer. Both are impeccable defenders and have helped Southampton to become the most robust defence in the Premier League. Clyne is a tougher and more prolific tackler but Bertrand is also solid (and usually tidy, the misjudgment that led to his dismissal against Swansea City on Sunday being untypical). Both are astute readers of the game. Their positioning is sound and their rate of interceptions very high. No winger has emerged on top from duels with either of them this season.</p> <p>No doubt the composure that helped convince Di Matteo that Bertrand would not quiver at being thrown into a Champions League final against Arjen Robben also endears the left-back to Ronald Koeman, who is rearing a team that plays with peppy intensity and unruffled purpose.</p> <p>While the full-backs are resolute in defence, their nifty and relentless attacking also makes them integral to Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s ability to unhinge opponents at the other end. They constantly lead counterattacks or provide reinforcements on the overlap and usually end their bursts with dangerous crosses or runs into the box or even a powerful shot \xe2\x80\x93 that spectacular right-footed half-volley that Bertrand scored with in the win at Crystal Palace was not precisely typical but did offer a convenient snapshot of the irresistible progress he has made this season.</p> <p>Too often there appear to be three stages for young English players at Premier League clubs: soaring talent; frustrated potential; and sad fall or low-level plateau. At 25, and despite suffering several jolts to his confidence in recent years, Bertrand seems well set to defy that trend by becoming a stalwart at a top club.</p> <p>As such, he also serves as a fine example to all the academy graduates streaming into Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s senior squad, not least Matt Targett, the highly promising 19-year-old who will probably replace Bertrand during his upcoming suspension for that red card against Swansea. Seven months ago Southampton sold the most highly rated young left-back in Britain; now their strength in that position looks secure for many years to come and they are \xc2\xa320m up on trading in that position. Happy times and prosperity.</p>'
