b'The Fiver | Stockpiling all its romance into inanimate objects'


b'<p>THE GREATEST LOVE OF ALL</p> <p>Tea-timely email tired of the monotony of life. Hopeless romantic. WLTM similar. Enjoys fibre-optic broadband, Homes Under The Hammer, and Tin. Available to meet most weeknights from (around) 5pm.</p> <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say that The Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s Guardian Soulmates profile didn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly set the internet alight. But having consulted the website\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Help\xe2\x80\x99 page, and taken the advice of its Casanova cousin Russellbrandybasedcocktailothario Fiver \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cjust be yourself\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 this came as a bit of a shock. The Fiver is being itself! The Fiver absolutely loves Homes Under The Hammer, especially now that Dion Dublin presents the ruddy thing! But romance \xe2\x80\x93 oh cruel tormentor! \xe2\x80\x93 continues to run dry, with any potential matches disappearing over the horizon faster than Dimitar Berbatov\xe2\x80\x99s hairline.</p> <p>Indeed, if only The Fiver had but a smidgen of the Bulgarian\xe2\x80\x99s panache and class, then perhaps it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t find itself in such a compromising position. Instead, The Fiver is forced to stockpile all its romance into inanimate objects, like a Subbuteo figurine of Glenn Hoddle, or a custard cream, or the FA Cup. In this last thing, at least, The Fiver is not alone, with Reading charmster Steve Clarke also doing his best to believe in the ROMANCE AND MAGIC AND HISTORY OF THE FA CUP before his side\xe2\x80\x99s semi-final with Arsenal on Saturday. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a great challenge for us, to give a little bit of excitement to the town,\xe2\x80\x9d he tub-thumped. \xe2\x80\x9cReading have never played in an FA Cup final. These players have a chance to make history \xe2\x80\x93 what an incentive. [The players] won\xe2\x80\x99t freeze and they won\xe2\x80\x99t have any regrets, I can promise you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It is perhaps unfortunate that Reading \xe2\x80\x93 who have conceded 16 goals in their last three encounters with Arsenal and failed to win any of their five Championship matches since last month\xe2\x80\x99s quarter-final win over Bradford City \xe2\x80\x93 face a team of superstars that have won eight on the bounce, but remember reader: form counts for nothing in these matches! That said, Clarke appears to be taking no chances and craftily identified something that his brave players must avoid against Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez and co.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNo mistakes,\xe2\x80\x9d he eureka-ed. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you make mistakes in possession and give the ball away to Arsenal they will punish you. If you make silly mistakes in and around your own box they have got players that will capitalise on those chances. I know that if we play the perfect game, then we have a chance to go through.\xe2\x80\x9d When questioned as to how many times his side have attained such a level, Clarke replied: \xe2\x80\x9cProbably none \xe2\x80\x93 so it\xe2\x80\x99s a big ask. But you have to ask it.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s the spirit Steve \xe2\x80\x93 the kind of optimism that gives The Fiver hope. Reading could yet reach their first ever FA Cup final. The Fiver could yet find love. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t ask, you don\xe2\x80\x99t get [rejected \xe2\x80\x93 Fiver Ed].</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think [our] membership is sending a clear message that we continue to support president Blatter\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Concacaf head Jeffrey Webb on the plaudits showered in Sepp\xe2\x80\x99s direction at this week\xe2\x80\x99s congress, among them Trinidad and Tobago FA president Raymond Tim Kee labelling him the \xe2\x80\x9cfather of football\xe2\x80\x9d, while Dominican Republic counterpart Osiris Guzman compared him to Moses, Abraham Lincoln, Winston Churchill, Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela and Jesus Christ. As you do.</p>      FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe it\xe2\x80\x99s just coincidence, but both players to have felt the sharp end of Joss Labadie\xe2\x80\x99s teeth (Ronnie Henry and Ollie Banks, yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Bits and Bobs) sound like they should be characters on EastEnders. If it\xe2\x80\x99s not a coincidence, AFC Wimbledon\xe2\x80\x99s Alfie Potter might want to check over his shoulder every now and then\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ben Graham.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDoes anyone know what error code -993imap.yahoo.com is?
