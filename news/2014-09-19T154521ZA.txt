b'Aston Villa v Arsenal: match preview'


b'<p>Aston Villa have started strongly with 10 points from 12 and a victory at Anfield. They sit in second behind Chelsea and despite having registered only six shots on target will fancy their chances of causing another upset. They have kept a clean sheet in three of their four games to date \xe2\x80\x93 the same cannot be said for Arsenal who have conceded a headed goal in all four games and may also be suffering from a Champions League hangover coming into this.
