b'The Fiver | The BBC\xe2\x80\x99s notoriously unreconstructed management class of the 1970s'


b'AT LAST! THE 1978 SHOW! <p>The Black and White Minstrel Show was first transmitted by the BBC in 1958. The series was cancelled, a mere 20 years after it should have been, in 1978. The Fiver recalls this infamous variety hit not so much to illustrate modern Britain\xe2\x80\x99s healthier and more enlightened attitude to matters of race \xe2\x80\x93 though the juxtaposition does achieve that \xe2\x80\x93 but rather to suggest, if even the BBC\xe2\x80\x99s notoriously unreconstructed management class of the 1970s could work out that crude racial stereotyping wasn\xe2\x80\x99t acceptable as light entertainment, institutions in 2014 probably should know better than to pass off discriminatory text messages as nothing more than jovial patter.</p> <p>Oh League Managers\xe2\x80\x99 Association! How could you? Why, only yesterday the Fiver voiced the hope that any public defence of former Cardiff City manager Malky Mackay and his former head of recruitment Iain Moody, accused of sending bigoted nonsense to each other via SMS, would be \xe2\x80\x9cslightly more nuanced than pleas of \xe2\x80\x98Bantz!\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d Did we really think anybody in the real world would say something similarly bereft of wit, intelligence and self-awareness? Well, yes, this is football after all. \xe2\x80\x9cThese were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text-message banter,\xe2\x80\x9d the LMA announced last night in an otherwise apologetic statement which, if nothing else, gave the dolt who wrote it the chance to have some more practice this morning when penning the inevitable apology for the apology.</p> <p>The LMA\xe2\x80\x99s buffoonery has given the folk at Cardiff an opportunity to seize the moral high ground, a rare one of late and not one they\xe2\x80\x99re inclined to pass up. Pointing out that the club informed the LMA about the texts \xe2\x80\x9cover three months ago\xe2\x80\x9d, since when nothing had been done, they were \xe2\x80\x9cunder a duty to report their findings to the FA\xe2\x80\x9d and that the LMA was, as a result of its masterclass in foot-dragging, \xe2\x80\x9ccomplicit in the attempt to conceal these messages\xe2\x80\x9d. Furthermore, Cardiff also \xe2\x80\x9cfind it entirely reprehensible that the LMA should itself put out a statement which seeks to dismiss deeply offensive racist comments as \xe2\x80\x98friendly banter\xe2\x80\x99. If that is the view held by the LMA, as appears from its statement, we consider that [top LMA suit] Richard Bevan\xe2\x80\x99s position is untenable and we call for his resignation.\xe2\x80\x9d Strong stuff indeed, and it\xe2\x80\x99s good to see Cardiff fighting the good fight, because one\xe2\x80\x99s identity should always be held in the highest regard and treated with the utmost respect. Now, then, those red shirts \xe2\x80\xa6</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not murdered anyone, he\xe2\x80\x99s not a rapist or a paedophile. He\xe2\x80\x99s made a big mistake\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x98Arry Redknapp comes out in defence of Malky Mackay. O \xe2\x80\xa6 K \xe2\x80\xa6</p> A TRIP INTO THE \xe2\x80\x98FRIENDLY BANTER\xe2\x80\x99 ARCHIVES <p>October 2006: \xe2\x80\x9cRio Ferdinand appeared on Chris Moyles\xe2\x80\x99 show this morning and they entered into some friendly banter about which football player they would go out with. After Rio\xe2\x80\x99s comment, he immediately apologised\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 BBC blazers apologise after an incident in which Ferdinand responded to the DJ\xe2\x80\x99s question of whether he found Alan Smith or Paul Scholes more attractive, by saying: \xe2\x80\x9cThat is not my bag that, that is not my game, talking about going out with geezers \xe2\x80\xa6 You\xe2\x80\x99re a faggot.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> RECOMMENDED VIEWING <p>This week\xe2\x80\x99s Guardian Football Show: Nat Coombs investigates the behind-the-scenes workings of a transfer.</p>            A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel.

Is this a new development? Has the FA managed to renegotiate Mr Roy\xe2\x80\x99s contract, or has he simply signed up to the STOP FOOTBALL campaign? Either way, I am now filled with hope about the future performances of the England football team\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Vinnie Nambisan.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cForget Kick it Out, the LMA, and those hypothetical people who may have been offended by Malky Mackay\xe2\x80\x99s way of letting off steam, we need to know what the authority on banter thinks about all of this: how do I subscribe to Richard Keys\xe2\x80\x99 blog and when is the next post due?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 David Wall.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMay I complement you on your use of Twitter.

Nothing will ever shake that,\xe2\x80\x9d he roared.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Andrea Pirlo has delivered a blow to trampoline retailers on Merseyside. \xe2\x80\x9cMario [Balotelli] has matured since he has been back in Italy,\xe2\x80\x9d purred Pirlo. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will be the first to admit when he was younger he made some mistakes, but he is not that player any more.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>West Brom have signed bearded chest-beating occasional big-game goalscorer Georgios Samaras on a free transfer after he left the Queen\xe2\x80\x99s Celtic.</p> <p>And the Lib Dems reckon the way to sort out Britain is by bringing back terraces at top-flight matches. \xe2\x80\x9cThe big difference is that people would have an allocated area to stand in,\xe2\x80\x9d cheered MP John Leech.</p> STILL WANT MORE? <p>Jacob Steinberg and Daniel Harris have packed 4,340 words and 56 goals into this Joy of Six: high-scoring draws.
