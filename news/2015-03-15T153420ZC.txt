b'Chelsea v Southampton: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened | Michael Butler'


b'<p>Two dropped points as far as Chelsea are concerned, they will feel like they should have won here, but this draw means they are six points ahead of Manchester City, also with a game in hand. But let\xe2\x80\x99s all just give it up for Southampton, they were dangerous and incisive in the first half, and defended stoutly in the second. Forster, Fonte, Alderweireld, Schneiderlin and Mane were all outstanding. Southampton are sixth, ahead of Tottenham on goal difference. </p> <p>Speaking of Spurs, I\xe2\x80\x99m off to do the Manchester United v Tottenham MBM. Join me here, if you like. </p> <p>Ending on our managerial garments theme, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let Zach Neeley have the last word.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cCan you beat a fur coat?\xe2\x80\x9d, he emails.</p>     Crystal Palace manager Malcolm Allison, Photograph: Central Press/Getty Images    <p>No Zach, no you can\xe2\x80\x99t. Bye!</p>'
