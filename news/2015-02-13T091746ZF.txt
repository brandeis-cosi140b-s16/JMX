b'Football transfer rumours: Yacine Brahimi to Manchester City?'


b'<p>A magnificent dribbler and zippy left-winger who can also make himself at home in behind a striker but is occasionally prone to bouts of petulance, Porto\xe2\x80\x99s Yacine Brahimi is wanted by a host of English clubs including Tottenham Hotspur and Everton. Sadly for them, it is Manchester City who look likely to outbid any rivals by agreeing to pay the 25-year-old Algerian\xe2\x80\x99s release clause. According to the Express, the Premier League champions may sell Stevan Jovetic and Edin Dzeko to ensure that don\xe2\x80\x99t fall foul of financial fair play rules by bringing Brahimi to the Etihad. Jovetic could find a new home at Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid, while Dzeko \xe2\x80\x93 a peripheral figure at City this season \xe2\x80\x93 ought to have no shortage of admirers in the Premier League and abroad.</p> <p>Everton are also keen to sign Marseille\xe2\x80\x99s Ghanaian winger Andr\xc3\xa9 Ayew, but will face competition from Liverpool, Newcastle and Borussia Dortmund if they are to lure the 25-year-old to Goodison Park. With Ayew approaching the final months of his contract with the Ligue 1 side, reports on French radio earlier this week suggested his \xe2\x80\x9cpeople\xe2\x80\x9d are already in talks with Newcastle, who are trying to negotiate a pre-contract agreement with the player. In cracking form, he scored three goals in six games for Ghana when they were runners-up at the recent Africa Cup of Nations.</p> <p>James Milner is out of contract at Manchester City this summer and could be on his way to Arsenal or Liverpool unless he gets a guarantee of playing time from his current club, who would very much like to keep him. Liverpool and Arsenal are also keen on securing the services of Spanish striker \xc3\x81lvaro Morata, who is being lined up for a return to the Bernab\xc3\xa9u, despite being sold by Real Madrid for \xe2\x82\xac20m just last summer.</p> <p>Arguably the world\xe2\x80\x99s best midfield general, Paul Pogba has long been linked with a summer departure from Juventus and with Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea all circling, the Italian champions have identified Milan\xe2\x80\x99s Dutch enforcer Nigel de Jong as a possible replacement.</p> <p>Bolton academy graduate Josh Vela appears to have played his way back on to Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s wanted list during the fourth round FA Cup tie between the two sides, having previously featured on their radar as a 17-year-old, when the Championship side turned down a \xc2\xa31m offer from Anfield.</p> <p>And with Paul Lambert having left Villa Park, Aston Villa remain in the hunt for a new director of football operations and according to the Daily Mail and other media outlets, Tim Sherwood and J\xc3\xbcrgen Klinsmann are the leading contenders. Stuart James, our man on the Midlands beat, suspects Sherwood\xe2\x80\x99s position has been \xe2\x80\x9cseverely weakened\xe2\x80\x9d in the wake of his sidekick Chris Ramsey\xe2\x80\x99s decision to take the QPR job until the end of the season. Currently the head coach of the USA national team, Klinsmann has ruffled feathers in his adopted homeland with some withering criticism of the motivation of players such as Clint Dempsey and Michael Bradley, who returned from European domestic leagues to top up their pension funds playing MLS. He also caused something of a national scandal by omitting national treasure Landon Donovan from his squad for last summer\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup. Contracted to the USA until the end of the 2018 World Cup, Klinsmann is believed to have admirers in Villa\xe2\x80\x99s American owner Randy Lerner and his chief executive, Tom Fox, who hope to install a new boss at Villa Park before the visit of Stoke City next weekend.</p>'
