b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini criticised Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s display in the 1-1 draw with Roma that leaves them with only one point from their opening two Champions League games but vowed to win the remaining 12 available to qualify from Group E.</p> <p>Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero\xe2\x80\x99s early penalty was cancelled out by Francesco Totti\xe2\x80\x99s 24th-minute equaliser. While this goal made Roma\xe2\x80\x99s captain the competition\xe2\x80\x99s oldest scorer at 38 years and three days, Pellegrini conceded his side were not good enough to deserve the win in what was a sluggish, one-dimensional display.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think it was a very important game. A point playing at home is never good but also we play against a very strong team in a very good moment. It was not a surprise for me. They are a team in form with great players,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of a Roma side that have won all five of their Serie A matches this season as well as their opening Champions League match 5-1.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t play well, especially in the first half,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe started well in the first minutes. They made it difficult for us, it was a difficult game but I thought we could win it in the last 20 minutes. We improved in the second half but I think the draw was the [right] thing. We must continue fighting for the next points and see which team qualify for the next round.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>City\xe2\x80\x99s next two matches are home and away to CSKA Moscow, with the team having to take maximum points to retain any real hope. Asked how difficult it would now be to qualify from the group phase, Pellegrini said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know. It depends on the way we play the next game. We have just one point from six but also we are just three points behind Roma. We hope the next game in Russia we can win. We will see what happens against Bayern Munich. We have 12 more points to fight [for] and we will fight to the end to try to qualify.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Totti\xe2\x80\x99s goal came when an incisive break carved City\xe2\x80\x99s defence open to allow the Roma No10 to score. However, Pellegrini chose to criticise his team as a whole rather than focus on individuals.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the other team scores a goal it is not just a problem of one or two players,\xe2\x80\x9d the Chilean said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had too much space in that play.\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini also defended the decision to play two forwards, with Edin Dzeko partnering Ag\xc3\xbcero.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEvery time you don\xe2\x80\x99t reach the result you want of course there is a lot of different things to do. We play a lot of games against strong teams in this way and we do it very well,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, before criticising his team\xe2\x80\x99s ball retention. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe today we were not very accurate with our passing, so when we started losing too many balls we did not have enough midfielders to recover but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that was the reason. I think the most problem was we lost many easy passes.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>On a dismal night for City Paul Scholes, the former Manchester United midfielder who was at the tie as an ITV pundit, criticised the atmosphere. \xe2\x80\x9cThe crowd need to get behind this team. They need to create a special European atmosphere.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was lucky enough to play at Old Trafford and we always talked about the atmosphere on a Tuesday night, the special atmosphere you create, and the crowd is rocking when you go out for a warm-up.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAt quarter past seven and there\xe2\x80\x99s empty seats everywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of a crowd that numbered 37,509, well below the stadium\xe2\x80\x99s capacity. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you come here it just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a European night feel to it. You go to Liverpool, you go to Old Trafford, you go to Chelsea, they have a special feeling for it.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cTonight I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there is. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they realise what a big game this is. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got the team, they\xe2\x80\x99ve definitely got the players, the quality is definitely there, but do the crowd realise how lucky they are to be in this competition? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they do.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Scholes\xe2\x80\x99s former United team-mate, Rio Ferdinand, echoed this in two tweets. \xe2\x80\x9cHow many empty seats are there at the city vs Roma game by the way....big CL game &amp; fans would rather Ramsays Kitchen or something at home,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote in the first before adding. \xe2\x80\x9cExpanding the stadium [capacity] for what though?? For who though???\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Rudi Garc\xc3\xada, the Roma manager, brushed off the suggestion Kevin Strootman, his injured midfielder who will be available for December\xe2\x80\x99s return with City in Rome, might be sold. When it was put to him that Louis van Gaal, the United manager, was interested Garc\xc3\xada said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ll have to ask the [Roma] president but I think he\xe2\x80\x99s already answered it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Last week the president, James Pallotta, said: \xe2\x80\x9cKevin Strootman is not for sale and has never ever been discussed in that vein at Roma. We consider Kevin an integral highly-valued partner in our long-term plans.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
