b'Everton v Leicester City: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>There are some that are giving Everton\xe2\x80\x99s late leveller as a Matthew Upson own goal, but I\xe2\x80\x99m going to stick to my guns and say it was Lukaku\xe2\x80\x99s goal. Regardless of whether it\xe2\x80\x99s his name on the scoresheet, the Belgian was awful in front of goal and he should have had at least a hat-trick, as he did on Thursday in the Europa League. </p> <p>At the back Howard was equally poor, and between the Lukaku and their American goalkeeper, they are the main reason Everton didn\xe2\x80\x99t get the win today.</p> <p>Whilst they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the better chances, Leicester will see this as a huge opportunity missed. But that\xe2\x80\x99s what happens when you substitute Esteban Cambiasso. </p> <p>Thanks for all your emails and tweets. It\xe2\x80\x99s Southampton v Liverpool next up, which you can follow with Nick Ames here. Bye!</p>'
