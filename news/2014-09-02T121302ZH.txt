b'How transfer deadline day unfolded in the rest of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s big leagues'


b'<p>With everyone\xe2\x80\x99s attention on another record summer of spending by Premier League clubs, Monday was also transfer deadline day in the majority of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s domestic leagues.</p> <p>And while the majority of the continent\xe2\x80\x99s big-hitters had wrapped up their business much earlier, there were still plenty of last-minute deals that helped push the total spent by clubs in Spain, Italy, France and Germany past the \xc2\xa31bn mark.</p> <p>Here are some of the major moves:</p> Giacomo Bonaventura: Atalanta \xe2\x80\x93Milan \xe2\x82\xac7m <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s not been the greatest 2014 for the Rossoneri but after the arrivals of Fernando Torres  and the Dutch midfielder Marco van Ginkel on loan from Chelsea, edging out Internazionale for the 25-year-old midfielder should cheer them up slightly. Bonaventura had seemed likely to join Walter Mazzarri\xe2\x80\x99s Inter until Milan\xe2\x80\x99s deal for Jonathan Biabiany from Parma fell through, despite the Frenchman appearing in the famous red and black scarf on the club\xe2\x80\x99s Twitter feed. But when Cristian Zaccardo refused to go the other way, the manager Filippo Inzaghi acted quickly to snaffle a replacement.</p> <p>Total transfer window spend in Serie A: \xe2\x82\xac327m</p> Alessio Cerci: Torino \xe2\x80\x93 Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid \xe2\x82\xac16m <p>Having sold three of their team to Chelsea in the summer, the La Liga champions Atl\xc3\xa9tico were in desperate need of reinforcements. Diego Simeone failed in his attempts to lure the Brazil forward Douglas Costa from Shakhtar Donetsk having submitted a \xe2\x82\xac30m bid over the weekend but eventually got his man in the shape of the Italy winger Cerci on a three-year deal. The former Fiorentina and Roma man became the eighth player to move to the Vicente Calder\xc3\xb3n during the transfer window, joining Mario Mandzukic, Ra\xc3\xbal Jim\xc3\xa9nez and Antoine Griezmann in a new look attack.</p> <p>Total transfer window spend in La Liga: \xe2\x82\xac535m</p> D\xc3\xb3ria: Botafogo \xe2\x80\x93 Marseille \xe2\x82\xac10m <p>After a summer of excesses in 2013 that saw Monaco and Paris Saint-Germain spend more than a combined \xe2\x82\xac250m, there was a marked reversal this time round. The teenage Brazilian defender D\xc3\xb3ria was one of few big-money moves as he joined Marcelo Bielsa\xe2\x80\x99s revolution at Marseille after the purchase of the highly-rated Belgium striker Michy Batshuayi earlier. Elsewhere, Lille\xe2\x80\x99s capture of the Swiss striker Michael Frey from Young Boys Berne was the next biggest move as PSG\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to avoid further punishment over FFP meant manager Laurent Blanc had to make do with the \xe2\x82\xac50m paid to Chelsea for David Luiz.</p> <p>Total transfer window spend in Ligue 1: \xe2\x82\xac125m</p> Julian Green: Bayern Munich \xe2\x80\x93 Hamburg Loan <p>The closure of the Bundesliga\xe2\x80\x99s window at 6pm yesterday meant it was a relatively quiet day, with the Morocco defender Mehdi Benatia\xe2\x80\x99s move from Roma to Bayern for around \xe2\x82\xac30m before the weekend the last major deal to be completed. After almost being relegated last season, Hamburg were by far the busiest team as they ended Lewis Holtby\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League exile by signing the midfielder on a season-long loan and also snapped up the teenager Julian Green from Bayern. The 19-year-old already has three caps for the USA despite only appearing once for Pep Guardiola\xe2\x80\x99s side since joining as a youth team player.</p> <p>Total transfer window spend in Bundesliga: \xe2\x82\xac315m</p> Jos\xc3\xa9 Campa\xc3\xb1a: Sampdoria \xe2\x80\x93 Porto Loan <p>A year ago Campa\xc3\xb1a was hailed as a potential bargain when the former Spain Under-21 midfielder joined Crystal Palace from Sevilla for just \xe2\x82\xac2m. Six appearances later, he was shipped off to the Bundesliga side Nuremburg before returning to south London. Sampdoria took the plunge in the summer to take him to Serie A and having been an unused substitute in their opening game of the season against Palermo, Campa\xc3\xb1a now finds himself at Porto under his former Spain Under 21 coach Julen Lopetegui. Courted by Real Madrid as a teenager, it remains to be seen whether he will finally flourish although given the Portuguese league\xe2\x80\x99s habit of polishing players before selling them on at a huge profit, Campa\xc3\xb1a will probably be the subject of a Premier League bidding war this time next year.</p> <p>Total transfer window spend in Primeira Liga: \xe2\x82\xac87m</p>'
