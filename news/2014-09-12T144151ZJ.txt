b'Jack Grealish turning into the real deal as he keeps his options open'


b'<p>When Aston Villa wished Jack Grealish a happy 19th birthday on their club Twitter account on Wednesday, his response will have prompted frantic calls to the baker. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope yous got me a cake,\xe2\x80\x9d joked the youngster. Now in the final season of his contract and with Chelsea understood to be keen on securing his scrawl, the Solihull-born teenager\xe2\x80\x99s amusing nod to the Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 school of negotiation will have increased trepidation among Villa fans terrified their club may lose a stellar prospect.</p> <p>At international level, Grealish has also become the subject of a quietly simmering tug-of-love. Having represented the Republic of Ireland, for whom he qualifies through his grandparents, at all age groups from under-16 through to under-21, the Football Association has confirmed he is also on England\xe2\x80\x99s radar.</p> <p>For now, the lifelong Villa fan who joined the club as a six-year-old is content to keep his powder dry as he vies to become a first team staple under Paul Lambert. Behind the scenes both countries will continue their cautious attempts to seduce him, with each camp aware the consequences of coming on too strong could end with him falling into bed with the other.</p> <p>Grealish has made two substitute appearances in the Premier League this season and played the entirety of his side&apos;s Capital One Cup defeat by Leyton Orient. Following a loan spell during which five goals and seven assists in 38 appearances helped keep Notts County in League One last season, Lambert handed him his senior debut at Villa: a fleeting end-of-season cameo against Manchester City. It was an experience the player described as \xe2\x80\x9cthe best feeling of my life\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>A Jack-be-nimble who can play on either wing or behind the centre-forward in the No10 role, it is not just Grealish&apos;s boy-band quiff and penchant for wearing his socks at half-mast that make him easily identifiable. An almost supernatural ability to beat opponents has prompted much excitement among Villa fans who have had little to be enthused about during recent seasons of stagnation, relegation battles and behind-the-scenes turmoil.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI&apos;ll tell you who he reminds me of, John Robertson who played for Forest under Brian Clough,\xe2\x80\x9d says Bryan Jones, who recently retired as Villa&apos;s academy director. \xe2\x80\x9cJack\xe2\x80\x99s got similar qualities to him. He\xe2\x80\x99s not pacy by any stretch of the imagination but he has this ability to just ghost past people and you sit back and think \xe2\x80\x98How the bloody hell did he get round there?\xe2\x80\x99 It\xe2\x80\x99s a unique talent in this day and age. He&apos;s just one of those who drops his shoulder, an old fashioned wide player. He has the gift, something most players just haven&apos;t got: awareness, he sees passes other players don&apos;t see. He\xe2\x80\x99s a very good crosser of the ball and he can score goals with either foot if ever he decides to pull the trigger. That\xe2\x80\x99s one of his little weaknesses at the moment but I know the coaches are working on that. Potentially, I know he could be as good as he wants to be.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Harbouring initial reservations about sending such a whey-faced whelp to a struggling League One side to earn his spurs last season, Jones insisted on certain conditions. Grealish was put in digs with a landlady to \xe2\x80\x9clook after him and make sure he was fed right\xe2\x80\x9d and encouraged to complete his education.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNotts County were very good,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was just a little boy really but when he came back he\xe2\x80\x99d shot up physically, matured and he was a completely different character \xe2\x80\xa6 like a man. I think mixing with seniors in an adult changing room just changed him really in six or seven months. It was remarkable.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>With the Chelsea sharks circling, Grealish will soon be faced with a big decision: take their millions and risk becoming one of the club\xe2\x80\x99s army of out-of-sight out-of-mind \xe2\x80\x93 Chelsea have 26 players out on loan \xe2\x80\x93 or sign a less lucrative contract and advance his education in the Premier League with Villa. Both options have their obvious merits and talks between Villa and his father Kevin, who represents him, are continuing. \xe2\x80\x9cHe could be the most complete player we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever produced and that includes Gareth Barry, Steven Davis, Darius Vassell,\xe2\x80\x9d Jones says. \xe2\x80\x9cThis boy could be the biggest. Time will tell.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In Ireland, where Grealish recently had talks with the manager Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Neill but politely declined an invitation to spend time with the senior squad, it is hoped the Villa assistant coach Roy Keane will do his patriotic duty and convince his charge that his international future remains shrouded in green. Last week in Dublin, Keane joked that he could unwittingly scare him in the other direction.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think the Football Association of Ireland have done it right with Grealish,\xe2\x80\x9d says the former Irish international Kevin Kilbane, who was also courted by England as a teenager. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve had him capped at u16, u18 and u21 but he still seems to be inconclusive about where he\xe2\x80\x99s going to go. He&apos;s keeping his options open and maybe he&apos;s getting advice that it might be in his best interests to declare for England from a financial point of view and from a career point of view.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>With some amusement, Grealish has revealed that during a recent Premier League encounter, the Hull City and Ireland midfielder Stephen Quinn welcomed him to the field by hailing him as the \xe2\x80\x9cfake paddy\xe2\x80\x9d. It\xe2\x80\x99s true he\xe2\x80\x99s not as Irish as Guinness and coddle but in terms of talent it seems young Jack is very much the real deal.</p>'
