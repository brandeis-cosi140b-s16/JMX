b'Gordon Strachan has the wisdom and the luck to lead Scotland to second'


b'<p>Now for the real stuff. As Gordon Strachan will readily admit, the improvement in Scotland under his management is partly offset by only being visible in friendly matches and a World Cup qualification section that had degenerated into dead-rubber territory by the time of his appointment.</p> <p>On Sunday night in Dortmund, Scotland\xe2\x80\x99s latest bid to end a wait for a major finals appearance, which stretches back to 1998, begins and Germany, the world champions, will not provide a smooth European Championship start.</p> <p>With a couple of notable exceptions, Strachan has generally carried that useful commodity of luck in management. He may well have done so again on the international scene.</p> <p>Not only has the European Championship finals been expanded but the Scots find themselves in a group that offers promise. Germany will qualify, Gibraltar will make up the numbers and there are cases to be made for the three nations Scotland will challenge for second place \xe2\x80\x93 the Republic of Ireland, Georgia and Poland \xe2\x80\x93 carrying teams that have passed their best.</p> <p>By mid-November, Scotland will have faced those three nations and an assessment of their qualifying hopes will be more legitimate than after 90 minutes inside the Westfalenstadion. Recent campaigns have been ruined by poor starts.</p> <p>In the specific context of their German examination, Scotland\xe2\x80\x99s task has been made tougher by the absence through injury of Robert Snodgrass, who has been prominent in navy blue under Strachan. More galling is a glance at a weak defence, which is likely to come under serious pressure from a side looking to roar back from a midweek friendly defeat to Argentina. Germany were 4-0 down after 50 minutes before clawing back two goals.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a competitive game and the Germans come alive when it becomes competitive,\xe2\x80\x9d Strachan said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a wonderful game to watch from a neutral\xe2\x80\x99s point of view but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t take anything from it. When the Germans have to compete, they are a different animal.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>One team Strachan did take pointers from is Chile, who were widely considered as unfortunate to lose 1-0 to Germany in March. Chile played 3-4-3 that night, but it would come as a major surprise if Strachan were to match that bold system.</p> <p>There is cause for optimism even if this tie ends in expected defeat. Strachan\xe2\x80\x99s baby-steps with his squad have restored optimism to a Tartan Army who had become battle-weary after a series of blows and substandard performances from their team. Scotland have lost four of Strachan\xe2\x80\x99s 12 matches in charge with one of them, at Wembley against England, slightly harsh after a stirring performance from the visitors in a narrow 3-2 defeat.</p> <p>In Allan McGregor, Craig Gordon and David Marshall, Strachan has three goalkeepers who will be the envy of many international coaches \xe2\x80\x93 albeit only one of them can play at a time. The influence and composure of the captain, Darren Fletcher, has been restored to the dressing room and pitch while Steven Naismith\xe2\x80\x99s excellent start to the domestic season at Everton means Scotland have a potency of their own.</p> <p>Strachan is an unlikely hero. The idea of such elevated status, should he return Scotland to a major platform in France two years from now, does not sit all that comfortably with the man who won 50 caps. Yet players and supporters have clearly bought into the Strachan plan. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is an optimism around everybody; even at times when we haven\xe2\x80\x99t played well, we have still got results,\xe2\x80\x9d Naismith said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe have some momentum but all of that work has just been preparation for the big thing coming up. That\xe2\x80\x99s what we have to understand and believe. Everybody needs to work for the team. One of the first things the manager said was one of the best: \xe2\x80\x98Even if you are having a bad game, you have to work for your team-mates.\xe2\x80\x99</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThen he gives you the freedom, he lets you go and do your stuff. He knows that the players are good enough to do what they do without the worry of losing the ball. We have players who can see forward passes, see runs and score goals.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe are also so much more solid. That has got to be encouraging for us. In the past, we have done well in games and given as good as we got but left ourselves too open or not defended a set piece well enough, which has cost us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
