b'<p>Raheem Sterling could miss out on \xc2\xa33.38m in wages next season after Brendan Rodgers insisted the England international would stay at Liverpool even if he refuses to sign a new contract.</p> <p>The Liverpool manager has repeatedly stated Sterling will not be sold this summer having rejected a \xc2\xa3100,000-a-week, five-year contract. His stance hardened on Friday when he declared Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s owners, would keep the 20-year-old on his \xc2\xa335,000-a-week deal rather than sell to Manchester City or elsewhere should there be no agreement when contract talks resume at the end of the season.</p> <p>Liverpool began negotiations with Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s representative, Aidy Ward, at the time of October\xe2\x80\x99s win at Queens Park Rangers, the winger\xe2\x80\x99s former club and their opponents at Anfield on Saturday. Rejecting a \xc2\xa365,000-a-week pay rise has cost Sterling in excess of \xc2\xa31m so far (Liverpool did not offer \xc2\xa3100,000 a week from the outset) and he will miss out on \xc2\xa33.38m next season should the impasse continue until the summer of 2016. Sterling would then have only 12 months remaining on his contract and be in a stronger position to test Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s resolve over a transfer.</p> <p>Clarifying Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s position for the summer on Sterling, Rodgers said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve made our position clear from the beginning and the owners are very much supportive of that. Raheem won\xe2\x80\x99t be going anywhere this summer, even if there\xe2\x80\x99s not a deal agreed.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Sterling claimed in a BBC interview last month that his contract dispute was not about money but the ambition to achieve his career goals at the highest level. That line of argument remains valid with Liverpool likely to fall short in the race for Champions League qualification, as they did in the semi-finals of the FA Cup and Capital One Cup this season.</p> <p>Rodgers countered: \xe2\x80\x9cLook, everyone wants to win trophies, everyone wants to play in the big competitions; but it\xe2\x80\x99s also important that you have the opportunity to do that. We\xe2\x80\x99ll just be reinforcing our stance that\xe2\x80\x99s been in place all along \xe2\x80\x93 that this is the best club for him at this moment where he\xe2\x80\x99s got the opportunity to play and to fight and be competitive.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think he looks a lot more relaxed now than he has done for a while. He looks comfortable in himself again. We had a couple of good meetings. He came to my house and we had a good chat on a personal level as well. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just about the football side, it\xe2\x80\x99s also about his welfare because he\xe2\x80\x99s still young and he\xe2\x80\x99s been through a lot in the last couple of years.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Rodgers said it was not uncommon for him to invite a player to his home in an attempt to resolve any problems. \xe2\x80\x9cI do it with some when the moment\xe2\x80\x99s right. We had a good chat and it was about making himself comfortable as well. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just football; it\xe2\x80\x99s parenting as well, helping him and making sure everything is all right outside of his football.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Sterling\xe2\x80\x99s form has dipped markedly in recent weeks but Rodgers attributes that to the team\xe2\x80\x99s failings rather than a byproduct of the contract controversy.</p> <p>The manager said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re very much a team so when it functions it\xe2\x80\x99s set up for everyone to work well and play well. But the thing I love about Raheem is whether he\xe2\x80\x99s playing good, bad or indifferent he\xe2\x80\x99s on the training field every day, he works his socks off, he wants to learn and when he goes on to the field he gives everything.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Rodgers confirmed the club had held discussions over new contracts for Brad Jones and Kolo Tour\xc3\xa9, who are free agents this summer. He added Liverpool will have no qualms over providing Chelsea with a guard of honour at Stamford Bridge next Sunday should Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s team win the title on Sunday.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely we would,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis club is built on dignity, respect and class. So whoever is the champions and wherever it is that\xe2\x80\x99s what you do.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
