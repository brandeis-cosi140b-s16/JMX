b'Thibaut Courtois given all clear after release from hospital over head injury'


b'<p>The Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois has been discharged from hospital following the head injury he sustained against Arsenal on Sunday and has been cleared to play in Belgium\xe2\x80\x99s Euro 2016 qualifier on Thursday.</p> <p>Courtois was knocked flat after a 10th-minute collision with Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez in Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s 2-0 victory over Arsenal on Sunday but, after a brief examination by Chelsea staff, the Belgian continued in the home goal for a further 14 minutes. At that stage, when apparently bleeding from his right ear, he was substituted and taken to hospital for observation and \xe2\x80\x9cprecautionary tests\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>The club released a statement on Monday saying the 22-year-old had suffered \xe2\x80\x9ca minor cut to the ear\xe2\x80\x9d, making no mention of any suspected concussion, and that Courtois \xe2\x80\x9cis expected to report for international duty later this week\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>The goalkeeper also tweeted that he was feeling better and was looking forward to getting back onto the pitch.</p>    <p>Thanks for all the messages! I&#39;m already feeling better. Now I&#39;m resting to be recovered and back on the pitch soon. Great victory yesterday</p>&mdash; Thibaut Courtois (@thibautcourtois) October 6, 2014    <p>Headway, the brain injury charity, has questioned the application of the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s regulations following the decision to allow Courtois to play on. The Premier League is understood to be happy the rules were correctly applied.</p> <p>But Headway\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive, Peter McCabe, said on the charity\xe2\x80\x99s website: \xe2\x80\x9cThe new rules introduced this season were designed to ensure no risks to players\xe2\x80\x99 health were taken. They clearly state that \xe2\x80\x98If there is any suspicion of the player having sustained a concussion, they must be removed from the field of play, and not allowed to return.\xe2\x80\x99</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis incident calls into question whether these rules are working effectively. It is hard to understand how a concussion was not suspected following the sickening clash.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>McCabe acknowledged the difficulty of making an assessment from television, but questioned why a \xe2\x80\x9csafety-first approach\xe2\x80\x9d was not applied. He added: \xe2\x80\x9cBleeding from one or both ears is one of the symptoms to look out for that requires an immediate visit or return to hospital following a head injury.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that the bleeding only became apparent 15 minutes after the injury also demonstrates the evolving nature of concussion and highlights why a safety-first approach must be taken with all head injuries.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In the wake of the widespread criticism attracted by Tottenham Hotspur and their then manager, Andr\xc3\xa9 Villas-Boas, for allowing the goalkeeper Hugo Lloris to continue against Everton when concussed last November, the FA introduced new rules on dealing with head injuries at the start of the season which state that in the likelihood of concussion players should be taken off immediately.</p> <p>As a result, the Chelsea manager, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho, fielded a number of questions on the issue after the match but defended the actions of the club\xe2\x80\x99s medical staff while Courtois was given the all clear on Sunday night.</p> <p>The Belgium coach, Marc Wilmots, had been expected to rest Courtois against Andorra in light of the injury although Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s statement leaves open the possibility that the 22-year-old could still feature on Thursday and then against Bosnia-Herzegovina next Monday.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cCourtois had a mild concussion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wilmots. \xe2\x80\x9cHe will have another late test in London tomorrow (Tuesday) but we hope he can play against Andorra.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
