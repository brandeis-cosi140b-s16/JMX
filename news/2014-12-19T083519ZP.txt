b'Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend'


b'1) The answer to Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s problems could be under their nose <p>Mamadou Sakho has all the defensive qualities that Liverpool need: he is strong in the tackle, excellent in the air, diligent, disciplined and a tidy user of the ball. True, at times he also looks perilously close to dropping a significant clanger but that could be said of any Liverpool defender and, in fairness, even allowing for the injury that hampered him for a while, it is slightly mysterious that he has not made a single Premier League start since the home defeat to Aston Villa on 13 September. Dejan Lovren\xe2\x80\x99s groin trouble could mean the Frenchman returns to the starting line-up on Sunday, and Liverpool could be all the more solid for that.

Manchester United play Aston Villa, Manchester United beat Aston Villa, home or away. The men from Old Trafford have won their last seven league games against them, a run that started in February 2011, and have clocked up a goal difference of plus 17 in the meantime. These have not just been standard, occasionally close-fought wins. There have been a lot of thrashings. Even last season, as United were wilting fast, and \xe2\x80\x98Moyes out\xe2\x80\x99 banners were flying over Old Trafford, they beat Villa 7-1 over both league games. As Moyes was being hauled into the chief executive\xe2\x80\x99s office in April, he must have pointed out they had recently beaten Villa 4-1. That was clearly not sufficient. The last point Villa picked up against them was in November 2010, in a home 2-2 draw, and it is five years since Villa beat United, 1-0 at Old Trafford.</p> <p>It is just Villa\xe2\x80\x99s luck that they should run into their nemesis just when Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s side are in their best form of the season. But Villa have been on an encouraging run too, of only one defeat in six games, although less encouragingly, it came against West Bromwich last weekend. CL</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Lambert plays down Roy Keane\xe2\x80\x99s doorstepping of Tom Cleverley\xe2\x80\xa2 The forgotten story of \xe2\x80\xa6 the life and death of Tommy Ball\xe2\x80\xa2 Falcao keen to stay but uncertain over Manchester United future\xe2\x80\xa2 Herrera denies any involvement in match-fixing</p>  3) Strikerless side v strikerless side could lead to magic      Pos Team P GD Pts      1 Chelsea 16 23 39    2 Man City 16 19 36    3 Man Utd 16 12 31    4 West Ham 16 8 28    5 Southampton 16 12 26       <p>When Tony Pulis walked out of Selhurst Park on the eve of the new season, few observers would have expected Crystal Palace to head to the Etihad just before Christmas with similar striking options to Manchester City - and yet here the two clubs are, coming together for an important meeting with nary a striker between them. Well, Palace do have Dwight Gayle but Neil Warnock does not appear to have much faith in him, complaining that the centre-forward does not impress enough in training and did not do enough after coming on for the last 15 minutes of last week\xe2\x80\x99s bleak draw. Still, hamstring problems for Marouane Chamakh \xe2\x80\x93 a lovely player outside the box, but too seldom inside it \xe2\x80\x93 means Gayle could start against City, who might even be envious. Because injuries to Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic mean Manuel Pellegrini has an interesting puzzle to solve. If the manager wanted to stick to his usual system he could deploy the 18-year-old Jose \xc3\x81ngel Pozo in a lone forward role, but it seems more likely that he will try for a fluid 4-6-0 scheme. That could pave the way for lots of clever flitting and darting involving Samir Nasri, David Silva, Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 and whoever else Pellegrini picks. Get it right and it could be a delight, except for the Palace defenders obviously.

The young goalkeeper has conceded eight goals in two appearances since injury cast him into the fold and he hurt his shoulder in the defeat at Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, briefly leading to suggestions that Newcastle would have to draft in a replacement keeper on loan. It turns out that Alnwick is not as badly injured as first feared and will start against Sunderland, giving him the perfect opportunity to prove his worth \xe2\x80\x93 or setting him up for an even bigger fall. The young man will be under intense pressure on Sunday and Sunderland will certainly seek to test his nerve. PD</p>  <li> Police take new approach to Newcastle v Sunderland after MH17 tragedy</li>  5) Absences make Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s midfield heart grow softer <p>This was always going to be a complicated period for Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s squad but Ronald Koeman could have done without his own players making it worse. If the Dutchman was uncharacteristically ruffled after his team\xe2\x80\x99s Capital One Cup defeat at Sheffield on Tuesday, it was not merely because of the so-called disrespect shown by the people in the other dugout: it was probably also due to the fact that the bookings for Morgan Schneiderlin and Victor Wanyama mean Southampton will be deprived of their first-choice central midfielders for the visit of Everton. With Jack Cork out injured, Koeman will likely have to assign Steven Davies a deeper role than usual \xe2\x80\x93 if, that is, the Northern Irishman is fit in time. Otherwise he may have to move Toby Alderweireld up from central defence, meaning Maya Yoshida will have to partner Jos\xc3\xa9 Fonte (Florin Gardos not being an option following his red card on Tuesday). By contrast, Everton are suddenly looking much stronger in the middle, with Ross Barkley and Muhamed Besic becoming so dangerous and dynamic at the base of their midfield that Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez might not even have to hurry James McCarthy back from injury. Southampton have been in a rut recently \xe2\x80\x93 five losses in a row is their worst run in a decade \xe2\x80\x93 and getting out of it this weekend will be tough.

Alan Irvine\xe2\x80\x99s team tend to be exceedingly defensive on their travels so will probably set out to frustrate Rangers in the hope that agitation, or even sheer boredom, will infect the home players and crowd. But Rangers have developed sharpness and real verve at Loftus Road in recent weeks and, with Charlie Austin set to return, can be confident of recording a third home win in a row over relegation rivals. If they are to ultimately avoid relegation, chances are they will also need to beat teams such as the Baggies away \xe2\x80\x93 and they will have the opportunity to do that, since part of the reason for their awful record on the road so far is that all eight matches have been against teams in the top 10 (and their next one is at Arsenal). QPR\xe2\x80\x99s away results could improve in the second half of the season but for now they need to keep making fellow strugglers feel unwelcome at Loftus Road. PD</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Why have QPR not won a single point from eight away matches this season?\xe2\x80\xa2 Gardner backs Irvine after West Brom sink Aston Villa</p>  7) Could Bojan be key to unlocking Chelsea?   <div data-embed-type="table" class="player-card player-card--football" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <div class="player-card__image-container">  </div> <div class="player-card__player"> <div class="player-card__position" itemprop="jobTitle">Striker</div> <div class="player-card__name" itemprop="name">Krkic Bojan</div> </div> <dl class="player-card__stats"> <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Appearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">11</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Free Kicks</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">11</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Corners</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">6</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Crosses</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">33</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Assists</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">1</dd> </dl> </div>   <p>Stoke beat Arsenal in their last home game but cannot expect to find Chelsea as vulnerable as Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s team were. Instead Mark Hughes is likely to try to use the counter-attacking template that enabled his side to snatch victory at Manchester City this season but, with Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas returning to Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s starting line-up, this will be a stiffer challenge. The form of Bojan Krkic is the major source of hope for the home side: Bojan did not feature at the Etihad because he had yet to find his feet in English football, but he has been brilliantly inventive in recent weeks and is expected to be fit to face Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s team, who, nonetheless, should prevail. PD</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Stamford Bridge \xe2\x80\x93 then and now</p> 8) Ings and Barnes can give Spurs pause for thought <p>A couple of month ago this would have seemed like the ideal fixture to help Tottenham round off a week that has seen them win at Swansea and trounce Newcastle. But Burnley are now looking a sterner proposition and could frustrate Spurs the way that Crystal Palace did at White Hart Lane two weeks ago \xe2\x80\x93 but with added penetration up front thanks to the burgeoning partnership between Danny Ings and Ashley Barnes. After Marvin Sordell and Lukas Jutkiewicz failed to flourish, Barnes was given his chance six games ago to stake his claim to serve as Ings\xe2\x80\x99 sidekick and Burnley have taken 11 points in those games, with Barnes scoring winning goals against Hull and Southampton.

They have not won any of their last 11 matches but nor have they been beaten particularly badly in any of them. There is no gulf between them and the other teams, yet lose against Leicester and the gap between them and everyone else could grow wider. West Ham can expect a competitive encounter but, with the renaissance of Stewart Downing and Andy Carroll continuing, West Ham look likely to extend their big for a top four spot.

Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images    10) Time is ripe for a Swansea win <p>A little over 10 years ago, Hull v Swansea was a League Two fixture (Hull won home and away in the 2003-04 season). By 2010-11 they were playing each other in the Championship (a draw and a Hull win) and then last season they faced each other in the top division for the first time (again, Hull came away with four points). So, the time is ripe for Swansea to beat the Tigers, and if they can recapture the sort of display that beat Arsenal early last month, then they will. Jefferson Montero and Wilfried Bony are a dream combination of, respectively, speed on the wing and power and accuracy in front of goal. It is just their awkward habit of conceding late, decisive goals that has undone the Swans this season. Last Sunday, against Tottenham, was a case in point.</p> <p>Hull have gone nine games without a win \xe2\x80\x93 a run that started promisingly with draws at Arsenal and Liverpool but has only worsened since then \xe2\x80\x93 and Steve Bruce, their manager, will miss Tom Huddlestone, after his red card against Chelsea last weekend. What can he do to get his team out of their current funk? If his players can pull themselves together, there is a chance they could escape the relegation zone before the FA Cup third round. The fixture computer was clearly feeling generous towards Hull in the summer, as it produced Christmas games against Sunderland, Leicester and Everton.
