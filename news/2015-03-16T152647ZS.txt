b'Salomon Kalou in hot water after appearing to damage Berlin Wall'


b'<p>The former Chelsea forward Salomon Kalou may be facing a hefty fine after appearing to deface the Berlin Wall with a hammer and chisel during a television news report.</p> <p>The 29-year-old Kalou, who plays for Hertha Berlin, was attempting to compare breaking off a piece of the wall with his intentions to break down the Schalke defence.</p> <p>The wall, which divided Berlin between 1961 and 1989, is a protected monument, dating back to the fall of the German Democratic Party in 1991, and anyone found guilty of defacing it could face a fine of up to \xe2\x82\xac10,000 (\xc2\xa37,145).</p> <p>Authorities in Berlin are reportedly set to inspect whether any damage was done following a complaint from Kani Alavi, the chairman of the Eastside Gallery, which owns the copyright to the graffiti on the wall.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI nearly fell off the sofa when I saw the footage,\xe2\x80\x9d Alavi told the Berliner Kurier newspaper. \xe2\x80\x9cHere we have a well-paid celebrity increasing his market value at the expense of a national monument. Without respect. And with the clear backing of television.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cJust because there is no security patrolling the Gallery, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean you can go around doing what you want. If he had done that at the Brandenburg Gate, the player would probably have been arrested.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Hertha Berlin and Schalke drew 2-2 on Saturday but Kalou was unable to find the net.</p>'
