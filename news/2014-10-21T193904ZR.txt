b'<p>When the Spanish journalists had finally stopped asking him about the injury situation for the cl\xc3\xa1sico on Saturday \xe2\x80\x93 Gareth Bale will not be back in time \xe2\x80\x93 Real Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s manager Carlo Ancelotti said it was \xe2\x80\x9ca great honour\xe2\x80\x9d to come to Liverpool as only the second individual after Bob Paisley to win three European Cups.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe was a fantastic manager and to be sitting here in the stadium is a great honour for me,\xe2\x80\x9d Ancelotti said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe atmosphere at this ground is always a little bit special, and the European history is exceptional. I think you will see a spectacular explosion of football on Wednesday night, everything that is good about the game. I find it incredible that I am being asked about injuries ahead of Saturday when we are here to focus on a game against Liverpool.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ancelotti, twice a European Cup winner with Milan and now with Real Madrid, paid tribute to the incredible form of Cristiano Ronaldo, a player he recently described as the best he has ever worked with. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s in a really good moment right now, incredibly focused, and I think it might be impossible for him to do any better,\xe2\x80\x9d the Real Madrid manager said.</p> <p>Alvaro Arbeloa, returning to Liverpool after playing for several seasons under Rafa Ben\xc3\xadtez, joined in the admiration. \xe2\x80\x9cThe form Cristiano is currently showing is incredible,\xe2\x80\x9d the defender said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe records he is setting in Spain at the moment take some believing. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he is in the best form of his career, other people may be better placed to judge, but confidence-wise I\xe2\x80\x99d say he is the highest he could be right now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ronaldo, too, has experience of playing at Anfield, albeit as a visitor, and he has been telling his Real Madrid team-mates to expect an intimidating atmosphere. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been telling them the same thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Arbeloa said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Cristiano has mentioned he always found this the most difficult away ground from his time in the Premier League.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMany things have changed from the last times the teams met [March 2009], both clubs have brought in new players, but I think the Anfield atmosphere on a European night will always be the same.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEven league matches have a special atmosphere here. It is difficult to explain, you just have to experience it. Every player should try it at least once in his career. People are telling me Liverpool did not play all that well at the weekend, but believe me if they had lost 10-0 at QPR I would still be worried about coming here for a European night. We are expecting a tough game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
