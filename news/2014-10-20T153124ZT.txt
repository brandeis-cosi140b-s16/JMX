b'BUSINESS-LIKE UP FRONT, A SHAMBLES AT THE BACK <p>With exciting midweek Big Cup action to come in the wake of a crazy weekend itinerary that featured an 8-0 shellacking, no shortage of comedy own goals, managerial rants about overweight Moroccans and the injustice of referees, the Fiver could do with a night off from the football. But rather than curling up on the sofa to watch our Aston Villa\xe2\x80\x99s Goals From Their Last Four Matches DVD, our attention will turn to the Hawthorns, where West Brom\xe2\x80\x99s match against Manchester United will need to be a real humdinger if it is to eclipse Gary Neville and Jamie Carragher\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s defensive shortcomings in this evening\xe2\x80\x99s Sky Sports Monday Night Football entertainment stakes.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no teams who are easy to beat \xe2\x80\x93 that is the big difference between England and other leagues,\xe2\x80\x9d said Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal, who the Fiver will charitably presume was talking prior to Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s events in Southampton. A win tonight would catapult United to the dizzy heights of fourth in the league, but with just four points separating them from Newcastle in the relegation zone a heavy defeat would plunge them into the bottom half of the table, prompting premature talk of a crisis. With nobody seeming quite sure yet whether or not West Brom are any good, only time will tell if they have enough about them to inflict a defeat of any kind on Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s United. In the buildup to the game, Alan Irvine has been nothing if not respectful.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey are still Manchester United and have some great players,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, upon being asked if he fancied his side\xe2\x80\x99s chances against a team that, like Chris Waddle\xe2\x80\x99s famous mullet, looks pretty business-like up front but remains a bit of a shambles at the back. With matches against Chelsea and Manchester City ahoy, United fans will be hoping they can extract maximum points from what could prove a tricky Monday night fixture that has wreaked absolute havoc with midfielder Juan Mata\xe2\x80\x99s blog-writing duties.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe day before a game I like to sleep a lot so I don\xe2\x80\x99t go to bed very late,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote in One Hour Behind from the team coach as it made its way to the Black Country. \xe2\x80\x9cToday I\xe2\x80\x99m writing this earlier than usual, because normally I work on the blog after dinner, when all the games are finished. But to me it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to feel rested during the most important moment of the week.\xe2\x80\x9d Of course considering Mata\xe2\x80\x99s nationality, his idea of an early night could be 4am, not too long after finishing the meal he sat down to eat at the traditional Spanish dinner time of two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. Hopefully, he is well rested. The Fiver suspects any complaints about fatigue lodged with Mata\xe2\x80\x99s decidedly volatile boss would not be met with sympathy similar to that of a certain England manager.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Follow West Brom 3-5 Manchester United with Simon Burnton\xe2\x80\x99s minute-by-minute report.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY  <p>11am \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m definitely not walking away, no chance. This is a big club, I love working for it and I am proud to be the manager. There have been a lot of tough days and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t put up with that for over two years just to walk away. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to come out fighting for myself because there\xe2\x80\x99s no one else doing that at the moment. I\xe2\x80\x99m not after a kiss and a cuddle \xe2\x80\x93 maybe from the missus \xe2\x80\x93 and supporters are within their rights to boo but it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to boo when you lose\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Lee Clark says he will not walk away from Birmingham City.</p> <p>2.15pm \xe2\x80\x9cThe search for a successor has already begun and the board will look to make an appointment in the very near future\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Birmingham City make it clear he can head home for that cuddle after all.</p>     Lee Clark prepares for that cuddle.

Taarabt is not injured. He\xe2\x80\x99s not fit. He\xe2\x80\x99s not fit to play football unfortunately. He played in a reserve game the other day and I could have run about more than he did. I can\xe2\x80\x99t pick him. What am I supposed to keep saying? Keep getting your \xc2\xa360,000, \xc2\xa370,000 a week and don\xe2\x80\x99t train?

Friday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver, I read the first line, \xe2\x80\x98Unlike the player himself, this Raheem Sterling story just runs and runs\xe2\x80\x99, laughed a proper out loud laugh, thought \xe2\x80\x98f*ck it, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to top that is it\xe2\x80\x99, and closed the email. Was the brilliance of the opening line just a fluke (the proverbial monkey who managed to type the collected works of Shakespeare) or a cunning ploy to hide the fact that the rest of the fiver was filled out by somebody just holding down the zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz key before knocking off even earlier than usual and heading for the pub?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Andrew Beveridge.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cA friend just sent me this \xe2\x80\x93 I don\xe2\x80\x99t where it came from, but it made me laugh\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Jonathan Foulkes.</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
