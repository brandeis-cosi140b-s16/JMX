b'Arsenal FA Cup semi-final overshadowed, says Reading\xe2\x80\x99s Steve Clarke'


b'<p>The Reading manager, Steve Clarke, has suggested football authorities are not doing enough to protect the status of the FA Cup and are diluting its appeal by allowing his team\xe2\x80\x99s semi-final with Arsenal to clash with the televised Premier League match between Chelsea and Manchester United.</p> <p>Reading\xe2\x80\x99s first FA Cup semi-final appearance for 88 years kicks off at Wembley at 5.20pm on Saturday, 10 minutes before the start of the match between United and Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Clarke criticised the scheduling and with Reading having been forced to play last month\xe2\x80\x99s sixth-round replay against Bradford City on a Monday evening a mere two days after a Championship match at Watford, the manager thinks the FA Cup is not being treated as the world\xe2\x80\x99s oldest knockout competition that he believes it to be.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was a shame in the last round when we had to play on a Monday night after playing on a Saturday,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarke said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are things that we should do to protect this great competition. It should be special.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Clarke also wondered about the logic of holding the FA Cup final more than three weeks after the end of the regular Championship season, meaning that if his team spring a shock against Arsenal they will face a lengthy spell without competitive action before a final against Liverpool or Aston Villa, whose league campaigns end a week after Reading\xe2\x80\x99s.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we beat Arsenal we have to wait four weeks after our last league game to play the cup final. This is also not correct,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clarke, who quipped that his use of \xe2\x80\x9cwhen\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cnot a slip of the tongue\xe2\x80\x9d. He was serious when he said that having to wait so long for the final would pose a challenges as to how to keep his players match-sharp.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI probably need to go on holiday for two [weeks] and then bring the team back in,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a long break. If we get to the final, what are we going to do from 2 May to 24 May? What do we do? Everyone else has played, so we won\xe2\x80\x99t be playing games. It\xe2\x80\x99d be a great puzzle to have though.</p> <p>While Clarke lamented the fact neutral TV viewers will have to choose between watching Reading take on Arsenal or Chelsea entertain Manchester United, he is happy fans of his own club will get to see something that most of them have never witnessed. The team\xe2\x80\x99s last appearance at this stage of the competition dates back to 1927, when they lost 3-0 to Cardiff City, who famously went on to beat Arsenal in the final.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere will be 31,000 Reading fans at the stadium and any Reading fan who has not got a ticket will be watching Reading on television,\xe2\x80\x9d Clarke said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only game I\xe2\x80\x99m interested in is Reading v Arsenal.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
