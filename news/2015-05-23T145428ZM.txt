b'<p>If Louis van Gaal turns out to be mistaken and David de Gea does accept Real Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to ease out Iker Casillas, the goalkeeper they called San Iker in happier times at the Bernab\xc3\xa9u, presumably the outstanding performer of Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s season will know in advance that it might be a more complicated business than many people realise.</p> <p>It isn\xe2\x80\x99t easy anywhere, let alone somewhere with Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s record of politics and infighting, when a new kid on the block is ushered in to replace someone who has become an institution at their club in the way Casillas has for the 10-time European Cup holders.</p>  <p> Related: Premier League fans\xe2\x80\x99 verdicts part 1: Arsenal to Manchester City </p>   <p>When Larry Lloyd joined Liverpool from Bristol Rovers in 1969 it was because Bill Shankly wanted someone who could eventually take over from Ron Yeats, the club\xe2\x80\x99s distinguished centre-half and captain, and the new signing arrived at Anfield to find Yeats\xe2\x80\x99s wife waiting for him. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me tell you something, young man,\xe2\x80\x9d she told Lloyd. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have no chance, you are simply not in his class.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As for the goalkeepers\xe2\x80\x99 union, that tight little community who apparently always look after their own, David James could barely look at Brad Friedel when the American was recruited by Liverpool in 1997 to challenge for his place. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I could think was: \xe2\x80\x98Who the effing hell are you?\xe2\x80\x99 and: \xe2\x80\x98Where\xe2\x80\x99s your work permit?\xe2\x80\x99 I was asking all these questions about whether he\xe2\x80\x99d played enough games for America because I wanted them to send him home.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>When Friedel made his debut, James was desperate for it to go horribly wrong \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cevery time the ball went near him I was thinking: \xe2\x80\x98Go on, drop it.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 and if that sounds remarkably self\xe2\x80\x91centred it is far from the only story of this kind in the goalkeeping fraternity. At PSV Eindhoven, Ronald Waterreus used to switch on the television at all sorts of unspeakable hours to make sure his room-mate and fellow shot-stopper Georg Koch did not get a decent night\xe2\x80\x99s sleep before matches.</p> <p>Casillas might be a lot more welcoming to a fellow Madridista. Then again, he might not. He took it as a personal affront the last time he was removed from the team and, whether it is true or not that he was the instigator of all those corrosive dressing-room leaks, the memory still lingers of Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s first day back at Chelsea and his change in body language when I asked him about the consequences and rancour of favouring Diego L\xc3\xb3pez. Mourinho gave the impression that if he saw Casillas drowning in the Manzanares, 20 feet out, he would make sure to throw him a 15-foot rope.</p> <p>It certainly wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be straightforward for De Gea, who should also be aware that he could wear Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s colours with distinction over the next decade and still find himself jeered if he dares to misjudge a cross later in his career. Casillas can tell him all about that after some of the treatment he has encountered over the past few months, whereas Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale might also testify about the way the Bernab\xc3\xa9u crowd can be high on disdain and low on gratitude. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not a sane mentality,\xe2\x80\x9d Rinus Michels once said of Barcelona. Yet no club is more impulsive, more impatient and more prone to the pa\xc3\xb1olada, the mutinous waving of white hankies, than their great rivals.</p> <p>That\xe2\x80\x99s the downside. The alternative argument is that Madrid is still the place in football where most of the sport\xe2\x80\x99s dreamers believe they can turn into dream-makers. It is obvious why the club\xe2\x80\x99s president, Florentino P\xc3\xa9rez, is attracted to De Gea (nothing will convince me De Gea wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have saved the shot from \xc3\x81lvaro Morata that got the hankies fluttering again and eliminated Madrid from the Champions League) and the unfortunate truth for United is that it would still be a shock if Van Gaal is correct and De Gea chooses to bat away Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s advances.</p> <p>Plainly, the alternative would be a considerable setback for Van Gaal given the consistently upward trajectory of De Gea\xe2\x80\x99s career since those early days in Manchester when he could be a danger to his own team and Eric Steele, then United\xe2\x80\x99s goalkeeping coach, talked of him being a poor trainer, \xe2\x80\x9clazy\xe2\x80\x9d when it came to learning English, and eating \xe2\x80\x9ctoo many tacos\xe2\x80\x9d. De Gea\xe2\x80\x99s raw potential was always obvious but there is no point trying to airbrush out of history how vulnerable he was back then. Steele remembers that first six months as \xe2\x80\x9chorrendous\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>His improvement since then has been phenomenal and the question for United now has to be whether there are contingency plans to make sure the process of replacing him would be as seamless as possible. Petr Cech has been mentioned as a possible replacement and it was intriguing to discover United\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive, Ed Woodward, met Mourinho at a hotel in London on Friday (though the relevant people assure me it was purely a case of bumping into one another). Tottenham Hotspur have a long history of taking United\xe2\x80\x99s money that means their supporters should feel slightly uneasy about the potential availability of Hugo Lloris. Yet, equally, let\xe2\x80\x99s not disregard that there is also Victor Vald\xc3\xa9s, one of the mainstays of Pep Guardiola\xe2\x80\x99s great Barcelona sides, in reserve at Old Trafford. Vald\xc3\xa9s might not be a long-term solution at the age of 33 but he has won the Ricardo Zamora trophy as the best goalkeeper in La Liga more times than anyone else and the answer might be staring United in the face if his year recovering from a knee injury has not dulled his reflexes.</p>  <p> Related: Real Madrid 7-3 Getafe | La Liga match report </p>   <p>There are certainly enough options to make a reasonable argument that United\xe2\x80\x99s more glaring issue this summer will not theoretically be replacing De Gea but planning for the other end of the pitch and how to compensate for the fact that all three of their main strikers are, to varying degrees, on the wane.</p> <p>Those of us who imagined Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s appointment might re-invigorate Robin van Persie now have to accept he will probably never be the player who bewitched Old Trafford in his first season at the club. Radamel Falcao ought to be grateful he has been spared the league\xe2\x80\x99s wooden-spoon awards because of Mario Balotelli\xe2\x80\x99s risible efforts at Liverpool and let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget that Wayne Rooney is approaching the point of his professional life when age slowly becomes the footballer\xe2\x80\x99s hardest opponent. He is 30 in October and his body shape has always made United suspect he might have to re-invent himself as a midfielder once he is on the way down.</p> <p>It was David Moyes who identified the lack of dynamism in United\xe2\x80\x99s attack and set about exploring whether Edinson Cavani might be the answer. Falcao was supposed to bring his own stardust but United have not scored any more freely this season than under Moyes, currently two short of last year\xe2\x80\x99s total of 64, and the presence of so many high-reputation strikers seems to have disguised a revealing truth since Sir Alex Ferguson ushered himself into retirement with a 5-5 draw at West Brom two years ago. Manchester City have amassed 183 league goals since then. Liverpool have 152, Arsenal 135 and Chelsea, the boring so-and-sos, 141. United have managed 126.</p> <p>Memphis Depay might help to make up the shortfall but there is still some way to go bearing in mind that in Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s last eight years the team averaged 80 league goals per season. It is now around the low-60s and, unfortunately for Falcao, the chances of United completing the \xc2\xa343.2m deal to sign him from Monaco beyond the current loan arrangement are somewhere between non-existent and miniscule.</p>  <p> Related: Premier League fans\xe2\x80\x99 verdicts part 2: Manchester United to West Ham </p>   <p>Falcao\xe2\x80\x99s decline has been so difficult on the eye that he is now attracting the one thing no footballer ever wants \xe2\x80\x93 pity \xe2\x80\x93 and there are people at Old Trafford who have started talking about his inadequacies in a way that reminds me of how Alvy Singer, Woody Allen\xe2\x80\x99s character, used to excuse Annie Hall\xe2\x80\x99s erratic parking. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s OK,\xe2\x80\x9d Alvy said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can walk to the kerb from here.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>De Gea is a different matter entirely and it would be intriguing to know exactly why Van Gaal believes the Spaniard will opt to remain in Manchester when the lesson of history is that Madrid generally get what they want. He is not, however, as irreplaceable as some people appear to believe. For United, the greater issue might actually be returning to the days when it would have felt implausible that their best player was their goalkeeper.</p> The conspiracy of poppycock  <p>Better late than never, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has finally accepted it was disingenuous to allege there was a campaign among the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s higher authorities to nobble Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s title challenge through the kind of refereeing mistakes that invariably happen to every club over the course of the season.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe \xe2\x80\x98campaign\xe2\x80\x99 is not a nice word,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe I would take that word out from my explanation and my comments, but that [bad decisions] is the reality. We had very bad decisions over a big period of time. But I also made bad decisions, no problem.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>By Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s standards, that is straying dangerously close to a climbdown but what a pity he had to wait until now before accepting he was wrong. It was five months ago when he first made that complaint and the timing of his latest comments, just as Chelsea are preparing to be reunited with the championship trophy, merely firms up the suspicion that it was always a deliberate ploy to put pressure on referees and \xe2\x80\x9cget an advantage\xe2\x80\x9d, to use the description of Manuel Pellegrini at Manchester City.</p> <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s an old trick and Mourinho won\xe2\x80\x99t be the last to use it but he has gone further than anyone else when it comes to pushing it to the next level. It rubs a bit thin, therefore, that he should withdraw the allegation now everything is done, and we can only cling to the faint hope he tries to behave with a little more decorum next season (fat chance, I know).</p> <p>At other times, Mourinho has lumped in the media and in particular Sky\xe2\x80\x99s television pundits as further evidence that there is a concerted conspiracy against his club. It was poppycock and he knew it all along.</p> Dead man walking  <p>Sam Allardyce has been a good manager and sometimes a very good manager even if not quite as good as he appears to believe. He has certainly done more good than bad for West Ham United but it has been obvious for a long time that the club have lost faith in him and merely been waiting for his contract to run down so they could ease him off the premises, free of compensation. West Ham have duly gone from a side that took 31 points from their first 17 matches to one that has been in relegation form since Christmas with 16 points from the following 20 games. That is almost certain to finish with the guillotine coming down on Allardyce\xe2\x80\x99s reign on Monday but, in fairness to him, is it any wonder his players have lost their focus when they have known for months, like everyone else, that he was a dead man walking?</p> Memories of Mackay  <p>Alex Montgomery, one of the great Fleet Street veterans, told a lovely story during the Football Writers\xe2\x80\x99 Association dinner about a trick Dave Mackay used to play on nights out when he would ask for someone to toss a coin in his direction.</p> <p>Mackay would trap it on his shoe to begin with. He would then flip it up on to his forehead and slide it down over one eye. Finally, he would drop it into his top pocket.</p> <p>Mackay was known more for his strength and force of personality rather than juggling skills but it was a reminder he deserves to be remembered for more than just that photograph he disliked so much of him and Billy Bremner.</p>'
