b'Tottenham Hotspur v West Ham: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 live! | Nick Ames'


b'<p>In the cold light of day, Spurs won\xe2\x80\x99t like their performance at all and West Ham will be pretty chuffed with theirs. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even as if Allardyce\xe2\x80\x99s men ran out of steam visibly. But at the moment, it simply looks like a winning draw for the home team \xe2\x80\x93 even if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help their top-four ambitions that much.</p> <p>We are also likely to be robbed of what would doubtless been some superb told-you-so press conferencery from Allardyce, which seems a bit cruel.</p> <p>Anyway, there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more for you to take in this afternoon so I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you to gather some breath before heading over to Michael Butler\xe2\x80\x99s Everton v Leicester MBM. And will I see you for Southampton v Liverpool at 4.15? Hope so. Ta-ta for now.</p>'
