b'Football transfer rumours: Manchester United in for Bruno Martins Indi?'


b'<p>The Mill is a believing sort. Really easily led. So when Louis van Gaal spoke up for his left-back last month, the Mill bought it. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect to see him linked with a different left-back for weeks and weeks.</p> <p>Three weeks, as it turns out. LVG\xe2\x80\x99s call for the England Under-21s to play Luke Shaw (\xe2\x80\x9cyoungsters have to play, they need match rhythm\xe2\x80\x9d) has softened a bit to: \xe2\x80\x9cyoungsters have to sit on the bench watching F\xc3\xa1bio Coentr\xc3\xa3o\xe2\x80\x9d. It\xe2\x80\x99s the rumour that won\xe2\x80\x99t stop, keeps re-appearing and so the Mill now believes that instead. That\xe2\x80\x99s how things work around here.</p> <p>Also set to feature in United\xe2\x80\x99s next big rebuild: Gerard Piqu\xc3\xa9, who was left out of Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s side for the second successive game (Chelsea, Manchester City and etc are also keen), and Porto\xe2\x80\x99s Bruno Martins Indi \xe2\x80\x93 whose World Cup highlights included getting a bubble of vanishing spray on his boots. Martins Indi spoke recently of a special connection to LVG, so it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely on. \xe2\x80\x9cSpiritually I still have contact with Van Gaal,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think about him and I think he also thinks about me.\xe2\x80\x9d LVG also thinks about Villa\xe2\x80\x99s Ron Vlaar, it says here. He thinks about him a lot.</p> <p>Meanwhile, financial-fair-play\xe2\x80\x99s QPR have been told it will cost them at least \xc2\xa310m to sign Jermain Defoe from Toronto in January; West Ham risk losing interesting-named wonderkid Reece Oxford as talks over a professional deal stall \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cseveral top clubs\xe2\x80\x9d fancy the teenage defender; and Joel Campbell wants to leave Arsenal. He was left out of the squad to face Burnley and Anderlecht, and has had it up to here.</p> <p>Manchester City plan to build on last night\xe2\x80\x99s success by luring \xc2\xa320m Marco Reus from Borussia Dortmund with a \xc2\xa3180,000-a-week salary. But Reus is still having none of any of it. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of people talk about my future. There is much speculation, a lot is being written. But other people think about me more than I do.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>And finally, some uplifting news, given the state the world is in. \xe2\x80\x9cDefiant Rio Ferdinand last night told The Sun: I won\xe2\x80\x99t quit Twitter. Rio vowed: \xe2\x80\x98I won\xe2\x80\x99t be quitting Twitter. I love it. I use it to talk to the fans.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d At last. We can all get on with our lives.</p>'
