b"Tim Howard: USA secretary of defence is just Everton's overrated keeper"


b'<p>It was the sixth goal that really took the cake. Tim Howard hadn\xe2\x80\x99t covered himself in glory for the previous five \xe2\x80\x93 through his legs, under his right hand, beaten at his near post, didn\xe2\x80\x99t dive, past him before he knew it \xe2\x80\x93 but the sixth goal Everton conceded against Chelsea on Saturday was really inept.</p> <p>But what vivid ineptitude! Muhamed Besic\xe2\x80\x99s back heel \xe2\x80\x93 what a first touch that was \xe2\x80\x93 started it. Then Phil Jagielka fell over. Sylvain Distin had a gallop \xe2\x80\xa6 and fell over. Then came Howard. As Diego Costa dummied, Howard went right, left, right \xe2\x80\x93 oops! Too far. Through the legs again. </p> <p>The subsequent somersault was acrobatic, at least. Howard finished up two yards past his goalpost, on the byline. An imaginative position, if nothing else.</p> <p>Everton were a shambles on Saturday, their zesty attacking outweighed by defending of the lowest order. Too much space, too much time. Chelsea picked them off with ease; like taking candy from a baby. For Evertonians, the aftermath was predictably miserablist. Sack the defence! Get Distin out! And Jagielka! Bring in Stones, bring in Alcaraz, maybe even bring back Moyes. </p> <p>In fairness, most acknowledged it was the defence\xe2\x80\x99s fault, not the goalkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s. But still. Six goals! Goalies live for clean sheets. Timmy is not going to be happy.</p> <p>Now cast your mind back to 1 July. The World Cup. USA played Belgium in Salvador. A humid evening. The Americans struggled; Belgium took command. But Howard repelled them. He made 16 saves; thwarted his opponents consistently. Belgium won, of course, but Howard\xe2\x80\x99s display merely strengthened his status. </p> <p>Even Barack Obama chimed in. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how you\xe2\x80\x99re going to survive the mobs when you come back home, man!\xe2\x80\x9d the president said. Comedians quipped: Howard \xe2\x80\x93 he\xe2\x80\x99s the new secretary of defense! The rest of the team could have used some of his blue-collar New Jersey work ethic. And so on.</p>         Howard\xe2\x80\x99s saves against Belgium.    <p>So here\xe2\x80\x99s one: how to reconcile the Howard from the Belgium game with the Howard against Chelsea? Soccer Star Ships Six! Secretary of Defense in Six Scandal! Oh well. Maybe Howard just had a bad day at the office. It happens, right?</p> <p>Or maybe he had a good day at the office against Belgium.</p> <p>Howard has pretty good numbers, as they say. He\xe2\x80\x99s played more than 300 games for Everton, 210 consecutively. A centurion for the USA. Holds Everton\xe2\x80\x99s record for clean sheets in a season. Third-best Premier League defence last term. Occasional goalscorer.</p> <p>He also looks the part. Talk about body beautiful: the shaved head, the luxuriant beard, the sculpted abs. Jesus, those abs! No daft Dmitri Kharine tracksuit bottoms for him. He\xe2\x80\x99s committed, hard-working, eloquent. Speaks well on TV as an NBC co-commentator. He\xe2\x80\x99s beaten Tourette\xe2\x80\x99s syndrome.</p> <p>But mistakes? He\xe2\x80\x99s made a few.</p> <p>This season has started inauspiciously. Ten goals given up already. Six conceded from eight shots on target against Chelsea. A naughty handball outside the area (unpunished); a naughtier cuff to Diego Costa\xe2\x80\x99s face. </p> <p>And it\xe2\x80\x99s not a new phenomenon. We know of Howard\xe2\x80\x99s travails at Manchester United, notably the fumble from the Benni McCarthy free-kick that knocked United out of Europe and sent Senhor Mourinho into paroxysms of ecstasy. But Howard\xe2\x80\x99s had mishaps at Everton as well, and the rollcall from seasons past is rather damning. </p> <p>Kalinic, Ramirez, Van der Vaart. Phil Neville\xe2\x80\x99s lol OG against Wigan. Kenwyne Jones for Stoke. Steven Gerrard in the cup. Many more. About 18 months ago, in a hot funk, admittedly, I calculated that in the 2012-13 season Howard had made at least 12 errors that had led directly to goals.</p>    <p>Tim Howard&#39;s errors: El Ahmadi, McAuley, Ba (two), Ramirez, Baines (og), Ruiz, Bassong, Kenwyne Jones, Van Persie, Sessegnon, Mata</p>&mdash; Tim Hill (@timmyhilleh) May 19, 2013    <p>Usually his mistakes aren\xe2\x80\x99t so obvious. Not for him the Austin Ejide hot potato, or the Bryan Gunn air kick, or the bar-of-soap Packie Bonner special. Robert Green he is not. But sometimes, just sometimes \xe2\x80\xa6 could he have done better? Should he have stopped that? Might he have come out sooner?</p> <p>For example: Javier Hernandez from literally two yards. Van Persie\xe2\x80\x99s pair of one-on-ones, again at Old Trafford. Grant Holt at Norwich. El Ahmadi for Villa. Demba Ba\xe2\x80\x99s couple against Newcastle? Didier Drogba\xe2\x80\x99s 30-yarder (freeze-frame that clip at 0:45 and see what you think). Dzeko and Ag\xc3\xbcero last year in the 3-2. Not obvious clangers, but enough to make you wonder.</p> <p>So what to make of all this? It seems churlish to criticise too much. Howard is venerated in the US, and Everton players past and present love him (his and Tim Cahill\xe2\x80\x99s is a bromance of rare beauty). Plus, if Howard\xe2\x80\x99s so bad, why does he keep getting picked? How come Joel Robles hasn\xe2\x80\x99t pushed him out? Why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t Brad Guzan?</p> <p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s be real. Of those 16 stops against Belgium, only the save with the feet from Kevin Mirallas could be classed as a really great one; the rest were essentially routine. And maybe Howard\xe2\x80\x99s status as USA\xe2\x80\x99s best player is a more a reflection of the relative paucity of overseas American stars, the team\xe2\x80\x99s recent improvement notwithstanding.</p>     All right \xe2\x80\x93 this one, from Diego Costa, he saved. Photograph: Ed Sykes/Action Images    <p>Tim Howard is a good guy, and a good goalkeeper. But he\xe2\x80\x99s perhaps not a great goalkeeper. As the Chelsea game showed, the beatification of St Timothy, post-Belgium, came too soon. He has too many flaws to be great, not least his insistence on staying deep and refusing to sweep, which presents a problem when Martinez wants his team to play a high line. (The reactive school of US keeping, as Jonathan Wilson puts it.) He\xe2\x80\x99s well thought of at Everton, but the reality is he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t get in the team at the top six clubs.</p> <p>So here\xe2\x80\x99s one to ponder. Howard\xe2\x80\x99s on sabbatical from the USMNT right now. He\xe2\x80\x99s 35, just shipped six, has undoubtedly lost some of his elasticity. Is it time for Jurgen Klinsmann to turn to someone else? Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s time to say thanks, and to move on. Maybe Everton should think of doing that too.</p>'
