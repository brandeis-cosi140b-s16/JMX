b'<p>Exultant Swansea fans go into the international break proclaiming \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re gonna win the league\xe2\x80\x9d after their best start to a season since 1923. It won\xe2\x80\x99t happen, of course, but if they can maintain their 100% record when they resume away to Chelsea on 13 September we will all need to reassess their potential.</p> <p>Roy Hodgson, the England manager, should be doing so already in the cases of Nathan Dyer, whose two goals here gave him three in as many games, and Jonjo Shelvey, who is in imperious form in midfield.</p> <p>Garry Monk believes both deserve to be in the squad for Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s friendly against Norway, but was not surprised by their omission. He said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to be watched to get selected and as far as I know Roy has never been here.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Swansea won even more convincingly than the scoreline would suggest. They would not have been flattered by a five-goal margin, such was their complete superiority over a West Brom team who needed penalties to see off League Two Oxford in the Capital One Cup in midweek.</p> <p>Albion avoided relegation by a single place last time and with two points from their first three games they need their unequalled array of new signings to settle in quickly if it is not to be another winter of discontent at the Hawthorns.</p> <p>The Swans\xe2\x80\x99 flying start to the season continued in more ways than one. They took the lead after only 88 seconds after a typically incisive passing move, which saw Dyer, Wilfried Bony and Gylfi Sigurdsson combine with classy cohesion on the right The attack culminated in Dyer working a smart one-two with Sigurdsson, whose intelligence and perception was at the root of all three goals. On this occasion the Icelander\xe2\x80\x99s clever backheel played in Dyer, who still had plenty to do. His finish, from right to left, was executed with the skill and accuracy of an international player, which on current form he should be.</p> <p>It was going to take something remarkable to eclipse that and Wayne Routledge managed it midway through the first half. Positioned on the edge of the D, he fastened on to Craig Dawson\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to clear Sigurdsson\xe2\x80\x99s cross and went into contortionist mode to get his body in the right shape to beat Ben Foster with a stunning volley into the goalkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s left-hand corner.</p> <p>At 2-0 the issue was effectively settled. Alan Irvine, Albion\xe2\x80\x99s new manager, said: \xe2\x80\x9cI spent time in the dressing room before the game talking about the importance of getting a good start, and we got the worst possible one. Before we knew it we were 2-0 down.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Nobody made more signings during the summer than West Brom \xe2\x80\x93 it will be 11 when Sebasti\xc3\xa1n Blanco, the Argentinian winger, completes his \xc2\xa31.6m move from Metalist Kharkiv. However, not many are deemed ready for action yet and Georgios Samaras, from Celtic, and Silvestre Varela, from Porto, are among those working to improve their fitness.</p> <p>Much is expected of Brown Ideye, the club record \xc2\xa310m recruit from Dynamo Kiev. The Nigerian striker had been disappointing on his first two appearances and he was anonymous again, although in mitigation his team-mates were so poor that he was denied proper service. When he did get a shooting chance, his response was little better than a back pass.</p> <p>Irvine said Ideye, too, was not ready, his preparations for the season interrupted by the situation in Ukraine, and that he played only because Victor Anichebe was injured.</p> <p>West Brom improved in the second half but had left themselves with too much to do and Dyer, set up by \xc3\x80ngel Rangel and Sigurdsson, scored his second after 71 minutes when firing low past Foster\xe2\x80\x99s outstretched leg from 15 yards.</p>'
