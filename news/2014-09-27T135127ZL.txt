b'Liverpool v Everton: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>Post-match musings from Chris Healy: \xe2\x80\x9cLiverpool have nobody to blame but themselves. Mario missed a great opportunity to put the Reds two up and then they just sat back and invited Everton to come at them. Credit to Jagielka, that will surely be a goal of the month contender. I\xe2\x80\x99m off to get drunk!\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>I\xe2\x80\x99m not, I\xe2\x80\x99ve another of these to do shortly. So that\xe2\x80\x99s all until...oooh...90 minutes or so from now. Join Nick Miller for his Clockwatch in the meantime. Enjoy yourselves.</p>'
