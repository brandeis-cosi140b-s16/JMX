b'Joe Hart backs Vincent Kompany to recover from Manchester City omission'


b'<p>Joe Hart believes Vincent Kompany will bounce back from being dropped for Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s victory over Leicester City, the goalkeeper stating how his own removal last season by Manuel Pellegrini taught him no player is \xe2\x80\x9cdestined\xe2\x80\x9d to feature in every match.</p> <p>Kompany was left on the bench at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday evening for the 2-0 win over the bottom-placed team, the central defender paying the price for his latest mistake at Anfield on Sunday, which led to Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s opening goal in the champions\xe2\x80\x99 2-1 defeat. While the Belgian has struggled for consistent form all season it was the first time in his seven-year City career Kompany had not been chosen due to playing reasons.</p> <p>However Hart, who was left out last season following a 2-1 defeat at Chelsea in which his mistake allowed Fernando Torres\xe2\x80\x99s late winner, said: \xe2\x80\x9cVinny appreciates, same as we all do, that sometimes the manager will change the squad. There is no one destined to play every single game \xe2\x80\x93 I have learned that lesson. Vinny\xe2\x80\x99s an unbelievable player, one of the best I have ever played with, and this was his night off. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he will be back in the team again with that captain\xe2\x80\x99s armband, being one of the best defenders in world football.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Speaking before helping City to what was only a ninth clean sheet of the league season, Hart accepted his side\xe2\x80\x99s faltering title defence has been down to poor defending. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not been good enough \xe2\x80\x93 we\xe2\x80\x99d all accept that \xe2\x80\x93 myself included,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs a team we have to accept that it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the back four and the goalkeeper when we defend \xe2\x80\x93 we defend as a team. I don\xe2\x80\x99t set out to be brutally honest but I\xe2\x80\x99d struggle to say things any other way. I\xe2\x80\x99d always protect my team and protect my team-mates but it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty hard to not tell the truth when millions of people have just watched what happened.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Hart is enjoying a fine personal campaign but is still keen to improve. \xe2\x80\x9cI am still learning the game, still growing into it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been here a long time but I want to keep improving and that is not going to change as long as I put on a Man City jersey. I am just enjoying the run of games I am involved in at the moment, and the opportunities that keep coming my way, and hope that I can keep taking them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>City, who trail Chelsea by five points and have played a game more, next play Burnley a week on Saturday as Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s side are not involved in the weekend\xe2\x80\x99s FA Cup action. \xe2\x80\x9cI have come to love playing every three or four days,\xe2\x80\x9d Hart said. \xe2\x80\x9cQuite recently we had one game every week, and it just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel right, but we are out of the Cup and have to accept it. We have the days off and have to use them to recover and get ready for Burnley.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
