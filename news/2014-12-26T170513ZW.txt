b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini is more interested in maintaining Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s imperious form in a critical week in the title contest than establishing a club record when Burnley visit the Etihad Stadium on Sunday.</p> <p>City equalled a club record established more than a century ago with a ninth successive victory to remain within three points of Chelsea at the top of the Premier League. They scored freely in the first half, when Fernando, Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 and David Silva put Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s side in complete control, before a second-half blizzard coated the Hawthorns pitch in snow and made City\xe2\x80\x99s players more concerned with keeping their feet.</p> <p>City have previously won nine games in succession on three occasions, most recently in 2011-12 under Roberto Mancini and also in 1909-10 and from April to September 1912.</p> <p>Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s priorities lie more with the here and now than in history. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not worried about records,\xe2\x80\x9d the City manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are worried about adding the points because it will be a very close challenge for the title. I have watched some games that Burnley play and they have good players. If you think it is an easy game, you can have problems.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s lunchtime win at West Ham United meant they maintained their advantage at the top of the table. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not thinking about Chelsea at the moment,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are thinking about the game with Burnley. There are 20 more games to play for the title. And the race for the title is not just two teams, I think others will be involved also. How many other teams? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. [Manchester] United, see if they keep winning, and other teams who can arrive at 86 points can win the title.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think this is a very important month and a key week because we play nine points in one week. It\xe2\x80\x99s important if we can get to the top as soon as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>This seventh consecutive league victory keeps City right on the coattails of Chelsea, before contrasting fixtures when the leaders travel to recovering Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur. After Burnley, City play Sunderland at home on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day. It appears a pivotal week.</p> <p>As Albion floundered around seeking consolation, Alan Irvine could claim that at least his side did not go under in the second half, but a sixth defeat in eight games leaves them two points above the relegation zone as they prepare to visit Stoke City on Sunday.</p> <p>The West Bromwich manager, who watched Brown Ideye score his first league goal for the club after Joe Hart missed a punch from Chris Brunt\xe2\x80\x99s corner with three minutes left, sounded less convinced of his own future than ever after only six months in charge. \xe2\x80\x9cThe chairman will make a decision about that,\xe2\x80\x9d Irvine said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the thinking is. All I can do is work as hard as I can and try to make sure we keep giving the right sorts of performances.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Albion desperately needed a win to restore confidence after their 3-2 defeat at While the referee, Mark Clattenburg, never appeared to consult with his fellow officials over whether the match should be completed, the ball did not roll as normal and City\xe2\x80\x99s players seemed to be avoiding going into unnecessary tackles as they refrained from chasing a goal avalanche in the second half.</p> <p>Queens Park Rangers where they had surrendered a 2-0 lead but their slim hopes of beating the champions were snuffed out in the first 34 minutes.</p> <p>Even with no striker on the field, City had far too much firepower for their opponents. If anything, having James Milner playing as the most advanced of six midfielders meant City\xe2\x80\x99s tempo and movement was better than ever. \xe2\x80\x9cJames is a very intelligent player,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe knows what movement he must make to create space for the others.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Within eight minutes City were ahead and Ben Foster was at fault. Jes\xc3\xbas Navas played a one-two with Tour\xc3\xa9 down the right and from his awkward cross the England squad goalkeeper fumbled the ball inside his six-yard area from where Fernando scored with an overhead kick as dextrous as it was surprising. It was only the Brazilian\xe2\x80\x99s second shot on target in the Premier League.</p> <p>Five minutes later Joleon Lescott, the former City defender, got some of the ball as he tackled Silva but Clattenburg had no hesitation in awarding a penalty. From the spot Tour\xc3\xa9 scored his sixth goal in nine games in all competitions.</p> <p>Albion were wholly lacking in conviction at this point. Even though they had been the better team at Loftus Road, and beaten Aston Villa 1-0 in their previous game at the Hawthorns, not even the return of Saido Berahino increased their belief. Indeed, it was their leading goalscorer who screwed his shots wide, twice, when fed by through balls from James Morrison, either side of City\xe2\x80\x99s third goal.</p> <p>After 34 minutes, Fernando was allowed to run clear from halfway to the edge of the Albion area where he switched the ball wide to Navas, who fed it back to Silva to side-foot home. Foster, presumably unsighted, barely moved.</p> <p>In the second half the yellow ball came into its own as the pitch turned white under the incessant snow, and the match resembled a sideshow to the conditions. For Albion, Silvestre Varela side-footed a half-volley wide from Andre Wisdom\xe2\x80\x99s cross to the far post, and Lescott headed over, before Ideye\xe2\x80\x99s goal, after City had dominated possession easily when no one went out of their way to risk falling over too much.</p> <p>Man of the match James Milner (Manchester City).</p> <p>West Bromwich Albion 4-1-2-3 Foster; Wisdom, McAuley, Lescott, Pocognoli (Gamboa, 66); Morrison; Mulumbu, Gardner (Brunt, 66); Varela (Ideye, 67), Sess\xc3\xa8gnon, Berahino.
