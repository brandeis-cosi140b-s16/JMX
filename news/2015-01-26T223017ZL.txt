b'Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Lucas Leiva wants past put right in Capital One Cup'


b'<p>Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s last League Cup visit to Stamford Bridge cost Lucas Leiva nine months of his career, the chance to play in two cup finals and to appear at Wembley three times under Kenny Dalglish. It will not be vengeance that fuels the Brazilian\xe2\x80\x99s return in the Capital One Cup semi-final on Tuesday, however, but a promise made to him by Steven Gerrard almost three years ago.</p> <p>On Sunday 26 February 2012, while Liverpool are en route to Wembley for the Carling Cup final against Cardiff City, a contest Dalglish\xe2\x80\x99s team will eventually win on penalties, a message arrives on Lucas\xe2\x80\x99s mobile. The midfielder has no part to play in the final, having ruptured a cruciate ligament in the 2-0 quarter\xe2\x80\x91final win at Chelsea three months previously, and is downbeat.</p> <p>As he recalls: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was hard for me and I was a little bit down because I wanted to be part of things on the pitch but I remember, when we were on our way to the stadium, Stevie sent me a text which said: \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, we will get here again.\xe2\x80\x99 It is something that I always remember, something nice, and hopefully we will make that come true.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Brendan Rodgers loth to risk Daniel Sturridge at Chelsea </p>   <p>Lucas did not receive a winners\xe2\x80\x99 medal at Wembley. Instead he was handed one at Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Melwood training ground after Dalglish and the then director of football, Damien Comolli, arranged an extra delivery. The medal, the midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s only one in almost eight years at Anfield, remains a source of pride despite missing the final.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI might not have played the final but my first medal for the club is important, I always look at it,\xe2\x80\x9d says the 28-year-old. \xe2\x80\x9cOther players may have won more but that first one was very important to me. I played until the quarter-final and I felt I deserved it because football is a team sport. That is the way I think.\xe2\x80\x9d And the way he plays.</p> <p>What appeared an innocuous collision with Ryan Bertrand in November 2011 cost Lucas more than a Wembley bow. He was overlooked by Brazil for almost two years after the injury, missed a once-in-a-lifetime World Cup on home soil after playing a bit-part role in Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s title challenge last season and believes it is only now, three years after being taken off against Chelsea on a stretcher, that he has recaptured his optimum level.</p> <p>Lucas admits: \xe2\x80\x9cI had a few problems after the injury and it is probably now that I am feeling my best in terms of sharpness and the way I want to play. The issues were about confidence and sharpness, confidence with myself really. With the way I play the injury was probably on my mind. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think about it when I made a tackle but, automatically when you have had an injury like that, maybe you don\xe2\x80\x99t go as hard as you can.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNow I feel like myself again and how I felt before the injury, which was probably my best moment for the club. I felt very well in the last 15 games I\xe2\x80\x99ve played and it is a question of keeping going. Hopefully we can have another good win at Chelsea like when I got the injury, but without the injury this time. I am looking forward to it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Not for the first time in his Anfield career Lucas has defied the doubters to demonstrate his importance to Liverpool. He has underpinned a steady recovery from the depths of November and Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s only defeat in their last 16 matches came when the midfielder was on the bench throughout the 3-0 reverse at Manchester United.</p> <p>Liverpool have taken 11 points from a possible 33 without Lucas in the starting line-up this season, 24 from a possible 33 with. There is arguably more satisfaction from his latest renaissance as the manager, Brendan Rodgers, was among the doubters until turning to the Brazilian after the dreadful 3-1 defeat at Crystal Palace.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe performance I had against Madrid [two games before] was probably good for me,\xe2\x80\x9d says Lucas. \xe2\x80\x9cWe lost but I played well. I spoke with the manager after that game and he said he was very happy with how I played. When we got the defeat against Palace, it was on his mind that I deserved a chance. Then Joe [Allen] got injured which opened another chance for me to keep playing and I tried to take it. I think I have nothing to lose. I have been here eight years and I am not trying to convince people, especially those on the outside, that I am good or bad or whatever.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Napoli and Internazionale have both shown an interest in Lucas and, despite Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 insistence that the midfielder will not be sold this month and that he does not want any other senior figures following Gerrard out of Anfield this summer, uncertainty reigns over his future.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe all know the relationship I have with Rafa,\xe2\x80\x9d says Lucas of Ben\xc3\xadtez\xe2\x80\x99s interest in a reunion in Naples. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for Rafa I probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be here. Rafa was so important for me, as Kenny was as well, and it is normal when you are out of the team. There are always rumours in the transfer window and it will be like that until the 2nd. I just have to focus on what I can control at the moment and see what happens.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI would be lying if I said I never thought about something new but I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you what is going to happen because it is football and we really don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I just focus on the day and leave the future to take care of itself.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
