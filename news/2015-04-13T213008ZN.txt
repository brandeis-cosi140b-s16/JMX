b'Nathaniel Clyne eyes Champions League stage after nailing England spot'


b'<p>Nathaniel Clyne has been told by Roy Hodgson that the England right-back berth is his if he maintains form and fitness, with the defender targeting an opportunity in the Champions League as he seeks to further his development.</p> <p>The full-back can still aspire to achieve qualification for Europe\xe2\x80\x99s elite competition with Southampton, who trail the top four by five points with six games to play, but is expected to make clear his future intentions in talks with the club\xe2\x80\x99s hierarchy this summer.</p> <p>Clyne will enter the final year of his contract at St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s in July and has yet to indicate a desire to extend his stay on the south coast, with Chelsea and Manchester United among the potential suitors.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI see myself hopefully playing in the Champions League and competing for titles and trophies,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Crystal Palace academy graduate, who was speaking at a FootballFightingEbola charity event. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99m aiming for. I\xe2\x80\x99m definitely ambitious. Every player would love to be playing in the Champions League and winning trophies and titles. That\xe2\x80\x99s what you play football for, that\xe2\x80\x99s the dream.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI would say [Champions League football] is the next step in my progression. I think I need experience playing European football. We\xe2\x80\x99re doing well with Southampton and hopefully we can get there. That would be great. So I\xe2\x80\x99m just concentrating on Southampton. There are a few more games to play, so I\xe2\x80\x99m just concentrating on getting to the fourth spot.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cCity lost on Sunday, and there are still a few games to go and a lot of points to pick up. If we keep on winning and perform how we are performing, and one or two teams on top of us slip up, we can force our way into that top four.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Clyne\xe2\x80\x99s progress in the top flight with Southampton was rewarded with a first England call-up in the autumn, with the right-back impressive over his four caps by offering defensive nous and energy in attack down the flank. The 24-year-olddeparted the last get-together with praise from Hodgson ringing in his ears.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe just said: \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99ve done ever so well since coming in. It\xe2\x80\x99s like you have been playing international football for a long time. The right-back spot is yours at the moment, if you can continue on,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said the defender. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has the belief I will.\xe2\x80\x9cHe just gave me confidence, really. If I keep on putting in performances and keep on improving as a player, I can hopefully make the position my own and look to make tournaments, and hopefully win tournaments, with England as well. I feel as if I\xe2\x80\x99ve settled in well at that level with the squad so far, but I\xe2\x80\x99m hungry for more.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe manager has freshened things a bit since the World Cup last summer. You can see that in our performances. We are more pacy, he is bringing a lot of quick players in with youth, and we\xe2\x80\x99re looking a lot more threatening. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had advice, too, from Gary Neville who told me to go out there and be confident. He told me: \xe2\x80\x98Play your normal game because that\xe2\x80\x99s what got you the call-up in the first place. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about anything. You\xe2\x80\x99re as good as everyone else that\xe2\x80\x99s there.\xe2\x80\x99 He\xe2\x80\x99s just building confidence for me. That was nice and made me feel I deserved to be there.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Clyne, who was rested for Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s victory over Hull City, has acknowledged the impact made by Koeman on his game this season. \xe2\x80\x9cI would say he has improved my game,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe does individual training with the full-backs and defence, how to receive the ball, where you position yourself on the field, how to create chances for the attackers, and is banging belief into me and the players that we can go out there and be fighting with the best. He\xe2\x80\x99s let me go free and attack, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve remained solid in defence. It\xe2\x80\x99s helped us as you can see in the league. We\xe2\x80\x99re fifth and still pushing for that fourth spot.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>To donate to FootballFightingEbola visit virginmoneygiving.com/FootballFightingEbola or text \xe2\x80\x98STOPEBOLA\xe2\x80\x99 to 70030 which automatically gives \xc2\xa310</p>'
