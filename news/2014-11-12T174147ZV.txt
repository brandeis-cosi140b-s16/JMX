b'<p>The Spain coach, Vicente del Bosque, has accepted Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas\xe2\x80\x99s explanation that he is suffering discomfort in his hamstring despite MRI scans taken by the national federation\xe2\x80\x99s medical staff having apparently failed to identify a serious injury.</p> <p>F\xc3\xa0bregas played the whole of Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League victory at Liverpool on Saturday, having also featured for 90 minutes in the midweek Champions League draw in Maribor, but has been released from the Spain squad for their Euro 2016 qualifier against Belarus on Saturday and next week\xe2\x80\x99s friendly with Germany in Vigo. The 27-year-old was checked by the Spanish Federation in Madrid earlier this week and has since returned to Cobham for treatment.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe had to wait a few days to evaluate Cesc\xe2\x80\x99s injury and we opted for him not to continue with us,\xe2\x80\x9d Del Bosque told the Spanish radio station Onda Cero. \xe2\x80\x9cAt times we have been flexible but not in this case. His muscle seems all right but he complains and he is the best doctor. I prefer not to be deceived but I cannot be distrustful. When a player of his calibre tells you that he is injured, you have to believe him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>F\xc3\xa0bregas joins another Spain international at Chelsea, Diego Costa, in playing no part in the two forthcoming internationals with the Brazil-born forward \xe2\x80\x93 who scored the winner at Anfield \xe2\x80\x93 having been omitted from Del Bosque\xe2\x80\x99s party to rest recent hamstring and groin complaints.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn our previous training camp, he complained about pain in his pelvic bone,\xe2\x80\x9d Del Bosque said of Costa. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought it was best for him to take a break. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a sign of weakness, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to confront anyone.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I gave my 23-man squad, I knew that Costa was going to play with his club at the weekend [at Liverpool]. But we cannot push someone when they don\xe2\x80\x99t feel completely well. He is the first one that has asked us to \xe2\x80\x98please not forget him\xe2\x80\x99 when I make my next squad selection in February.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>F\xc3\xa0bregas will continue to be monitored by Chelsea, whose next game is against West Bromwich Albion at Stamford Bridge on 22 November, with the Premier League leaders reluctant as yet to indicate the extent of the injury heF\xc3\xa0bregas has sustained. Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho had admitted he had taken a gamble in playing the midfielder on Merseyside given that he already had the problem.</p>'
