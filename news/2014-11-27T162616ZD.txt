b'Dave Whelan charged by FA over antisemitic comments'


b'<p>Dave Whelan could be ordered to take an equality and diversity education course if the Football Association finds him guilty of aggravated misconduct over his comments to the Guardian about Jewish and Chinese people. Whelan is likely also to be fined if found guilty. FA sanctions, which were overhauled last year, also provide for directors to be barred from football stadiums for a period of time, although there is no indication yet that this would be considered.</p> <p>The FA charged Whelan with an aggravated breach of its rule against improper conduct and bringing the game into disrepute, just one day after receiving the Wigan Athletic owner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cobservations\xe2\x80\x9d on Wednesday about his comments. Football\xe2\x80\x99s governing body said it is alleged Whelan breached the relevant rule, E3(1) of the FA handbook, because his comments were \xe2\x80\x9cabusive and/or insulting and/or constitute improper conduct and/or bring the game into disrepute\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>The charge alleges this breach was \xe2\x80\x9caggravated\xe2\x80\x9d, according to the FA\xe2\x80\x99s rule E3(2), because \xe2\x80\x9cit included a reference to ethnic origin and/or race and/or nationality and/or religion or belief\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>This is the same aggravated rule breach of which Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez and Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s John Terry were found guilty for on-field abuse of rival players, and West Bromwich Albion\xe2\x80\x99s Nicolas Anelka for using the antisemitic \xe2\x80\x9cquenelle\xe2\x80\x9d gesture.</p> <p>Whelan made his comments to the Guardian, and other remarks to other media outlets, after appointing Malky Mackay as Wigan\xe2\x80\x99s manager last week. Mackay is still under FA investigation for alleged similar aggravated misconduct in text and email messages he exchanged while he was the manager of Cardiff City with that club\xe2\x80\x99s then head of recruitment, Iain Moody. Mackay\xe2\x80\x99s messages, which Whelan said he did not believe were offensive, included a statement about the football agent Phil Smith, who is Jewish: \xe2\x80\x9cNothing like a Jew that sees money slipping through his fingers.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Mackay also referred to Vincent Tan, the Malaysian Cardiff City owner, as \xe2\x80\x9cthe chink\xe2\x80\x9d and made an allegedly derogatory remark in relation to the South Korean international Kim Bo-kyung.</p> <p>Explaining why he was relaxed about appointing Mackay with the FA\xe2\x80\x99s investigation still ongoing, and did not believe these messages were offensive, Whelan compared use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cchink\xe2\x80\x9d to describing a British person as a \xe2\x80\x9cBrit\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Of the Smith comment, at first he said Mackay was only reflecting that Jewish people \xe2\x80\x9clove money\xe2\x80\x9d like everybody does, and so do not like losing money. Asked if he did not believe the comment actually was offensive because claiming Jews \xe2\x80\x9clove money\xe2\x80\x9d has been used as a negative stereotype, Whelan told the Guardian he believed \xe2\x80\x9cJewish people chase money more than everybody else\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>He said that was not offensive because Jews are \xe2\x80\x9cshrewd people\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>The remarks were strongly condemned by Jewish and Chinese community groups. The British Chinese Project and seven other Chinese political and cultural organisations welcomed the FA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cquick, decisive\xe2\x80\x9d charging of Whelan. In a statement after Whelan\xe2\x80\x99s comments, the organisations said emphatically the word \xe2\x80\x9cchink\xe2\x80\x9d is racist.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cTo draw a parallel [between using the word \xe2\x80\x9cchink\xe2\x80\x9d and describing a British person as a Brit] is ignorant and offensive,\xe2\x80\x9d the statement said, \xe2\x80\x9cas it fails to understand the nature of racism and belittles the experiences of those who have suffered racism.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The FA\xe2\x80\x99s charge was also welcomed by the Board of Deputies of British Jews. \xe2\x80\x9cWe commend the FA for acting quickly and decisively, sending out a message to players and supporters that racist and divisive language of the kind that Whelan has used will not be tolerated either on or off the pitch. We will be watching the result closely,\xe2\x80\x9d said their vice president, Jonathan Arkush.</p> <p>Whelan has six full working days, to 6pm on 5 December, to respond to the charge.</p>'
