b'<p>Arsenal have their momentum. This had been billed as the night when they would build on the encouraging wins over Borussia Dortmund and West Bromwich Albion, in which they had kept clean sheets but, for so long, it looked as if they would get only one part of the equation right.</p> <p>Southampton were well-drilled, tidy in possession and they flickered on the counter. For 70 minutes the visitors were the better team and the crowd bubbled with frustration. Too much of Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s passing was off-kilter.</p> <p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s decision to substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who had been just about the pick of the home team\xe2\x80\x99s attacking players, was greeted by boos and it seemed like an illustration of how fragile the mood can be in these parts. Wenger spoke afterwards of how the crowd\xe2\x80\x99s nerves had been transmitted to the players.</p> <p>The man who replaced Oxlade-Chamberlain made the difference. Olivier Giroud showcased his physical strength, touch and eye for goal, bringing one particularly outstanding save from the impressive Fraser Forster.</p> <p>But Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s resistance broke after the cruellest of mishaps. Ronald Koeman had used his three substitutes \xe2\x80\x93 the first two after injuries to Jack Cork and Dusan Tadic following late tackles from Aaron Ramsey and Santi Cazorla respectively \xe2\x80\x93 when Toby Alderweireld felt a hamstring twang on 84 minutes. He had to go off, leaving Southampton to try to cling on with 10 men.</p> <p>They could not do so. After Forster\xe2\x80\x99s world-class, one-handed save from Giroud\xe2\x80\x99s header, Arsenal sensed the decisive moment was close and it came after Jos\xc3\xa9 Fonte appeared to have handled inside the area under pressure from Giroud.</p> <p>The referee, Andre Marriner, who was officiating his first Arsenal game since he mistakenly sent off Kieran Gibbs at Chelsea last March, was not swayed and it was left to Ramsey to recycle the move to the right of goal.</p> <p>Southampton crowded three men towards him but he fashioned a low cut-back and there was Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez, timing his arrival in predatory fashion, to guide a low shot home from close range. Wenger said S\xc3\xa1nchez was one of the players who had needed to dig deep into his reserves of stamina but the Chilean has shown his fighting qualities on numerous occasions. It was his 14th goal for the club and, remarkably, the eighth time he has scored at 0-0. Southampton were crushed.</p> <p>Koeman made the point that it was hard enough with 11 men at the Emirates and he felt that Alderweireld\xe2\x80\x99s injury had given Arsenal \xe2\x80\x9ca step back into the game\xe2\x80\x9d. He did not complain about the tackles on Cork and Tadic \xe2\x80\x93 kicks can happen \xe2\x80\x93 but he voiced his frustration at how the relentless schedule in English football was placing too great a strain on clubs such as Southampton. This was the reason why Alderweireld\xe2\x80\x99s hamstring had buckled.</p> <p>Memo to Ronald: it is only going to get worse over Christmas. He suggested that he may have to move for reinforcements in January.</p> <p>Southampton have lost to Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester City and Arsenal but, until Giroud\xe2\x80\x99s introduction, they had looked set to enjoy some reward. Their football at the outset was balanced and easy on the eye, and Graziano Pell\xc3\xa8 should have scored after a neat interchange with Steven Davis. The finish was wild. Koeman would also point to Shane Long\xe2\x80\x99s chance on the break in the 52nd minute. He ought to have crossed for Pell\xc3\xa8 in front of goal rather than shoot.</p> <p>Arsenal had offered little apart from Danny Welbeck\xe2\x80\x99s glancing header in first-half injury-time from Cazorla\xe2\x80\x99s free-kick which Forster tipped over in spectacular fashion, but Giroud stirred them.</p> <p>With virtually his first touch on 70 minutes he clubbed a shot from a tight angle that Forster beat clear and moments later his flick set Welbeck clear. Forster made another fine save.</p> <p>Arsenal came on strong in the end and, after the goal, Forster denied Ramsey and S\xc3\xa1nchez might have had a penalty for the substitute Maya Yoshida\xe2\x80\x99s challenge. Wenger made the valid point that his team had created the better chances and he praised them for showing patience. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was not our usual fluency,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s important to win when it\xe2\x80\x99s not perfect.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
