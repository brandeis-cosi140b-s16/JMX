b'Liverpool won\xe2\x80\x99t keep Steven Gerrard for sentiment, says Brendan Rodgers'


b'<p>Brendan Rodgers believes Steven Gerrard has been a made a scapegoat for Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s recent stumbles and says his desire to extend the 34-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s contract is not based on emotion.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not sentimental,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rodgers after revealing he had opened talks with his captain\xe2\x80\x99s agent about renewing a deal due to expire in June. With Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s manager having also informed the Anfield board that retaining Gerrard ranks among his top priorities and a potential player-coaching role not having been ruled out of the equation, the midfielder seems unlikely to leave Merseyside next summer.</p> <p>By then Gerrard will be 35 but Rodgers, whose side lost 1-0 at Newcastle on Saturday, does not doubt his enduring capacity to continue as Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s midfield cornerstone. \xe2\x80\x9cAs manager of this club you can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to be sentimental,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut both on an off the field, as a leader and as a captain, I want to ensure that Steven is very much part of this second curve we\xe2\x80\x99re on in terms of group development.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe the team hasn\xe2\x80\x99t played so well this season and maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s a focus on Steven but he\xe2\x80\x99s been absolutely brilliant for me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Rodgers is clearly irked by recent theories that the the ageing Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s reduced dynamism represents a key part of Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s current problems rather than a big element of the solution to their transition to life after Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you see some of his passes and his influence in the changing room he\xe2\x80\x99s still an outstanding player,\xe2\x80\x9d said a manager whose team currently trail the Premier League leaders, Chelsea, by 12 points and travel to Real Madrid on Champions League duty on Tuesday seeking to avenge last month\xe2\x80\x99s 3-0 Anfield reverse against Carlo Ancelotti\xe2\x80\x99s side.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSteven will be 35 in May but he\xe2\x80\x99s still fresh and he still looks after himself very well. Technically he\xe2\x80\x99s a big player for us and he offers the perfect example for a lot of our players to learn from.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Although suggestions that Manuel Pellegrini is keen to transplant Gerrard to Manchester City appear overblown, the former England captain\xe2\x80\x99s status as a free agent would be unlikely to leave this quintessential one-club man short of offers in January when he could sign a pre-contract agreement elsewhere.</p> <p>Rodgers \xe2\x80\x93 who said the possibility of Gerrard combining playing with coaching was a topic for \xe2\x80\x9canother day\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 is anxious to deter suitors. \xe2\x80\x9cI came here when Steven was 32, had struggled with injury and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t played consistently over a number of years,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I sold him the idea, the philosophy of how we wanted to work and his importance to it and, on and off the field, he\xe2\x80\x99s been absolutely brilliant.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
