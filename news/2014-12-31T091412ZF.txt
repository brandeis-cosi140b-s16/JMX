b'Football transfer rumours: Chelsea or Man City to sign \xc2\xa330m Wilfried Bony?'


b'<p>Big plans tonight, readers? Same. The Mill plans to spend the entire evening in front of Sky Sports News, waiting for the clock to strike midnight, at which point the fireworks will start cracking and Jim White will cartwheel into the studio, having been released from his four-month hibernation. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s on!\xe2\x80\x9d he\xe2\x80\x99ll shout. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s on!\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>And it will be on. The transfer window will be open and Jim White will feel alive again. Exciting! There\xe2\x80\x99s so much on the agenda. For instance, Crystal Palace\xe2\x80\x99s incoming manager Alan Pardew was so impressed with Jonjo Shelvey\xe2\x80\x99s special performance against Liverpool on Monday night that he wants to make the Swansea City midfielder his. When you\xe2\x80\x99re the king, you can do what you want.</p> <p>It could be a difficult month for Swansea, though, with news also emerging that Chelsea and Manchester City could be preparing \xc2\xa330m bids for Wilfried Bony. Congratulations to Swansea for doing their scouting for them. That will surely be of some consolation.</p> <p>Liverpool are also after a new striker and have identified Villarreal\xe2\x80\x99s Luciano Vietto as The One. Apparently he\xe2\x80\x99s the new Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero. Although knowing Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s luck, he\xe2\x80\x99ll probably turn out to be the new Mauro Boselli.</p> <p>Tottenham Hotspur would like to sign Danny Ings, which means that Burnley will be treated to the joys of negotiating with Daniel Levy. Lucky them!</p> <p>Tony Pulis wants \xc2\xa32m a year to become West Bromwich Albion\xe2\x80\x99s new manager. How many baseball caps could you buy with that money?</p> <p>The new Freddy Adu, Martin Odegaard, could be heading to Southampton, who also want to sign Toby Alderweireld permanently from Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid.</p> <p>Arsenal might launch a \xc2\xa325.5m bid for Sporting Lisbon\xe2\x80\x99s William Carvalho. He\xe2\x80\x99s a defensive midfielder. So that won\xe2\x80\x99t be happening.</p> <p>And Norwich City are convinced that Scott Sinclair is real and plan to prove it by signing the Manchester City \xe2\x80\xa6 actually, what is he? Winger? Club secretary? Programme seller? Big screen operator? Does anybody know?</p>'
