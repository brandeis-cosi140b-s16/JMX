b'Fifa Club World Cup 2014 in Morocco \xe2\x80\x93 a club by club guide'


b'<p>The Club World Cup kicks off on Wednesday and for the second year running it is being held in Morocco.</p> <p>Since the inaugural competition in 2000, when Manchester United sunned themselves on Brazilian beaches, pulled out of the FA Cup and then romped to the league title, the Club World Cup has evolved and while United were an unmitigated disaster on the pitch 14 years ago, European teams have come to dominate.</p> <p>Corinthians\xe2\x80\x99 victory in 2012, when Chelsea were defeated in the final, aside, the Club World Cup has been the preserve of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League winners since 2007 \xe2\x80\x93 Bayern Munich the most recent champions \xe2\x80\x93 and Real Madrid go into the competition as favourites. Here we take a look at the six other clubs looking to cause an upset and how they can plot a route to the final on 20 December in Marrakesh.</p> Moghreb T\xc3\xa9touan, Morocco <p>Qualifying as the champions of Morocco, Moghreb T\xc3\xa9touan will be looking to follow in the footsteps of Raja Casablanca, who progressed to the final last year, before succumbing to Bayern. They kick off the tournament with the play-off to reach the quarter-finals against Auckland City and do so on the back of some pretty average domestic form \xe2\x80\x93 a problem their striker Mouhcine Iajour puts down to the expectation surrounding the Club World Cup. Fortunately for T\xc3\xa9touan, Iajour starred for Raja in last year\xe2\x80\x99s competition before making his switch to the champions. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope to get Cristiano Ronaldo\xe2\x80\x99s jersey because he\xe2\x80\x99s the best player in the world,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf that match does come around, then there\xe2\x80\x99s no way I\xe2\x80\x99m not changing my shirt with him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Auckland City, New Zealand <p>Seasoned campaigners \xe2\x80\x93 Auckland\xe2\x80\x99s sixth appearance is a competition record \xe2\x80\x93 but the New Zealanders, who qualify virtue of their victory in the OFC Champions League, are looking to make it into the quarter-finals for only the second time. Coached by the Spaniard Ramon Tribulietx, Auckland won the inaugural OFC President\xe2\x80\x99s Cup last month, and have the former Blackburn Rovers midfielder Tim Payne among their ranks. Payne has been quick to heap the pressure on Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s opponents. \xe2\x80\x9cPlaying at home gives any team a massive lift so for us going to Morocco to face T\xc3\xa9touan is going to be tough. But, again, this is a one-off game and anything can happen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> ES Setif, Algeria <p>Awaiting the winners of Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s curtain-raiser, Setif are looking to back up Algeria\xe2\x80\x99s promising showing in the summer\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup in Brazil, where they became the only African country to reach the knockout stages. Taking their place in Morocco thanks to a second CAF Champions League title \xe2\x80\x93 26 years after their first \xe2\x80\x93 Setif have set their sights on reaching the semi-finals but fatigue might be a problem. They have played eight matches in the Algerian league in 28 days but the manager, Kheireddine Madoui, remains bullish. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will play the tournament without any pressure, but we will play with big a desire to make Algerian football proud,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> Cruz Azul, Mexico <p>Making their first appearance, the Mexican side Cruz Azul celebrated their sixth Concacaf Champions League in April but they have had little to cheer since and their most recent domestic campaign saw them end up down in 13th spot. In Luis Fernando Tena they have a manager who, against the odds guided Mexico to Olympic Games gold at London 2012, orchestrating the victory in the final over Brazil at Wembley. The goalkeeper Jes\xc3\xbas Corona remembers well Tena\xe2\x80\x99s impact at the Olympics and hopes he can have a similar effect in Morocco, starting with their quarter-final against Western Sydney Wanderers. \xe2\x80\x9cThe team talk he gave us before the final against Brazil really pumped us up,\xe2\x80\x9d Corona said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe told us to go for it and that a lot of people would remember us for many years to come, which filled us with pride. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same thing here.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Western Sydney Wanderers, Australia <p>Winners of the AFC Champions League, Western Sydney Wanderers\xe2\x80\x99 preparations for Morocco have been dominated by a threatened boycott of the competition because of a pay dispute. Apparently, club officials have offered their players a 10% share of the money received for qualifying but the squad, rooted to the foot of the A-League, want more. As it stands, Western Sydney are due to face Cruz Azul in the quarter-finals on 13 December in Rabat but that seems anything but certain. Victory over the Mexican opponents would pave the way for a semi-final with Real Madrid, something the defender Matt Spiranovic spoke passionately about last month. He said: \xe2\x80\x9cIf we were able to step into the same pitch as Real Madrid it would be a dream come true for a lot of the boys.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> San Lorenzo, Argentina <p>Entering the competition at the semi-final stage and widely viewed as Real Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s nearest challengers, San Lorenzo won their first Copa Libertadores title earlier this year with victory over Club Nacional of Paraguay in the final and ending Brazilian clubs\xe2\x80\x99 four-year dominance in the process. They boast few household names but did recruit the Colombia defender Mario Yepes after his World Cup heroics. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re a team of fighters. We keep on battling until the very last minute, and we need to take that spirit with us to Morocco,\xe2\x80\x9d the 38-year-old Yepes said.</p>     Mario Yepes joined the Copa Libertadores champions, San Lorenzo, after featuring at the World Cup with Colombia.

Currently on the back of an 19-match winning streak and with Cristiano Ronaldo having scored 32 goals this season for club and country, Real\xe2\x80\x99s main obstacle would appear to be complacency. James Rodr\xc3\xadguez is likely to be missing but Ronaldo and Toni Kroos will be bidding for their second World Club Cup titles. The right-back Dani Carvajal says there will be no taking it easy in Morocco. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a dream for me to compete in it because of how hard it is to qualify and I\xe2\x80\x99ll try to enjoy it as much as possible,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be special to win it but it won\xe2\x80\x99t be easy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Club World Cup fixtures <p>Play-off: Moghreb T\xc3\xa9touan v Auckland City, 10 December</p> <p>Quarter-final 1: Es Setif v winner of play-off, 13 December</p> <p>Quarter-final 2: Cruz Azul v West Sydney Warriors, 13 December</p> <p>Semi-final 1: winner of quarter-final 2 v Real Madrid, 16 December</p> <p>Semi-final 2: winner of quarter-final 1 v San Lorenzo, 17 December</p> <p>Fifth place play-off: loser of quarter-final 1 v loser of quarter-final 2, 17 December</p> <p>Third place play-off: loser of semi-final 1 v loser of semi-final 2, 20 December</p> <p>Final: winner of semi-final 1 v winner of semi-final 2, 20 December</p>'
