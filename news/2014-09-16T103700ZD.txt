b'<p>Didier Drogba trained with his Chelsea team-mates at Cobham on Tuesday morning as he attempted to make a return to the Champions League with the London club in their opening Group G fixture against Schalke.</p> <p>The Ivorian had injured his right ankle in training last Friday with the joint still swollen over the weekend. That had ruled him out of Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s 4-2 win over Swansea and the management had anticipated being without the 36-year-old on Wednesday.</p> <p>However, his presence on the pitch at Cobham would suggest he has recovered sufficiently to play a part, if required, against the Germans with Diego Costa or Loic R\xc3\xa9my still expected to start the game. Chelsea trained with a full complement of players as they prepared for their first group game.</p> <p>Although he played for Galatasaray at Stamford Bridge in Europe\xe2\x80\x99s elite competition last season, his last touch as a Chelsea player in the Champions League remains the penalty converted beyond Bayern Munich\xe2\x80\x99s Manuel Neuer in the 2012 final which secured the club their first European Cup.</p> <p>The Schalke captain Benedikt H\xc3\xb6wedes has not travelled with the team to London after staying behind for tests on a hip injury.</p> <p>The defender, who was injured in their 4-1 defeat by Borussia M\xc3\xb6nchengladbach on Saturday and partially tore a hip tendon, may travel later, the club said.</p>'
