b'The Fiver | If only all men named Frank could be as decisive'


b'<p>START SPREADING THE NEWS </p> <p>In his famous ditty about leaving for New York, Frank Sinatra couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been more clear about his destination and date of departure. His overwhelming desire to \xe2\x80\x9cbe a part of it\xe2\x80\x9d, coupled with the urge of his vagabond shoes to stray \xe2\x80\x9cright through the very heart of it\xe2\x80\x9d prompted the singer to inform anyone who was interested that he\xe2\x80\x99d be \xe2\x80\x9cleaving today\xe2\x80\x9d. Yes, today. Not tomorrow. Not in a month\xe2\x80\x99s time and certainly not at the end of June. If only all men named Frank could be as decisive.</p> <p>Following weeks of speculation about his departure date for the city that never sleeps, Frank Lampard today moved to put an end to the \xe2\x80\x9clies and nonsense\xe2\x80\x9d surrounding his impending move to New York, by announcing that his Adidas Vagabonds would be staying in the boot-room at the Etihad until the end of the Premier League season, when in fact supporters of New York City FC had been led to believe that he\xe2\x80\x99d signed a contract to play for them from 1 January. Sadly for those supporters of the new franchise expecting to see Frank line out for their team at the start of the MLS season, it seems Frank hadn\xe2\x80\x99t actually signed a contract, as the club clearly stated, but had in fact merely inked a \xe2\x80\x9ccommitment\xe2\x80\x9d, which it seems is kind of like a contract, but differs in so much as it\xe2\x80\x99s not actually something to which one is any way obliged to \xe2\x80\xa6 er, commit.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI want to make it completely clear as I have read a lot of lies and nonsense over the last few days,\xe2\x80\x9d parped Frank on his Facebook page. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x99When released from Chelsea last year at the end of my contract I signed a commitment to play in NYC FC for two years starting 1 January 2015. I was then offered the chance to train and be part of the Man City squad in the interim to keep myself in the best shape going into New York. This period has since been extended by Man City and I now will start playing for NYC FC at the end of this current Premier League season. There has always been a constant dialogue between all parties in this time to find the best solution for everyone. I can say that I am very excited about arriving in New York and giving everything to the team to make us a success in the MLS as soon as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As well as committing the cardinal but not uncommon sin of referring to MLS as \xe2\x80\x9cthe MLS\xe2\x80\x9d, Frank\xe2\x80\x99s failure to mention that Manchester City and NYC FC are owned by the same people would appear to constitute another minor oversight. Perhaps he presumed everybody already knows? Perhaps he thought there was little point in riffing on the pain of NYC FC fans who might not know? Perhaps he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know? After all, he\xe2\x80\x99s currently playing for a team that today issued a statement that: a) stated two of their previous statements on the matter contained errors; b) directly contradicted a statement released by the Premier League; and c) admitted they found legal jargon confusing. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good job they\xe2\x80\x99re not one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s richest sports organisations? Eh? Oh. Anyway, whether they like or not, the upshot for NYC FC fans is that they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to get used to the idea that, unlike Sinatra, their Frank will be hanging around for another five months before his Manchester blue starts melting away and he\xe2\x80\x99s making a brand new start of it in old New York.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe said nothing to me. He did not call me or say goodbye. I don\xe2\x80\x99t need flowers or a kiss from him. But it is about respect, about saying goodbye. For me respect is important\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Lukas Podolski weeps over his break-up from Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger while posting the day\xe2\x80\x99s 37th selfie on Instagram.</p>     R.E.S.P.E.C.T. Photograph: Martin Rose/Bongarts/Getty Images    FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn relation to Wojciech Szczesny\xe2\x80\x99s dad comparing Per Mertesacker to a rhino (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Quote of the Day), was it definitely a \xe2\x80\x98pop\xe2\x80\x99 at the defender? You see, as well as being strong and solid, rhinoceros are very agile animals. According to the Borneo Rhino Alliance, Rhinos can run at speeds of 40-50kph and can do a 180-degree spin in a single jump. If he did want to use an animal to ridicule poor Per with via comparison, might I suggest the Malay chicken? It is the tallest breed of chicken in the world, wanders around aimlessly and can\xe2\x80\x99t get off the ground\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Conor O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cApropos the letter from Blackeye Rovers fan Marten Allen (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters). I was reminded of the time when, as a cheeky schoolboy, I armed myself with two toilet rolls and stood on the Kop at Elland Road in January 1977 as my boys thrashed Norwich City 5-2 in the third round of the FA Cup (those were the days, hey). Two toilet rolls \xe2\x80\xa6 and five goals to celebrate. Suffice to say neither bog-roll deployed properly \xe2\x80\xa6 both flying unfurled no more that 20 feet forward towards the front of the stand, no doubt to the bemusement of those they hit on the way. It would have helped my cause no end if I had just thought to break that little seal you get on the first sheet. We live and learn\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Allastair McGillivray.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis week\xe2\x80\x99s letters on ill-fated supporter flaggery recalled a childhood debacle in my early life as a football fan in Austria. I was only about 11 years old, and a good friend and I had tickets to watch a league match at the home ground of the club we passionately supported, SK Voest Linz (which has since collapsed and risen from the ashes in the form of Blau-Weiss Linz, in a fashion not too dissimilar from the AFC Wimbledon metamorphosis). We didn\xe2\x80\x99t have any money to buy a proper blue-and-white flag, but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t care. We found a white bed sheet and eagerly hand-painted it with the club\xe2\x80\x99s blue crest. A stick and some string, and our flag was ready to unfurl in pre-teen matchday glory. Once in the stands, we waved the thing with all our might and screamed ourselves hoarse in support of our team. That night we huddled around the TV to see our proud flag among the sports news highlights. When the camera panned over the stand where we stood, we realised in horror that the blue paint we used was much too pale to show up on the screen. It looked like we were waving a white flag\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Peter Oh.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
