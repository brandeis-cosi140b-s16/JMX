b'Manchester United should put Chelsea on back seat, says Marouane Fellaini'


b'<p>Marouane Fellaini has said Manchester United must concentrate on maintaining their form instead of worrying about whether Chelsea are going to slip up and let them back into the title race.</p> <p>United\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 victory over Stoke on Tuesday extended their winning run to four matches and kept them in fourth place. However, Chelsea remain a considerable distance away at the top and Fellaini believes it is important United do not lose focus when they visit Southampton on Monday.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think we wait for a mistake but we have to look for us, we have take it game by game and we will see after,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fellaini who scored the opening goal against Stoke. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter Boxing Day we have a lot of games and we have to keep winning.Southampton, as well, they are better in the table than us and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see on Monday as well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Fellaini, who opened the scoring against Stoke, feels United are starting to gel under Louis van Gaal. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know each other a lot better,\xe2\x80\x9d the Belgian midfielder said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know the manager and the staff so we know the philosophy of the manager. We train hard as well so we have to continue like that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>United host Liverpool at Old Trafford after next week\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Southampton and Chris Smalling is confident they can win both matches. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are in such a good run of form,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have got that belief back.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Smalling is pleased with the way he has recovered after his sending-off in last month\xe2\x80\x99s defeat at Manchester City. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was obviously disappointing,\xe2\x80\x9d the defender said. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt I did quite well in the Chelsea game and then I had the City slip-up. But I felt there was a chance for me to take and I feel like I am really taking that. Hopefully it will continue.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI am feeling good and it is nice to get a little bit of a run. Through quite a lot of my time I have had a good run and then it has stopped for whatever reason. Hopefully I can kick on and just get a good run and cement my place.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
