b'Louis van Gaal: gruelling fixture list deprives fans of attractive games'


b'<p>Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s complaints about the English fixture schedule have continued with him questioning whether the Premier League short-changed supporters over the busy Christmas period and citing what he believes was a clear deterioration in the standard of games.</p> <p>Van Gaal, reflecting on his first five months at Old Trafford, went against the norm to commend Manchester \xe2\x80\x93 the city Carlos Tevez once complained had \xe2\x80\x9conly two restaurants\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 for its choice of culinary delights, expressing unconcealed surprise bearing in mind \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I came to England everybody said the food was not good\xe2\x80\x9d. Yet the United manager is clearly finding the demands on his players less to his taste and was not entirely impressed by how his complaints had been perceived by the Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI read the papers and my colleague, Pochettino, said: \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s the same for everybody\xe2\x80\x99. Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s for everybody. But I have not said anything about my opponents, I have said something about the FA and maybe you can transfer that message better than to provoke my colleagues.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>United\xe2\x80\x99s goalless draw against Tottenham was evidence, according to Van Gaal, that he was right to question a fixture schedule that had seen his team play Newcastle two days earlier. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody knows that a body cannot recover within 48 hours. Therefore, there is a rule at Uefa and Fifa that you cannot play games [in that time]. That\xe2\x80\x99s scientifically proven. Everybody knows that and, in spite of that, we have to play. It\xe2\x80\x99s the culture of England.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind but it is not good for the health of the players and it is not good for the game because I think the FA, and also the fans, want attractive games. You have seen the second half [at Tottenham]. You have seen the second half of Chelsea against Southampton.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Gaal emphasised that last point by clapping his hands in apparent annoyance but he does believe his players will be fully recovered when they play at Stoke City on Thursday. His team have won seven of their last nine league games but his challenge is now for them to take their impressive home form on the road.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe have won every game except Swansea City at home, the first match \xe2\x80\x93 but away, only Arsenal and Southampton, when we were the lucky team. We have to dominate away matches and I hear from Ryan [Giggs] that Stoke City is a very difficult pitch.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Five months in, Van Gaal gives the impression he is enjoying Manchester more than he had expected. \xe2\x80\x9cEnglish life is fantastic because I have met only friendly people on the streets and in the restaurants. The food is fantastic because when I came to England everybody said the food was not good. Also, the wine list is fantastic. I have very nice neighbours; they are all older than me but very nice. I live in a surrounding environment that is fantastic.\xe2\x80\x9d It was some speech, undone only when he was asked about his favourite choice of restaurant and the best food he had encountered. \xe2\x80\x9cChinese,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.</p>'
