b'David Luiz all smiles after Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s friendly win over Colombia'


b'<p>A stunning free-kick in the 83rd minute by the returning Neymar gave a revamped Brazil a 1-0 friendly victory over a fierce Colombia side in a bad-tempered friendly here on Friday. It was retribution of sorts for Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s new captain, making his first start since a broken vertebra against the same opposition curtailed his involvement at the World Cup in brutal fashion.</p> <p>The former Chelsea defender David Luiz, whose tears after Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup exit summed up the nation\xe2\x80\x99s agony, was all smiles following the win. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are starting a new cycle with a new coach and some fresh players, so we are happy,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the Observer.</p> <p>The Paris Saint-Germain defender was glowing in his praise for Neymar, who was once again subjected to some crude Colombian tackling. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought he played so-so,\xe2\x80\x9d he said jokingly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is an amazing player, sometimes the opposition tries to stop him with fouls, but we play in a contact game, so it is only natural. He is very intelligent and day by day he\xe2\x80\x99s getting more mature.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>David Luiz was one of four players who began the 7-1 annihilation by Germany in the World Cup to keep his place against Colombia. One of the new boys was Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Philippe Coutinho, recalled from the international wilderness by the new coach, Dunga, four years after winning his first and only cap.</p> <p>After playing such an influential role in Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s unexpected Premier League title push, the 22-year-old was considered unlucky not to make Luiz Felipe Scolari\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup squad. \xe2\x80\x9cI will look to give my best during practices and I have the opportunity to play more I will give my best,\xe2\x80\x9d he said following a second-half substitute appearance. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is important to win and to start winning. The team played well and with great intensity.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Colombia were hell bent on revenge for the quarter-final defeat to Brazil. They had Juan Cuadrado sent off early in the second half and four other players booked. The Brazilians, and Neymar in particular, stood up to the physical onslaught, but still needed a crucial deflection to survive a last-gasp header from the new Manchester United signing Radamel Falcao.</p>'
