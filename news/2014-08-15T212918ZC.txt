b'Champions League remains the target for Everton and Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez'


b'<p>Optimism was not all that increased around Everton when Romelu Lukaku returned to Goodison Park last month. With one \xc2\xa328m signing comes greater pressure and hopefully an end to those patronising critiques of a plucky unit punching above its weight. Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez does not shirk from the expectancy, he embraces it. This, after all, was his plan.</p> <p>Everton\xe2\x80\x99s manager could point out that it was a transfer budget swelled by players he sold last season, as much as the new broadcasting deal that will help the club reduce their debt, that funded Lukaku\xe2\x80\x99s permanent arrival from Chelsea. He could highlight that it is only one major deal for a player who was on loan at Everton last season and that different financial worlds continue to orbit the upper reaches of the Premier League but that would run contrary to the message Mart\xc3\xadnez has conveyed at Goodison. The aim is the same as it was on day one for the Catalan: the Champions League.</p> <p>Everton recorded their highest points total of the Premier League era under their new manager last season but 72 points proved insufficient for Champions League qualification. Mart\xc3\xadnez believes a top-four finish will be more difficult to achieve this time, has to contend with the extra workload of a Europa League campaign and knows there will be fewer allowances made should he suffer second-season syndrome. There is no complaint. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope there is more expectancy because that is what we want,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be very easy for me to say that it\xe2\x80\x99s not fair to expect us to carry on the level we set last season but that is the expectancy for us, which is why it was very important for us to have continuity in the transfer window. The fresh faces [Mohamed Besic and Christian Atsu] have brought something different and given us real strength in terms of facing different competitions. The target has to be that playing in the Europa League does not mean that we lower our standards in the domestic league.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we carry big expectations but in the same respect the younger players are a year older and I think the squad is stronger and the team is stronger than it was last season due to the experiences we\xe2\x80\x99ve had. It\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be easy and I know our fans have expectations, albeit realistic ones, and I believe we are capable of carrying on where we left off last season.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Lukaku may not start a season of heightened expectation at Leicester City on Saturday as he and Kevin Mirallas were given extended breaks following Belgium\xe2\x80\x99s run to the World Cup quarter-finals. The influential Seamus Coleman is also doubtful with a hamstring injury.</p> <p>Everton did not win in pre-season and Mart\xc3\xadnez does not expect his World Cup contingent to be fully fit for several weeks, though has no concerns over friendly results. \xe2\x80\x9cI tried many things this pre-season and I got a lot of information,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes you go into games in pre-season, score early and you don\xe2\x80\x99t get a lot out of it. Every game this pre-season, for one reason or another, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been able to gather a lot of information. The scorelines obviously weren\xe2\x80\x99t really positive but we weren\xe2\x80\x99t really playing for scorelines otherwise we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have tried the things that we did.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Everton\xe2\x80\x99s points tally last season would have secured a top-four finish in eight of the previous 10 Premier League campaigns but, while believing the margins will be finer, Mart\xc3\xadnez is adamant his team can challenge again. He adds: \xe2\x80\x9cI always felt that anything between 70 and 73 points would secure fourth place and it proved that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the case because there were five Champions League-standard teams in the league and normally you get four. That is what the points reflected. This season it is going to be even harder. Just look at the teams capable of getting points and I think every year the top four is going to be a harder target to achieve.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe Europa League is going to give our season a different look. It is going to be more demanding, a lot of games if you look at September.\xe2\x80\x9d Everton have five matches in 15 days from the 13th to 27th. \xe2\x80\x9cThat gives you a little example of what we are facing and that is going to push everyone to the maximum.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut the aim of getting in the Champions League is always there. That is what we have to do as Everton. We have to look at what we are as a football club and the dream that drives us on is the Champions League. That hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed and will not change.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
