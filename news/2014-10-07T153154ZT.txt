b'MA EFFING BOOKY WOOK 2 <p>The Barcelona to Madrid train line is a wonderful thing. The trains are clean and fresh, in first class they give you wine and a newspaper, and even in the proles\xe2\x80\x99 carriages they put a film on. The Fiver was once on this very train line, in cattle class, when the motion picture I Don\xe2\x80\x99t Know How She Does It was showing. If, like some sort of cinematic philistine you are unfamiliar with this opus, it\xe2\x80\x99s a Sarah Jessica Parker vehicle in which our hero plays a woman with a career, husband, kids and myriad other responsibilities, which she appears to be carrying out with aplomb, but under the surface she\xe2\x80\x99s kicking like the most frantic duck on the pond. She wants it all, but struggles to have it all. Well, we think that\xe2\x80\x99s what it was about \xe2\x80\x93 it was all dubbed in Spanish, so we had to sit there with furrowed brow, peering at the screen as a pensioner would peer at a DVD player\xe2\x80\x99s instructions book. Pierce Brosnan showed up at one point, if that helps.</p> <p>All of which leads us to Roy Keane. As you might be aware, Royston has another book out, his second autobiography in which he catches us up on the last 11 years or so, a time in which he left Manchester United, embarked on his managerial career and became best mates with Adrian Chiles. In the tome, Keano reveals that, just like SJP, he wants it all. \xe2\x80\x9cI have great stability in my life,\xe2\x80\x9d Keano muses. \xe2\x80\x9cBut then, that worries me. I like home comforts, but then I want to be this hell-raiser \xe2\x80\x93 but I want my porridge in the morning. I want my wife and kids around me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve dipped into this madness, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it that much. Maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m like every man on the planet \xe2\x80\x93 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; I want a bit more than what\xe2\x80\x99s on offer.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Don\xe2\x80\x99t we all, Roy? You, SJP, everyone. We just want a bit more. Perhaps in this quest to have more, to have it all, Keane also reveals exactly how much of a winner he is by telling how he beat an entire football club, the mighty Manchester United, after they decided they no longer required his services in 2005. How? By wringing every last bit of use out of his company car, that\xe2\x80\x99s how. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d given back the car. I drove some [effing] miles in that car. Every little victory is vital.\xe2\x80\x9d Winner! Well done Keano! One step closer to having it all! It\xe2\x80\x99s like Dave Brailsford\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98marginal gains\xe2\x80\x99 theory, only astonishingly petty!</p> <p>The book, of course, paints a picture of a man who is basically a walking vat of contradictions. He tells tales of fighting with Peter Schmeichel and wanting to \xe2\x80\x98hurt\xe2\x80\x99 (but not injure, obviously \xe2\x80\x93 that would be silly) Alfie Haaland, but then seems slightly surprised that people are \xe2\x80\x9cexpecting some kind of skinhead thug\xe2\x80\x9d when he walks into a room. He recounts an incident where he exploded at Carlos Queiroz after the mention of the word \xe2\x80\x98loyalty\xe2\x80\x99, but appears to spend much of the book merrily taking swipes at most of the men he used to play with. And he expresses his annoyance at Lord Ferg\xe2\x80\x99s row over some horse \xe2\x80\x98product\xe2\x80\x99, which precipitated the Glazer takeover, but also says it \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t bother us too much\xe2\x80\x9d as he \xe2\x80\x9chad a few shares in the club as part of my contract. So the Glazers coming in was worth a few bob to me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>But then that would only matter if Keane cared about what you thought. Yes, specifically, you. He gives not a single stuff. He may well want it all, but one thing he isn\xe2\x80\x99t that fussed about is being liked. Indeed, he seems to enjoy not being liked. He feeds off the hate: Haaland; admitting to an \xe2\x80\x98evil thought\xe2\x80\x99 about Clive Clarke\xe2\x80\x99s cardiac arrest; taking shots at David Beckham and the rest of the \xe2\x80\x98Class of \xe2\x80\x9892\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 none of these are the acts of a man with a desire to be popular. Of course, the first thing the Fiver will be checking when we get our hands on the book is how Keano dealt with the sad passing of Triggs, the faithful hound who spent hours and miles at his side during the Great Walkies of 2002 when he channeled his World Cup frustration into vigorous canine exercise. Triggs, tragically, went to the great kennel in the sky a couple of years ago, so we\xe2\x80\x99re assuming at least a chapter will be devoted to the mutt\xe2\x80\x99s memory. RIP Triggs.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>29 September: \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone feels it is important there is continuity in the coaching structure \xe2\x80\xa6 In Billy McKinlay, we have someone with the qualities and experience to build further on the foundations already laid for a successful season\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Watford club suit Scott Duxbury welcomes a third manager to the club so far this season.</p> <p>7 October: \xe2\x80\x9cOur job is always to act in the best long-term interests of this football club.

Every week we\xe2\x80\x99re treated to 10% tactics and how managers used their players\xe2\x80\x99 talents to win the game and 90% of the referee\xe2\x80\x99s one borderline decision that even pundits need a couple of views of the replay to be sure about. As far as I can see, the biggest offenders are the supporters of fancy dan clubs, who pile into the British workplace on Monday mornings immediately looking to fault the comparatively poorly-paid official for a split-second decision their cast of multi-million-pound players couldn\xe2\x80\x99t overcome in the other 5,399.75 seconds (plus stoppage time) of the match. How many times have you heard the fans of a big club leaving the ground lamenting that \xe2\x80\x98the ref ruined it\xe2\x80\x99 when in actual fact their astronomical wage bill lacked the nous or instruction to break down a compact unit of second-tier journeymen? We should all admit that most football \xe2\x80\x98fans\xe2\x80\x99 have absolutely no idea what\xe2\x80\x99s unfolding in front of them unless someone \xe2\x80\x98does\xe2\x80\x99 a goal. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be the first to admit the more sophisticated formations and systems are beyond me, and I rely on the musings of Messrs Cox and Wilson to point these out to me with a big stick as much as the next supporter, but please, please, please STOP REF BASHING. Above all else, it\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly boring. Rant over\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Alistair Drummond.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Bits and Bobs. You inform us Thibaut Courtois \xe2\x80\x98social-mediad\xe2\x80\x99 an update on his condition. Now a quick interweb search tells me the word mediad refers to something that is \xe2\x80\x98situated near the median line or plane of an organism\xe2\x80\x99. Are you trying to say Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s No1 was trying to locate the middle of society in his time off? (By time off we obviously include the time he was on the pitch vs Arsenal.) Or is the Fiver struggling to get to grips with Plain Old English again, and just making up words? I suspect it\xe2\x80\x99s the latter. Surely it should be media\xe2\x80\x99d, you know like punk\xe2\x80\x99d.
