b'<p>This was not the way Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho envisaged the Premier League champions playing out the rest of the season and it is a measure of the damage that was done that the repercussions of a chastening night will be felt at the beginning of the next campaign.</p> <p>Two goals from the impressive Saido Berahino \xe2\x80\x93 his 19th and 20th of the season \xe2\x80\x93 and another from Chris Brunt secured a memorable victory for West Bromwich Albion and inflicted Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s heaviest league defeat under Mourinho since 2006. Yet it was the bizarre red card that Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas received in the 30th minute that riled the Portuguese more than anything.</p> <p>Mike Jones, the referee, was dealing with a melee on the other side of the penalty area after Diego Costa had been booked following an off-the-ball altercation with Gareth McAuley, when F\xc3\xa0bregas, stood about 20 yards away, kicked the ball in the direction of a crowd of Albion players and caught Brunt on the side of the head.</p>  <p> Related: Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Ruben Loftus-Cheek hopes for an encore after a difficult audition | Conrad Leach </p>   <p>Darren Fletcher, the Albion captain, reacted furiously and was straying close to the line \xe2\x80\x93 arguably overstepping it \xe2\x80\x93 when he confronted the Spaniard, almost running into him. Jones, on the scene moments later, reached for his back pocket and brandished the red card.</p> <p>The offence will go down as violent conduct and means that F\xc3\xa0bregas, in what was essentially a meaningless game, has picked up a three-match suspension that rules him out of the final fixture of this term, at home against Sunderland, and, much more significantly, the first two matches of next season. The debate about whether the decision was harsh was guaranteed to go on long into the night but whatever the rights and wrongs of the sending off, there is no escaping the fact that it was a stupid thing for F\xc3\xa0bregas to do, especially when the referee was stood so close to Brunt.</p> <p>Mourinho, not surprisingly, took a dim view of the referee\xe2\x80\x99s decision-making and implied that a more experienced official than Jones would have handled it differently and taken a more lenient view.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI would like to see it again because what is this sending off for?\xe2\x80\x9d the Chelsea manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the danger of the situation? Where is the aggressivity in the situation to get a red card in a friendly game almost? I really don\xe2\x80\x99t understand.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think Fletcher was aggressive, yes. He pushes in the chest because he is experienced and he knows where he can push for a yellow card but it\xe2\x80\x99s much more aggressive. What F\xc3\xa0bregas did, for me, a top referee, a stable big personality in control of the game goes there, two or three words, and he\xe2\x80\x99s done. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bizarre red card.\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho suggested that Chelsea have no intention of appealing \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cWe lose all the time, we have a fantastic record on appealing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said sarcastically \xe2\x80\x93 but the Portuguese reacted with disbelief when told of the length of the suspension. \xe2\x80\x9cThree-game ban for this? Jesus Christ. Three-game ban for this? Harsh? Of course it\xe2\x80\x99s harsh, if you get three games with this.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It was that sort of night for Chelsea as Albion followed up their 1-0 win over Manchester United earlier in the month with another highly impressive result. While Mourinho had a point when he suggested that Chelsea would have played better if the title was not already in the bag \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cI think this is a consequence of being champions so early,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in defence of their performance \xe2\x80\x93 Albion deserve credit for the way in which they punished the visitors.</p> <p>Berahino was in the mood from the start and with the transfer window soon to open, chose a good evening to showcase his talent. His first goal, beautifully curled into the far corner from about 22 yards, set Albion on their way after nine minutes and the 21-year-old also won and converted the penalty, after John Terry scythed him down, that doubled their lead two minutes after the restart.</p>     Saido Berahino tucks his penalty past Thibaut Courtois.

Brunt played a short corner with Craig Gardner and from just inside the penalty area, unleashed a powerful shot that seemed to beat Thibaut Courtois for pace as it flew inside his near post.</p> <p>Mourinho gave Isaiah Brown, a former Albion schoolboy, his first senior appearance for Chelsea when he brought him on as a late substitute, but even the sight of \xe2\x80\x98the one that got away\xe2\x80\x99 was not going to ruin the home supporters\xe2\x80\x99 evening. \xe2\x80\x9cIzzy, Izzy, what\xe2\x80\x99s the score?\xe2\x80\x9d chanted the jubilant Albion fans.</p>'
