b'The Fiver | Chocolate-coated health hazards'


b'THE 38th STEP <p>Bad ideas are OK. When the Fiver was but a young slip of a tea-time football pamphlet, it spent the best part of a summer holed up in a garden shed making \xe2\x80\x9cfruit juice\xe2\x80\x9d by dissolving Skittles in water and trying to purvey the resulting product to other children in the street. It proved commercially unsound, as do most ventures that end in tears, withdrawn party invites and rivers of projectile vomit, but no matter. We learned. We wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have a bad idea ever again. And nor will we, from now until we retire from all this to helm up our sideline in chocolate-coated health hazards. We\xe2\x80\x99ll bring that bacon home, of course, much in the manner that Richard $cudamore and the Pr\xc2\xa3mier L\xe2\x82\xacague intends to do through its latest good idea. The way to make a good idea is to change a bad idea very slightly, so it goes, and dropping a few ice cubes into the Skittles cordial that was Game 39 appears to have created the very palatable Kool-Aid that is \xe2\x80\xa6 Game 38. The genius here is that Game 38 is not an extra game. Structural integrity is maintained; everyone gets their glug from the bottle.</p> <p>Groundbreaking stuff, you\xe2\x80\x99ll agree, particularly if your intelligence is not easily insulted by the merest of tweaks to a plan that was run out of town when it was first mooted. While there is a 50% chance that somebody gets their cold footballing experience in Stoke spirited somewhere south, west or east, little other good can come of a scheme that would laugh in the face of old notions of home and away, of partisanship, of having the same opportunity as your opponents to use surroundings to your advantage. Would Burnley like to play their crunch fixture with QPR at a rabid Turf Moor or to a rapt \xe2\x80\x93 why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they be rapt? \xe2\x80\x93 audience in Tokyo? Liverpool v Chelsea, that sounds tasty \xe2\x80\xa6 but even if the nominal hosts were able to walk out in an artfully-chosen venue like, say, Boston, it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly Anfield. No, whichever way you cut this, it\xe2\x80\x99s an egregious distortion of competition and one that, to dilute and present it as the better of two evils as one may, is fundamentally unfair. And 0.01% unfair is as bad as 100% unfair.</p> <p>Perhaps the executives who mull these ideas over, and the head honchos at smaller clubs who flail at the coat-tails of their entirely uncaring wealthier peers, forget that the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s global appeal \xe2\x80\x93 while very far from illusory \xe2\x80\x93 has its limits. You take Crystal Palace on the road, you presuppose that your intended audience has any intention of admiring the merits of Dwight Gayle ahead of players from the Big Four/Five/OK, Six. But pitch two of the top teams against one another in the name of global gluttony and what should be some high-stakes poker becomes horribly skewed.</p> <p>The genie is out though and the answer, of course, is to take the Community Shield \xe2\x80\x93 which clearly means enough given the vigour with which Arsenal fans celebrated their win in August \xe2\x80\x93 on the road each year, perhaps adding to it with another Big Cup contender or two if need be and creating some kind of pre-season Super Cup of distilled superstardom. Hang on \xe2\x80\xa6 If it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s competitive edge, that is because much of that edge lies in the very environment the league is contested in. Remove the \xe2\x80\x9cproduct\xe2\x80\x9d from that environment, and who can guarantee anything? That, in the end, is just the way it is. So if that is progress, then the Fiver is out. But maybe you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t listen to us too closely. If we could just add a few M&amp;Ms to this potion, perhaps the other children would start playing with us again after all.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to miss out on a good opportunity. I know what he has done elsewhere and I want him to work with my players before games. There will be limits \xe2\x80\x93 I am the boss \xe2\x80\x93 and he will not disrupt the technical or physical side. But I accept his role due to the situation the club finds itself in. It\xe2\x80\x99s a desperate situation\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Portuguesa coach V\xc3\xa1gner Benazzi reflects on the Brazilian Serie B club hiring hypnotist Olimar Tesser to help with their battle against relegation. \xe2\x80\x9cIf a player thinks he can bend iron and walk on glass, he can do anything in the game,\xe2\x80\x9d cooed Tesser.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel.

I presume the \xe2\x80\x98marginal games\xe2\x80\x99 to which you refer are a bit like the Hunger Games but worse, given that everyone just has to have margarine instead of butter and that is, basically, worse than being hungry. Or sad. Or being ruthlessly hunted in a dystopian, teen-baiting, future pseudo-America. Or, I suppose, being Aston Villa\xe2\x80\x99s car hire company, worrying about how hard Keano is going to rag his Range Rover Evoque if Paul Lambert looks at him funny. Or \xe2\x80\xa6 um \xe2\x80\xa6 I\xe2\x80\x99m not actually sure where I\xe2\x80\x99m going with this any more. Might have just been simpler to point out you got Dave Brailsford\xe2\x80\x99s big scheme wrong. Ya boo, etc\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Chris Sandford (and 1,056 others).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cShamelessly baiting the 1,057 like that! What you\xe2\x80\x99ve done there, is you\xe2\x80\x99ve done an eggcorn. Here, have some more, courtesy of Adam and Joe\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Robert Young.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s put Roy Keane and Kevin Muscat in a Combi van and send them around the UK. We tell them it\xe2\x80\x99s for a travel series and they\xe2\x80\x99ll be guiding us through the rich history of different regions and the people who live there. But we give them totally contradicting scripts, notes and information on each place in the hope they get angrier and angrier with each other. Like The Trip with less impersonations and way more fists, contorted faces and incoherent rage. Can someone in TV make this happen? Please?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Wade Howland.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in such agreement with Alistair Drummond\xe2\x80\x99s diatribe on ref bashing by fans of highfalutin clubs (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters) that I was moved to click social media\xe2\x80\x99s Like button. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find it. Please can you get one of the Fiver IT drones to embed such a feature. Probably best not to bother with a Dislike button\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Tom Picking.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was driving down the M20 on Monday and noticed a sign by the roadside that simply said: \xe2\x80\x98Stop 24\xe2\x80\x99 [this one? \xe2\x80\x93 Fiver Ed].
