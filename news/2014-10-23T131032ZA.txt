b'A short history of football\xe2\x80\x99s early shirt swapping controversies'


b'<p>Mario Balotelli may have brushed off his shirt-swapping controversy by turning up to training on Thursday in a \xc2\xa3250,000 Ferrarri but rest assurred, the Italian striker received a stern slap on the wrist from his manager Brendan Rodgers. It\xe2\x80\x99s the latest in a long line of Balotelli\xe2\x80\x99s misdemeanours but shirt swapping strife is far from unprecedented. Indeed, it\xe2\x80\x99s not even the first time Rodgers has had to deal with his players getting prematurely shirty \xe2\x80\xa6</p> Mamadou Sakho and Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o            <p>Mamadou Sakho felt Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99s wrath in December last year when the Frenchman swapped shirts with Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o at the half-time interval during the Blues\xe2\x80\x99 2-1 victory at Stamford Bridge. Eto\xe2\x80\x99o had already scored what turned out to be the winner in the 34th minute whereas after the break Sakho could only hit the bar with his header. \xe2\x80\x9cWell one, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that [about the shirt swap], and two, thanks for telling me because I don\xe2\x80\x99t like that,\xe2\x80\x9d said a bemused Rodgers after the match.</p> Ruud van Nistelrooy <p>Balotelli\xe2\x80\x99s trade with Pepe against Anfield on Wednesday prompted Phil Neville, commentating for BBC 5 live, revealed that Ruud van Nistelrooy once received a double dose of hairdryer treatment when he thought it would be a good idea to swap shirts during a Manchester derby. Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s response, according to Neville, was: \xe2\x80\x9cdo that again and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be out of the club\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> Andr\xc3\xa9 Santos and Robin van Persie            <p>Perhaps the most high-profile example, prior to Mario\xe2\x80\x99s, was when Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Andr\xc3\xa9 Santos wanted to get his hands on ex-Gunner Robin van Persie\xe2\x80\x99s shirt at the break during Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 win at Old Trafford in November 2012. Van Persie had taken just three minutes to break the deadlock and Santos, who rarely endeared himself to the Gunners\xe2\x80\x99 faithful, considered the Dutchman\xe2\x80\x99s strip a keepsake he could not resist. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger was not impressed. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t even understand it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Frenchman. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is completely in a different world when he does that.\xe2\x80\x9d Fortunately, Santos\xe2\x80\x99 wife cleared things up. \xe2\x80\x9cThe English should understand better the Brazilian culture before judging someone : no one stops being friends just for changing company,\xe2\x80\x9d she tweeted. After subsequent spells at Gr\xc3\xaamio and Flamengo in Brazil, Santos now plays for FC Goa in the Indian Super League.</p> Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Neymar <p>You\xe2\x80\x99d have thought that judging by Santos\xe2\x80\x99 career path, his Arsenal team-mate Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain would have known better but he could not help himself when up against serial shirt swapper Neymar when on England duty in the Maracana in the summer of 2013. At least Oxlade-Chamberlain waited until after the match to make the transaction but the opening negotiations were clearly picked up on camera with the game still in full flow. Roy Keane, pundit for the match, was typically diplomatic in his assessment. \xe2\x80\x9cRoy Keane hammered me for it,\xe2\x80\x9d confessed the Ox. \xe2\x80\x9cI agree with Roy. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the way to go about things.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Ronaldinho <p>Perhaps Santos\xe2\x80\x99 wife was right, perhaps it is just the thing to do in Brazil. Certainly Ronaldinho has history, once prematurely swapping with the Italian Peter Pan, Francesco Totti, but even he got more than he bargained for in December after Atl\xc3\xa9tico Mineiro had been knocked out of the Fifa Club World Cup by Raja Casablanca. Ronaldinho was mobbed at full-time by players from the Moroccan side, distinctly lacking in sympathy, who managed to secure not only his shirt but his boots.</p> Sergio Ramos and Mesut \xc3\x96zil <p>The Arsenal theme continues in one of the more bizarre instances of shirt swapping, involving Sergio Ramos and Germany\xe2\x80\x99s Mesut \xc3\x96zil during his time at Real Madrid. Hauled off at half-time back in October 2012 with Real already 3-1 to the good against Deportivo, \xc3\x96zil removed his shirt only for Ramos to pounce and put it on underneath his own, seemingly as an act of support for his team-mate but perhaps an act of defiance towards his manager, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho. Real Madrid have history, not least for their group baiting of David Beckham during their remarkable 4-3 defeat, but 6-5 aggregate victory in the 2003 Champions League. \xe2\x80\x9cMadrid\xe2\x80\x99s players were coming up to me and having a chat while the football, this incredible match, was crackling on around us,\xe2\x80\x9d recalls Beckham. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Guti ran alongside me and asked if we could swap shirts at full time. Then, Roberto Carlos was grinning at me again: \xe2\x80\x98Are you coming to play for us?\xe2\x80\x99</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cTen minutes left and it was Zidane\xe2\x80\x99s turn: \xe2\x80\x98David, your shirt?\xe2\x80\x99 I was chasing around still trying to make things happen. They were not trying to distract me or wind me up \xe2\x80\x93 they were just certain that they were going to win all night long.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Oldham Athletic <p>Finally, Oldham deserve a special mention for their act of defiance towards the caretaker manager, Tony Philliskirk, who, due to a \xe2\x80\x9csevere shortage of first-team shirts\xe2\x80\x9d, attached a notice to his team\xe2\x80\x99s dressing room door, making clear that his players were not to swap shirts with their Everton counterparts during their fifth round FA Cup tie. Matt Smith\xe2\x80\x99s 95-minute equaliser ensured that Philliskirk\xe2\x80\x99s orders were disobeyed however. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all got carried away and didn\xe2\x80\x99t really think about the notice,\xe2\x80\x99 said Jose Baxter. \xe2\x80\x9cI just hope we\xe2\x80\x99ve got enough kit for Tuesday.\xe2\x80\x9d Smith, for the record, opted against swapping shirts with any Everton players, instead throwing his into the crowd.</p>'
