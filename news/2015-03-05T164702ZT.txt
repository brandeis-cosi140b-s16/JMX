b'The Fiver | Such brazen unburdening of one of football\xe2\x80\x99s last taboos'


b'GOB ALMIGHTY <p>When The Fiver heard claims that Jonny Evans and Papiss Ciss\xc3\xa9 had swapped spit right in the middle of last night\xe2\x80\x99s Newcastle-Manchester United tryst, we cheered in celebration of such brazen unburdening of one of football\xe2\x80\x99s last taboos. Public defiance of senseless and unnatural strictures liberates us all, as The Fiver often explains after passing wind, so the players\xe2\x80\x99 insouciant exchange was a most welcome development. Then we were informed that we\xe2\x80\x99d misunderstood and there was, in fact, nothing amorous about the suspected exchange between the players. It was, we were told, straight up filth.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere are kids watching, something has to be done!\xe2\x80\x9d squealed Dietmar Hamman on Match of the Day as footage seemed to show liquid hurtling out of each player\xe2\x80\x99s mouth and heading in the direction of the other. It has been suggested that the players were behaving like camels, but pedants pointed out that camels do not spray saliva, they merely burp up semi-digested food and spew that unwholesome pur\xc3\xa9e at suspected aggressors. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not a distinction on which The Fiver cares to dwell: as poor spellers, we have always believed that hare-splitting is the business of vivisectionists.</p> <p>Besides, just as there was talk of a possible ban for the players, it emerged that the images apparently misled and one of the players did not spit at all. At least that is what Evans says and does a man accused of spitting at another in public really strike you as the sort of person who would lie? \xe2\x80\x9cHaving woken up this morning I am shocked to have seen the media coverage from last night\xe2\x80\x99s match,\xe2\x80\x9d barfed Evans. \xe2\x80\x9cI would like to make it clear that I did not spit at Papiss Ciss\xc3\xa9. It is not in my character or in my nature to spit at anybody nor is it something I have ever done or would ever do,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the Manchester United defender, the words streaming from his mouth like cud from a llama\xe2\x80\x99s.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Ciss\xc3\xa9 said sorry, without specifying for what. \xe2\x80\x9cI have apologies to make to a lot of people today,\xe2\x80\x9d he began. \xe2\x80\x9cFirstly to my team-mates and to our supporters, secondly to Jonny Evans, and thirdly to every football fan who saw the incident between myself and Jonny. I reacted to something I found very unpleasant. Sometimes it is hard not to react, particularly in the heat of the moment. I have always tried hard to be positive a role model, especially for our young fans, and yesterday I let you down.\xe2\x80\x9d </p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think that the DBU board is trying to make fools of us players, fans and sponsors. It\xe2\x80\x99s odd that the DBU sent people to negotiations yesterday who cannot negotiate. Most of all, it is a waste of time for all parties\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Wigan\xe2\x80\x99s William Kvist gets his funk on as Denmark\xe2\x80\x99s international players accuse the country\xe2\x80\x99s FA of trying to make them look bad after the latest talks about a new collective bargaining agreement ended in stalemate.

It\xe2\x80\x99s about a chap trying to watch his beloved Nasty Leeds in their 1992 championship season, while having an argument with his girlfriend at the same time. It\xe2\x80\x99s a genuinely good pop song, which I discovered via the John Peel show about 20 years ago\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Adam Kay.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhile reading yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Bits and Bobs about 31 Millwall fans travelling to Middlesbrough, I was reminded of the 1990-91 season. I was working in London and my mate Neil (a Preston fan) convinced me to go to a Monday night game at Craven Cottage, Fulham v Preston. It was the middle of winter, bitterly cold and the away end was roofless. It must have been six below and the wind was whipping in off the Thames. I was well wrapped up and a young lad came over wearing nothing but a short sleeve shirt. \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m f-f-f-f-freezing,\xe2\x80\x99 he stuttered. \xe2\x80\x98Yes. I can see,\xe2\x80\x99 I offered. He went to buy some Bovril and, as I followed his shivering gait to the pie van, I counted 33 Preston fans in the away end. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure many had travelled down, as most were suited. That night Preston lost 1-0 and we sang one song \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x98Yellows, yellows \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 as Preston were playing in yellow. The song was very low in volume, weak and thready. We soon stopped. I looked at my shoes for a bit, feeling all wrong and slightly ashamed. I feel for those 31 Millwall fans, I hope there was Bovril\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Marten Allen.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPatrick Brennan\xe2\x80\x99s emulsions regarding Premier League B teams being fielded in the Johnstone\xe2\x80\x99s Paint Trophy (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s letters) shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be glossed over, though he must surely see the value in stripping down teams to thin out players who can\xe2\x80\x99t perform from their squads. Without looking to brush it aside, there\xe2\x80\x99s no moral turps-itude at stake here and no one should be too concerned as long as there\xe2\x80\x99s a decent finish\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Brendan Dempsey.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs a one-time hipster and musical one-upman, I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to reassure Patrick Brennan that B-sides are always better\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Simon Bell.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
