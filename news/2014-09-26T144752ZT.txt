b'The Fiver: Festering, Simmering Antipathy That Bubbles For Years | Nick Miller'


b'THIS WEEKEND AT THE PREMIER LEAGUE CHUCKLE HUT, FROM ALL THE WAY OVER THERE ... IT\xe2\x80\x99S THE MERSEYSIDE AND NORTH LONDON DERBIES!!! <p>You know what the whole football thing is missing these days? Aggro. Not nearly enough of it around at the moment. We don\xe2\x80\x99t mean Jose Mourinho-style barbs and pointed quips in the media, or a bit of pushing and shoving, or someone saying a few slightly mean things about someone else. Proper aggro. People genuinely disliking each other. Festering, simmering antipathy that bubbles for years and overflows at big moments and inspires a good square go. Roy Keane v Patrick Vieira. Oliver Kahn v Jens Lehmann. Lee Bowyer v Kieron Dyer. Proper beefs.</p> <p>The most reliable place to find such aggro is in local derbies, when the crowd froth themselves into a frenzy of parochial hate, directing the frustrations of a lifetime at the other lot simply because they\xe2\x80\x99re the other lot. Obviously it makes little sense, but that\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so much fun. And hopefully that makes its way to the players, who\xe2\x80\x99ll take on the mantle of ire and give the other lot a good going over \xe2\x80\x93 not necessarily in the physical sense, but in derbies it\xe2\x80\x99s Us v Them, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t just want Us to win, we want Them to be humiliated, spirits crushed, ground into the dirt so they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get up no more.</p> <p>The good news for those of us seeking a little of this aggro is that we have not one, but two big old derbies on Saturday. On Merseyside, Liverpool stick the dukes up and offer Everton outside, while in North London Arsenal will accuse Tottenham of nudging their pint and suggest they settle this with a good old stramash.</p> <p>But the REALLY good news for those of us with nothing else in our pathetic, empty lives to hold our scant attention this weekend is that not only are we potentially looking at a day of four teams slugging it out like Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus, but we could also be looking at four teams capable of the most marvellous slapstick imaginable. As we all know if football can\xe2\x80\x99t be good then it had better be funny, and the four teams involved on Saturday have the potential to make us laugh even harder than you, dear reader, laughs at the Fiver every day. If you can imagine such an outlandish concept. They have already given us plenty of laugh out loud (which is a cumbersome phrase \xe2\x80\x93 if only there was some sort of acronym for it) moments this season, from Mario Balotelli trying so very hard to behave that he looks like he might genuinely pop, to Arsene Wenger trying to convince the world and indeed himself that Abou Diaby is still a footballer and not a life-size doll on which physiotherapists perform experiments.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDiaby is a natural resource,\xe2\x80\x9d said Wenger, and it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to disagree with that as, like natural resources such as coal and gas, anyone relying on Diaby as a long-term solution either has a couple of wires loose or is a fan of leg-pulling and chain-yanking. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I can maintain him without any injuries he will come back and it could be a very satisfying solution for him and us,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, before embarking on a series of risqu\xc3\xa9 \xe2\x80\x98Take my wife\xe2\x80\x99 gags and asking a passing journo to pull his finger. Oh Arsene, you with your constant japing.</p> <p>And there could be so much more. Guffaw! As Liverpool prove wrong those who doubted they could be any worse at defending and turn it into a surrealist art concept. Chortle! When both of Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s full-backs vaporise shortly before half-time. Soil yourself! As the weirdly old-looking Andros Townsend ignores Einstein\xe2\x80\x99s old \xe2\x80\x98definition of insanity\xe2\x80\x99 bon mot by celebrating his 100,000th attempt at the foolproof \xe2\x80\x98cut inside and hoy a shot into the upper tier\xe2\x80\x99 move. Hock up a lung! At the sight of Phil Jagielka realising he\xe2\x80\x99s been wearing his boots on the wrong feet all season, which might explain a few things.</p> <p>Brendan Rodgers, as you might expect, tried to get in on the act as well, but with limited success. \xe2\x80\x9cAt this moment in time we are refocusing and reintroducing the principles into our game that brought the win ratio we\xe2\x80\x99ve had in the last 18 months,\xe2\x80\x9d he guffawed, bellowing \xe2\x80\x9cAMIRITE?\xe2\x80\x9d into the mic before tapping it and asking if \xe2\x80\x9cthis thing is on.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>So here\xe2\x80\x99s hoping for a weekend of high comedy and top-notch aggro. Of laughs and perhaps the odd fight. Of giggles and needle. Beats watching the football, anyway.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I had a very serious disease or even cancer. I had very bad thoughts and was afraid of dying and those thoughts of dying were with me all the time. I was crying for help. I had to get through this and that\xe2\x80\x99s why I went back to Aalborg to feel comfortable in Denmark\xe2\x80\x9d - Aston Villa striker Nicklas Helenius, currently on loan at Aalborg, explains how illness and an accompanying dependence on sleeping pills ruined his first season in the Premier League.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel. Subscribe today! And there\xe2\x80\x99s also a new app for iOS and Android - details of the football offering are here.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems like everyone who reads the Fiver has written a book except me. Fiver readers also spend their time inventing video games, following football and listening to (and quoting) Manic Street Preachers (the rock band, not actual manic street preachers.) One reader even offered to give the clothes off his back [His legs, actually? - Fiver Ed] to whoever wins Letter of the Day. Fiver readers certainly sound like erudite, sociable and friendly folk\xe2\x80\x9d - Dan Davies.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI noticed that people are plugging their own wares in the Fiver as prizes for the letter o\xe2\x80\x99the day. I considered offering a copy of my own book which is a collection of quotes about the benefits of positive thinking and the power of optimism, but then I realised that knowing my luck I would probably win it myself\xe2\x80\x9d - Chris Harrison.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI just wanted to warn you that the offer by Dermot McDermott (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver Letters) to transfer lots of money to the bank accounts of Fiver readers is clearly a con because he has two Ts in his second name and only one in his first. However, my offer of five free downloads of my debut novel King\xe2\x80\x99s Ransom still applies. And what did happen to Helen Tomkins. You know, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d - Martyn Wilson.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cGiven the raft of prizes being offered up by your generous readership can I now be the recipient of the prize that was promised but not forthcoming when I won the dubious award back in the day? To that end are there any readers in the greater New York area that have a mountain bike that they would like to offer up as a prize?\xe2\x80\x9d - David Dein (not that one).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: Man Utd fans having time and money on their hands (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Bits and Bobs). Given their absence from Europe and capitulation against MK Dons, won\xe2\x80\x99t that be most of them? A penny from each of the 659m would get you a hell of a banner and plane from which to trail it\xe2\x80\x9d - Neil Bage.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhilst Michael Hann and 1,056 others may be correct about the writers of Motorcycle Emptiness (Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver Letters) the sentiment still stands regarding credibility with James Dean Bradfield banging on about something of which he had very little experience. See also Madonna and virginity and Steve Claridge and top-flight football\xe2\x80\x9d - Mark Bailie.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSince the Fiver is seemingly encouraging readers to donate prizes in return for publicising their book/gig/video-game, surely it\xe2\x80\x99s a small step to allow us to simply pay you money to get our letters published? I\xe2\x80\x99ve left a pound coin taped to the back of the first rubbish bin to the right as you leave Guardian Towers. Top billing please\xe2\x80\x9d - Charles Antaki. [Bottom billing, because we checked and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there - Fiver Ed]</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@guardian.co.uk. And if you\xe2\x80\x99ve nothing better to do you can also tweet the Fiver. Today\xe2\x80\x99s winner of letter o\xe2\x80\x99the day: David Dein (not that one), who wins five free downloads of Martyn Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s debut novel King\xe2\x80\x99s Ransom, a pair of particularly unflattering second-hand jeans belonging to Fiver Letters correspondent Michael Hunt\xe2\x80\x99s (subject to shipping costs) and a mountain bike (subject to an as yet unidentified generous New York bike donor). </p> JOIN GUARDIAN SOULMATES <p>Chances are that if you\xe2\x80\x99re reading this tea-timely football email, you\xe2\x80\x99re almost certainly single. But fear not - if you\xe2\x80\x99d like to find companionship or love, sign up here to view profiles of the kind of erudite, sociable and friendly folk who would never normally dream of going out with you. And don\xe2\x80\x99t forget, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the rejection that kills you, it\xe2\x80\x99s the hope.</p> BITS AND BOBS <p>Having taken notice of the excellent work done by Guardian Proper Journalists Owen Gibson and David Conn earlier this week, Sepp Blatter has announced that Fifa will ban third party ownership of football players.</p> <p>In other Sepp news, the Fifa president has dismissed that story about the Brazilian FA handing out \xc2\xa316,400 watches as \xe2\x80\x9cnot a story\xe2\x80\x9d and twice side-stepped questions asking him if he has returned his. The gifts were only of \xe2\x80\x9csentimental value\xe2\x80\x9d he said. The Fiver reckons \xc2\xa316,400 buys you a lot of sentiment.</p> <p>Robin van Persie has revealed that the Manchester United players and staff got in a circle, joined hands and talked about their feelings. No, wait, not feelings - their 5-3 defeat to Leicester. They talked about their 5-3 to Leicester.</p> <p>One way to stop that sort of thing happening again might be to bring Cristiano Ronaldo \xe2\x80\x98home\xe2\x80\x99, but United have been crunching the numbers and that will cost them the thick end of \xc2\xa3140million.</p> <p>Arsene Wenger has offered some friendly advice to Spurs, and told them their current home is a skanky doss-hole and they need some new digs. Something like that, anyway.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x98Helpless, helpless heeeeelpless,\xe2\x80\x99 sang Neil Young a few years back, and Jose Mourinho knows how he feels, saying he has no control over whether the twangy hamstrings of Diego Costa get called up for the Spain squad.</p> <p>The last time Everton beat Liverpool at Anfield in the league, Eiffel 65 topped the charts with the seminal \xe2\x80\x98Blue (Da Ba Bee)\xe2\x80\x99. Roberto Martinez reckons they can change that this weekend. The winning thing, not that song you\xe2\x80\x99re now humming.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x98ARGH, MY GROIN!\xe2\x80\x99 said Samir Nasri, after being ruled out of Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Hull on Saturday with knack.</p> <p>You thought Frankie Lampard\xe2\x80\x99s celebration after scoring against Chelsea at Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s place was muted? Wait until he does the same at Stamford Bridge, which could happen if he extends his loan spell at City in January. Which he could.</p> <p>And Russell Slade\xe2\x80\x99s appointment as Cardiff City manager has been put on hold amid wrangling, it says here.</p> STILL WANT MORE? <p>Our crack video team bring you everything you ever needed to know about Everton FC, told by the fans for the fans. There\xe2\x80\x99s a Liverpool equivalent ahoy! Enjoy the Merseyside Derby!</p> <p>The gangplank is lowered so that Jacob Steinberg and Barry Glendenning can skip merrily aboard the showboat for The Joy of Six: backheel brilliance.</p> <p>In an extract from his bookie wook In Search of Duncan Ferguson, Alan Pattullo recalls the Everton legend\xe2\x80\x99s meticulous preparation for his first Merseyside derby, which involved going on the lash, getting arrested on suspicion of drink-driving, making a new lady friend and spending a night in the cells courtesy of the local bizzies.</p> <p>Conrad Leach and Paul Doyle will be looking out for things throughout the weekend\xe2\x80\x99s programme of Premier League action. Here are 10 of them.</p> <p>West Ham striker Enner Valencia used to milk cows to make ends meet, now he\xe2\x80\x99s suckling at the metaphorical teat of Big Sam Allardyce at West Ham. Jacob Steinberg finds out he\xe2\x80\x99s getting on.</p> <p>Assorted nerds masquerading as European football experts preview the weekend\xe2\x80\x99s continental action in our lovingly crafted football video previews.</p> <p>Barney Ronay writes 900 words in praise of \xe2\x80\x9cthe enduring, self-made, neck-flaring wonder of the modern age\xe2\x80\x9d that is Cristiano Ronaldo, concentratingly specifically on the Portuguese\xe2\x80\x99s neck.</p> <p>And in Not Football news, Scott \xe2\x80\x9cBrassy Niblick\xe2\x80\x9d Murray has been up since the crack of dawn watching golf, writing about golf and wondering why Rory McIlroy\xe2\x80\x99s been wandering around Gleneagles wearing a pair of oven gloves in his Ryder Cup hole-by-hole report.</p> SIGN UP TO THE FIVER <p>Want your very own copy of our free tea-timely(ish) email sent direct to your inbox?
