b'Adam Lallana believes Liverpool have found system to turn things around'


b'<p>There are times when game plans, philosophies and long-term aspirations take a back seat and, as Adam Lallana puts it, \xe2\x80\x9cyou just have to show a bit of bottle\xe2\x80\x9d. That time is now for Liverpool and, for all the justified criticism of Brendan Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 team, bottle has helped alleviate the growing sense of crisis at Anfield. A trip to Burnley demands more.</p> <p>It would be premature in the extreme to suggest Liverpool, top of the Premier League last Christmas and 10th one year on, are a convincing unit once again, despite their manager\xe2\x80\x99s talk of a top-four challenge after the 2-2 draw with Arsenal on Sunday. Equally it would be churlish to ignore the character of a side that began a defining period with a Champions League exit and a 3-0 defeat at Manchester United, then moved into the Capital One Cup semi-final and dominated Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s possession-based team at Anfield. Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s character has been questioned this season, often rightly so, and a riposte has belatedly arrived.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re causing teams problems again and we can gain belief from that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lallana. \xe2\x80\x9cThe lads were lacking a bit of confidence, not just myself, a few of us. That comes with disappointing results but you have these points in your career when you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to show a bit of bottle, where you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go looking for the ball. We\xe2\x80\x99ve done that. It\xe2\x80\x99s maybe easy to hide when you\xe2\x80\x99re not playing well and results aren\xe2\x80\x99t going well but that\xe2\x80\x99s when you have to work through it because eventually it will click. We all have bad days at work and it\xe2\x80\x99s about how you bounce back and how hard you work.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Christmas provides opportunity for Liverpool to give substance to Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 top-four hopes with home games against Swansea City and bottom-of-the-table Leicester City following the visit to third-from-bottom Burnley. The team has made tentative but important steps forward since Rodgers reverted to a 3-4-2-1 formation that has enabled Lallana and Philippe Coutinho to exert a greater influence. The system is not all that has changed, however, with the Liverpool manager adopting more of a siege mentality in a bristling response to his critics.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think the manager has been fantastic with the whole group but I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99s found it difficult as well,\xe2\x80\x9d admits the England international. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t always ignore what people write and what people say. Eventually it gets out there. But it\xe2\x80\x99s about sticking together. That\xe2\x80\x99s what he\xe2\x80\x99s mentioned \xe2\x80\x93 that we all stick together no matter how many different people have their opinions and want us not to do well just because we\xe2\x80\x99re not fighting for the league title like last year. There are reasons for that. People might not like the reasons but there are reasons and it\xe2\x80\x99s up to us, step by step, to get back to where the lads were last year.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been impressed by the way the manager has been looking for different solutions to try and make it work. He\xe2\x80\x99s looking for the system to suit the personnel we\xe2\x80\x99ve got and over the last couple of games I think we\xe2\x80\x99ve found it and that\xe2\x80\x99s credit to him. It\xe2\x80\x99s not the only system we can play but it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of just clicked with Raheem [Sterling] playing a great role for us. It\xe2\x80\x99s not his natural role but he\xe2\x80\x99s been doing really well for the team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>So, too, has Lallana. The \xc2\xa325m summer signing from Southampton had a frustrating start to his Liverpool career with injury followed by a spell on the bench. Rodgers explained that demotion was purely tactical, claiming he needed more pace behind Rickie Lambert when the centre-forward was leading the line, but the 26-year-old accepts the responsibility.</p> <p>The midfielder explained: \xe2\x80\x9cI never thought it was going to be easy coming to a club as big as this. Maybe parts of me wanted to do too well and I was trying too hard \xe2\x80\x93 just a combination of little things really, settling into playing at such a big club and so on. But I\xe2\x80\x99m getting there. I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling more relaxed and a relaxed Adam Lallana on the pitch is when I\xe2\x80\x99m at my best. I\xe2\x80\x99m gradually feeling that and I\xe2\x80\x99m gradually feeling myself more and more.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s important we take things game by game. We\xe2\x80\x99re in the semi-finals of a cup competition [against Chelsea next month]and, for someone like me who came in from a great club like Southampton to Liverpool, I wanted to push on and win silverware and straight away we\xe2\x80\x99re in the semis. I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait for that. People say it\xe2\x80\x99s only the Capital One Cup but it\xe2\x80\x99s a great competition. We\xe2\x80\x99ve also got a good run of games coming up in the league where, if we put in performances like we did against Arsenal, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a strong chance of moving up the table.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
