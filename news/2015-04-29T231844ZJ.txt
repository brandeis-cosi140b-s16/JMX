b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho praised his \xe2\x80\x9cphenomenal\xe2\x80\x9d players after a half-time team-talk with \xe2\x80\x9ctoo many peeps\xe2\x80\x9d inspired Chelsea to a victory at Leicester City that leaves them on the brink of claiming their first Premier League title in five years.</p> <p>Despite trailing to Marc Albrighton\xe2\x80\x99s first-half goal, Chelsea moved 13 points clear at the top of the table after Didier Drogba, John Terry and Ramires scored after the interval to leave Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side needing a win against Crystal Palace on Sunday to be crowned champions.</p> <p>The Chelsea manager warned the club\xe2\x80\x99s supporters against any complacency before Palace\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Stamford Bridge, but the title is now within touching distance and Mourinho was full of praise for the way his players have \xe2\x80\x9cdestroyed opponents\xe2\x80\x9d in the month of April, when he sensed that others were expecting the team to falter.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic because I know April is the month where everybody was waiting for Chelsea to slip, was waiting for Chelsea to lose points, lose one game, lose and draw, take this title race to the last couple of matches,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut it was exactly in this month \xe2\x80\x93 a month with problems, a month without Diego Costa, without Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my, with Drogba and Oscar playing striker, no other solutions, just this small group of players we have \xe2\x80\x93 where we were phenomenal.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe were tactically phenomenal, team spirit, the team ethic, the way we defended, the way we were clinical with our goals, the stability we showed in every game. Everyone expected us to drop points against Arsenal and Manchester United but April was the month that we destroyed opponents. We won every game except the draw against Arsenal, so I\xe2\x80\x99m very pleased. Now we just need three more points.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Asked whether he could almost touch the Premier League trophy, Mourinho said: \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, but I cannot touch, we need to win. So I would say we need three points to be completely safe. But I think we all had in our minds to try and do it at Stamford Bridge. I think today the great motivation was exactly that, to bring the title to Stamford Bridge, which we were able to do.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut I think Stamford Bridge \xe2\x80\xa6 they can\xe2\x80\x99t celebrate yet. If they want to celebrate, they have to celebrate the Capital One Cup. On Sunday I hope they go there not to celebrate, I hope they go there to play the match with us, to push the team. That is the spirit we have in our camp.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe boys in the dressing room are happy not because they won the title, they\xe2\x80\x99re happy because they won one more game and because they are one step closer. But that must be the spirit for Sunday. People have to walk to Stamford Bridge not celebrating the title, people have to walk ready to play against Crystal Palace.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>This was an evening when Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s old guard once again demonstrated their worth. Petr Cech, making a rare start, produced a superb save to deny Paul Konchesky shortly before Albrighton gave Leicester the lead in first-half injury-time, while Drogba and Terry got the goals that turned the match in Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s favour in the second half before Ramires added a glorious third.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe old and the young,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said. \xe2\x80\x9cPetr Cech, great performance, John, Didier, Branislav [Ivanovic], but other giants on the pitch \xe2\x80\x93 Nemanja Matic, Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas, Ramires. A great team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Terry admitted that Mourinho gave the players a \xe2\x80\x9ctelling off at half-time\xe2\x80\x9d following an opening 45 minutes in which Chelsea struggled to play with any fluency and failed to register a shot on target, but the Portuguese declined to go into detail about what he said in the dressing room. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I tell you on television what I said it will be \xe2\x80\x98peep, peep, peep\xe2\x80\x99. Too many peeps.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In the end there was no shortage of entertainment on a night when the travelling supporters embraced the criticism of their team\xe2\x80\x99s style of play by sarcastically chanting \xe2\x80\x9cBoring, boring Chelsea\xe2\x80\x9d in the second half.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cTonight was not boring for me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be losing at half-time is not boring \xe2\x80\x93 it is pressure. The way we played in the second half, against probably the best team we have played in the last month, was fantastic.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a difficult first half, a very good team, very well organised defensively, pressing very well, closing spaces, very aggressive in the way they play with the ball. In the first half they were a team defending well, trying to score a goal on the counterattack, which they did.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn the second half, obviously, the early goal is important but after that we were completely in control. We played so, so well and so fluid, and the goal had to arrive sooner or late. So I think the boys did fantastic.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
