b'Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Manuel Pellegrini brushes off talk about job security'


b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini claims that he has no concerns over his position as Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s manager, despite them being knocked out at the last-16 stage of the Champions League by Barcelona for a second successive season.</p> <p>Ivan Rakitic\xe2\x80\x99s 31st-minute goal gave Luis Enrique\xe2\x80\x99s team a 1-0 victory in the second leg and a 3-1 win on aggregate. The Premier League champions became the fourth and final English club to drop out of this season\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League but the wider concern for their manager is his own future, given City\xe2\x80\x99s defence of their domestic title is also faltering, with them six points behind Chelsea having played a game more than the London club.</p> <p>Pellegrini has consistently talked of the need for City to progress as a club and so the pressure on him has intensified in recent weeks, and even more so following their showing against Bar\xc3\xa7a across two legs, with the visitors especially overawed here, in particular during the first half, during which Lionel Messi set up Rakitic\xe2\x80\x99s goal with an exquisite pass to cap an awesome individual display.</p>     Manuel Pellegrini would not be drawn on whether his Manchester City squad requires wholesale changes following the Champions League exit at the hands of Barcelona. Photograph: Dougie Allward/JMP/Rex    <p>Asked if he could be 100% sure of still being City\xe2\x80\x99s manager next season, Pellegrini replied: \xe2\x80\x9cAt the end of the season we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what we analyse [and what] is the future but I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any problems or am worried about that. Maybe it is not the moment to try to explain different things. It\xe2\x80\x99s very important for this team to try to win something every year. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is absolutely necessary to think that you [have to] improve because there are a lot of things that you must analyse in the right moment. I repeat, last season was a very good season.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In his defence, the Chilean pointed to financial fair play penalties that have limited City to a net \xc2\xa349m transfer spend this season, which rather overlooks the fact the club have spent close to \xc2\xa3170m on players in the past two years. \xe2\x80\x9cThis year we have just some important restrictions especially to bring important players, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t reinforce our squad so good as much as other teams,\xe2\x80\x9d said the manager.</p>           Barcelona should have scored more goals against Manchester City, says Luis Enrique.    <p>On the continuing speculation about his job, Pellegrini added: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a distraction,\xe2\x80\x9d and would not be drawn on whether the squad requires wholesale changes. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will see about that in the right moment. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see it as a failure \xe2\x80\x93 it is a disappointment but we have reached the last 16 twice,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were unlucky to play Bar\xc3\xa7a on both occasions \xe2\x80\x93 we have had a big restriction on our squad size and money, but we have to admit Bar\xc3\xa7a were a better team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Joe Hart, who was City\xe2\x80\x99s undoubted best performer here and arguably produced his best performance for the club, gave his backing to Pellegrini. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s always going to be the same at City, for all the players. We appreciate that if we don\xe2\x80\x99t win everyone will be speculated about. You have to be strong inside,\xe2\x80\x9d said the goalkeeper. \xe2\x80\x9cWe back our manager. He is a great manager and brought us two trophies last year. Now we have nine [league] games to win \xe2\x80\x93 and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we hope to do.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMake no bones about it, Barcelona were the better team in both legs but we hung on in there, defended and made saves, and made tackles, but then didn\xe2\x80\x99t take our chance to get back into it. We have to learn to take our chances. Sometimes in Europe you won\xe2\x80\x99t be the better team and you have to somehow find a way to win.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
