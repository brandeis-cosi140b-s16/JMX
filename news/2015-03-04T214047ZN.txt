b'<p>Abeid has a wild whack from 25 yards in a futile attempt to make up for that awful late comedy of errors. But that\xe2\x80\x99s that! Manchester United were the better team, and deserved the win, though they made heavy weather of it and left it late. And fourth place is still very much theirs, the bid for a Champions League place still on track!
