b'THE CLOY OF CESC? <p>As Arsenal prepare for their winner-takes-all encounter with Chelsea (that is, it\xe2\x80\x99s not a winner-only-takes-a-bit encounter, though we\xe2\x80\x99re not sure what one of those is. There are definitely encounters in which teams draw and take a bit each, and this is potentially one of those, but if there is a winner they will definitely take it all \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x98it\xe2\x80\x99 being the maximum available point-haul \xe2\x80\x93 which is the point we were making), the world\xe2\x80\x99s attention turned upon Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas, because he used to play for one team and now plays for the other.</p> <p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger today explained why he didn\xe2\x80\x99t snap the midfielder up when he left Barcelona and headed to Stamford Bridge in the summer. \xe2\x80\x9cI personally believe that deal was done a long time ago, early 2014,\xe2\x80\x9d he revealed. \xe2\x80\x9cI was informed that he might go to Chelsea, but when I was informed I thought the deal was already done. As long as we are not in contention, we cannot stop people going where they want.\xe2\x80\x9d In other words, he might well have wanted to sign the player but didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the opportunity.</p> <p>But then Wenger continued. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was not a subject for us. We were in search of more up front and more defensive opportunities than creative midfielders. We have many. It makes sense if you look at the balance of the team. I think that was a decision that is easy to understand.\xe2\x80\x9d In other words, he might well have had the opportunity to sign the player but didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to. So which is it? Not for the first time when it comes to Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s transfer policy, we\xe2\x80\x99re all scratching our heads. When it comes to convincingly explaining why he didn\xe2\x80\x99t sign F\xc3\xa0bregas this summer without appearing to contradict himself moments later, it must be said that Wenger is a specialist in failure.</p> <p>Which, as it happens, is precisely what Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho called him back in February, shortly before the Gunners headed to west London and got tonked by six goals to none. That result leaves Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s record against the Portuguese polymath standing at played 11, won 0, drawn 5, lost 6 (the last six matches in the head-to-head have, from an Arsenal perspective, been drawn-lost-drawn-lost-drawn-lost, so put your house \xe2\x80\x93 yours, not the Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s, you understand, we like our pavement \xe2\x80\x93 on a Sunday stalemate). Whether F\xc3\xa0bregas\xe2\x80\x99s move should go down as another defeat in that run is something that, well, we\xe2\x80\x99re all still a bit confused about.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got some CV and experience that says I can do that and I can turn around this situation. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to lean on that. Nobody else is going to lean on it so it\xe2\x80\x99s important that I do. So I will go home and shine my manager of the year trophy to give myself a bit of confidence and come in tomorrow\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 you\xe2\x80\x99re going to miss Alan Pardew when he\xe2\x80\x99s gone.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel.

I managed to watch for 12 minutes and 19 seconds before losing the will to live and stopping it. My therapist assures me that this is a perfectly normal reaction. Two things occur to me. Firstly, what kind of deranged individual trawls through every Nicolas Cage movie and distils the bits where he\xe2\x80\x99s laughing, then stitches them all together and puts them on YouTube? Secondly, what kind of deranged individual actually finds said video and provides a link. And thirdly, did any of your readers actually make it to the end of the video, sanity intact? I\xe2\x80\x99m betting on none. If any of them did manage to watch all of it, I suggest you delete them from you distribution list as they are almost certainly psychopaths (if not before watching the video, then surely subsequently) and they know where you live. God knows what I\xe2\x80\x99ll be dreaming about tonight\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Phil Unsworth.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: Bake-Off Big Cup (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters).

But you don\xe2\x80\x99t see anything like that in Brazil, where they cover the national team 24 hours a day.</p> <p>And West Ham have ordered defender James Tomkins to carry out extra community work after he was found guilty of assaulting a police officer and being drunk and disorderly outside a trendy Essex nightspot. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t take kindly to a lack of discipline off the field at all,\xe2\x80\x9d seethed Sam Allardyce. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s irresponsible, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s unacceptable.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> RECOMMENDED VIEWING         Weekend Bundesliga preview    <p>More European football previews than you can shake a stick at.

Sure, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the end of the world, but neither is a kick in the nuts and it\xe2\x80\x99s still a sensation nobody enjoys.\xe2\x80\x9d Arsenal fan Andrew Mangan (@Ar$eblog) lets it all out as he mentally prepares to watch Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas in Chelsea blue.</p> <p>Meanwhile, tongue-twisting\xe2\x80\x99s Barney Ronay reflects that, despite having played for his home club and his home-from-home club, F\xc3\xa0bregas looks entirely at home at new home Chelsea.</p> <p>Who has taken 20 shots this season without scoring a single goal?
