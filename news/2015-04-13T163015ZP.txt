b'Paddy Power provokes outrage with African American beatings tweet'


b'<p>The bookmaker Paddy Power has again courted controversy with a tweet before Monday night\xe2\x80\x99s meeting between Newcastle and Liverpool at Anfield. The words \xe2\x80\x9cNewcastle have suffered more Kop beatings over the last 20 years than an unarmed African-American male\xe2\x80\x9d are accompanied by a picture of the Liverpool manager, Brendan Rodgers, resulting in a furious backlash on Twitter from users.</p>    <p>Newcastle have suffered more Kop beatings over the last 20 years than an unarmed African-American male. The stats: http://t.co/GOOdyAszNo</p>&mdash; Paddy Power Offers (@PPOffers) April 13, 2015    <p>While many have labelled the ads racist, others have just seen it as the latest wilfully offensive publicity campaign by the bookmaker.</p>    <p>Ah, I see Paddy Power are branching out into that &quot;racist police brutality banter&quot; market.</p>&mdash; Chris No (@nathizzle) April 13, 2015      <p>I reckon Nick Griffin runs Paddy Power you know, that Cameroon advert doing the rounds on TV is subtly racist as well</p>&mdash; Danny Maiorca (@Maiorca_) April 13, 2015      <p>Have Paddy Power just jumped the shark with that Tweet? Can&#39;t see how it&#39;s racist - it&#39;s not. Offensive to the masses and misguided though</p>&mdash; Mark Robinson (@MrMCRobinson) April 13, 2015    <p>The tweet follows on from a succession of stories in the US regarding police shootings of African Americans. It is also the latest in a long line of Paddy Power campaigns that have provoked a backlash from the public. There was the offer of \xe2\x80\x9cmoney off if he walks\xe2\x80\x9d  during the Oscar Pistorius trial, a 2010 commercial showing a blind footballer kicking a cat into a tree and a recent offer to Chelsea fans on the way to the Capital One Cup final to \xe2\x80\x9cprove you\xe2\x80\x99re not prejudiced\xe2\x80\x9d by posing with a selection of disabled and black and minority ethnic actors.</p>    <p>Credit to Paddy Power. Seeing police brutality against African-Americans as a marketing opportunity takes some real vision.</p>&mdash; Andy Gilderdale (@AndyGilder) April 13, 2015  '
