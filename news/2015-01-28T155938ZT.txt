b'HEAD PIG <p>Throw a pig\xe2\x80\x99s head at Sepp Blatter and he\xe2\x80\x99d no doubt think it is the first course in another epic Fifa swankfest, one followed by swordfish fricass\xc3\xa9, truffled wildebeest and sevruga caviar on a bed of handmade penne and lashed servants. Throw a swine\xe2\x80\x99s bonce at Luis Figo, however, and he\xe2\x80\x99d immediately recall the gruesome way that Barcelona greeted him when he returned to Camp Nou with Real Madrid back in the day. Figo, you see, used to be a gifted and enormously popular and unpopular footballer, and that is pretty much all the Fiver knows about him. Yet we still reckon he would have more legitimacy as Fifa boss than Herr Blatter.</p> <p>Funny we should mention that actually, because since we wrote those opening lines over last night\xe2\x80\x99s kebab this morning, Figo has only gone and declared his candidacy for the upcoming Fifa presidential elections!</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf you search Fifa on the internet you see the first word that comes out: scandal,\xe2\x80\x9d tut-tutted Figo while explaining his reasons for putting himself forward. The Fiver checked out his claim and it turns out that if you search Fifa on the internet, the first word that comes out now is \xe2\x80\x98Figo\xe2\x80\x99, so it seems the Portuguese is already cleaning up the world governing body\xe2\x80\x99s image! It\xe2\x80\x99s an auspicious start and no mistake, and what\xe2\x80\x99s more Figo\xe2\x80\x99s bid isn\xe2\x80\x99t even being bankrolled by bookies and simpletons. Hear that David Ginola, you silly stunt?</p> <p>In fact, Figo says he has been given the backing of at least five national associations, meaning that he, unlike Le Magnifique and, indeed, J\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xb4me Champagne, already meets the minimum criteria for being allowed to try to challenge Blatter. So that\xe2\x80\x99s Figo, Prince Ali of Jordan and the Dutch FA\xe2\x80\x99s prize tulip, Michael van Praag, who seem ready to jump into Reliant Robins to race against the Blatter mobile. \xe2\x80\x9cLast year was the World Cup, I was in Brazil and I saw the reaction of all the fans regarding the image of Fifa and I think something has to be changed,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Figo, before declaring that the controversy over Fifa\xe2\x80\x99s decision to obscure the findings of Michael Garcia\xe2\x80\x99s report into the bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup was another factor in his decision to run. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter that report was not published I think that was the moment of change and the moment I thought that something had to be done,\xe2\x80\x9d Figo trilled. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are transparent and if you ask for an investigation, a report, which you have nothing to hide, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you make public that report? It is not a good decision.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Fiver takes its dunce\xe2\x80\x99s hat off to anyone with integrity who stands up to Blatter, and sincerely hopes that Figo belongs in that category. Something tells us that someone somewhere is going to be doing their utmost to dig up muck on him right now.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Barry Glendenning for Sheffield United 1-2 Tottenham (agg: 1-3) at 7.45pm GMT, and keep Paul Doyle company for Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid 1-1 Barcelona at 8pm GMT.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not insensitive to the current situation in Qatar because there are social and political issues there that didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist in 2010 and we\xe2\x80\x99re sensitive to them\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Barcelona consider dropping the Qatar Foundation over ethical concerns.</p> <p>Previous Bar\xc3\xa7a ethical stances:</p> <p>2004: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re talking about small boys. This crosses the line of all ethics and morals\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Bayer Leverkusen are concerned when Barcelona sign 12-year old Denni Krol.</p> <p>2005: \xe2\x80\x9cNext they\xe2\x80\x99ll be taking toddlers.

Since it normally takes at least 30 seconds, following a goal (and that would be quick) for the ball to be returned to the centre circle following the obligatory celebration and the slow trot back to face the kick-off, it would be nigh on impossible for Chelsea to be leading 1251-0 (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s fiver). Even allowing for a generous 10 minutes of additional time, each goal would have to be scored in less than 4.8 seconds. Even allowing for the fact that the celebrations might tail off somewhat after the 100th goal that would be going some\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 John Myles.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIgnore the previous one. This is phrased better. You asked for it! Since it probably takes at least 30 seconds, following a goal (and that would be quick) for the ball to be returned to the centre circle, following the obligatory celebration and the slow trot back to face the kick off, it would be nigh on impossible for Chelsea to be leading 1251-0 (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s fiver). If we add a generous 10 minutes of additional time, each goal would have to be scored in less than 4.8 seconds. Even allowing for the fact that the celebrations might tail off somewhat after the 100th goal that would be going some\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 John Myles.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMay one enquire as to why have you discontinued the \xe2\x80\x98Bigger Plug than BFG\xe2\x80\x99s Bath\xe2\x80\x99 segment? Please don\xe2\x80\x99t throw the plug out with the bathwater. Or have you already yanked the chain? Kindly advise the great unwashed\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Jaime Abrahamse.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI must confess that I am becoming concerned about the health and wellbeing of the down trodden epitome of woe that is the Fiver. First it claims to have trouble dialling a telephone (Fiver, passim) and today it claims to be washing its teeth with chocolate milk. The resemblances to a certain Homer Simpson in Fat Man Homer are becoming alarming.
