b'West Ham are taking a big gamble by getting rid of Big Sam | Jacob Steinberg'


b'<p>Four years ago, when David Sullivan and David Gold surveyed the wreckage left by Avram Grant and wondered how on earth they were going to rectify the situation, West Ham United\xe2\x80\x99s owners decided that the only remedy was to prescribe an emergency course of Sam Allardyce. West Ham had just vomited their way into the Championship after finishing bottom of the Premier League and they were hardly in a position to be sniffy. They had to take their medicine.</p> <p>It is fair to say that Allardyce was not exactly welcomed with open arms. There were suspicious nods and inquisitive stares, respectful applause rather than scenes of jubilation when he was presented to West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s supporters at the start of the 2011-12 season.</p> <p>The overriding feeling was that Allardyce represented the exact opposite of West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s core values. The \xe2\x80\x9cWest Ham Way\xe2\x80\x9d matters. Allardyce cupped his ear in disbelief last year when the crowd booed at the end of a victory over Hull City that pushed new boundaries on the boredom spectrum and his perceived lack of appreciation for the club\xe2\x80\x99s history is why many fans will not be sorry that the board has not offered him a new contract. Slaven Bilic, a former West Ham defender who is leaving Besiktas after doing well in Turkey, is the early frontrunner.</p> <p>Yet only the most blinkered of Allardyce\xe2\x80\x99s critics could argue that he has not nursed West Ham back to health. They were promoted via the play-offs in his first season and have finished comfortably in mid-table in the past three seasons. People have short memories. West Ham are unrecognisable now from the flimsy, beige pushovers that Allardyce inherited.</p> <p>Allardyce was almost sacked last summer after a difficult season in which his attack was blunted by Andy Carroll\xe2\x80\x99s foot injury and at Christmas it was looking like a wise move to grant him a reprieve. The complaints about the negativity of his football were forgotten when West Ham, transformed by the signings of Aaron Cresswell, Cheikhou Kouyat\xc3\xa9, Carl Jenkinson, Diafra Sakho, Alex Song and Enner Valencia, recorded impressive wins over Liverpool and Manchester City in the autumn. Better players, better football.</p> <p>Carroll and Kevin Nolan, two Allardyce favourites, were missing at the start of the season and that forced a tactical readjustment. Allardyce hit on a diamond formation that allowed the full-backs, Cresswell and Jenkinson, to push forward. Song was inspired and Stewart Downing flourished at the tip of the diamond. Sakho and Valencia terrorised opposition defences with their pace and skill.</p>           Sam Allardyce comments on his time at the club and his plans now that he has been let go    <p>West Ham were unlikely Champions League contenders. Could they last the pace? It was a test of Allardyce\xe2\x80\x99s managerial acumen, especially when Carroll and Nolan returned and the side\xe2\x80\x99s flow dropped just enough for it to be noticeable even when they won, and he was accused of losing his nerve at Chelsea on Boxing Day. Sakho and Song were on the bench, the formation was 4-5-1 and West Ham were meek in a 2-0 defeat. Momentum stalled.</p> <p>The slide down to 12th place has counted against Allardyce, although it is clear that they need a bigger squad. Their only signings in January were the Canadian defender Doneil Henry, who succumbed to injury during a loan spell at Blackburn, and a 33-year-old Brazilian, Nen\xc3\xaa, who was playing in Qatar. Injuries weighed heavily. Carroll has not played since February and Sakho and Valencia have started together only seven times since the win over City. Sakho, West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s top scorer, missed the final month of the season with a thigh injury.</p> <p>Expectations skyrocketed when West Ham flew into the top four. Allardyce, though, was not getting carried away. \xe2\x80\x9cSustainable progress is what it\xe2\x80\x99s all about,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in October. He spoke about building gradually and how he wanted West Ham to emulate Everton.</p> <p>Yet the absence of important players does not entirely absolve Allardyce of blame for West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s dip. There has also been a sense of him retreating into his tactical shell since the turn of the year. The diamond system has been used less and with Song badly out of form, West Ham have beaten only Burnley, Hull City and Sunderland in the league in 2015.</p> <p>Equally, however, it must be pointed out that the analysis of West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s season would be kinder if they had not conceded last-minute equalisers against Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur in February or if they had not lost narrowly to Chelsea in March.</p> <p>However, this leads us back to the debate over Allardyce\xe2\x80\x99s approach. West Ham have dropped 13 points from winning positions in 2015 and that cannot just be down to bad luck. It hints at something deeper. They are capable of taking the lead with good, forceful attacking but if the cushion of a second goal has not arrived by a certain point, West Ham retreat and invite pressure. They are too willing to relinquish the initiative.</p> <p>The question now that the axe has fallen is whether the healing process that began in 2011 is over. Doctors tell you to finish a course of antibiotics, even if you feel better. Otherwise symptoms return. There is a fear that Allardyce\xe2\x80\x99s exit will have similar consequences.</p> <p>Admittedly, that is more of a hunch than a scientific theory. It could turn out that West Ham are right to gamble, that this is the time to upgrade. They move into the Olympic Stadium in the summer of 2016 and will have a better chance of filling 54,000 seats if supporters like the man in the dugout. A \xe2\x80\x9cBig Sam Out\xe2\x80\x9d banner was unveiled after the stoppage-time defeat by Everton in West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s final home match.</p> <p>Yet the move to the Olympic Stadium means that parting ways with Allardyce is fraught with uncertainty. West Ham cannot afford to go down next season and a complication for whoever gets the job will be the distraction of European football. If West Ham are granted a bonus Europa League spot because of their excellent fair play record, their season will start with the first qualifying round on 2 July.</p> <p>West Ham must hire a manager who can deal with that workload and there cannot be a repeat of what happened when they attempted to replace Grant with Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Neill in January 2011. West Ham were confident that they had their man. Yet the deal fell through and four months later Grant was sacked in the tunnel at the DW Stadium after a 3-2 defeat by Wigan Athletic had confirmed West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s relegation.</p> <p>Tempting Rafael Ben\xc3\xadtez to east London would undeniably have been a major coup and he was being lined up to take over from Allardyce. Then Real Madrid came calling after sacking Carlo Ancelotti. Back to square one.</p> <p>Other names have been mentioned. David Moyes has, over time, proven that he has a wilier, more varied touch than Allardyce. However Moyes has said he does not want to leave Real Sociedad yet and while Unai Emery would be an excellent appointment, his Sevilla side will qualify for the Champions League if they beat Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk in the Europa League final. There have also been links with Michael Laudrup, who is coaching in Qatar, but the way that his time at Swansea City ended should fill West Ham with unease.</p> <p>Bilic is the most obvious candidate. The Croat would be an exciting appointment and it is unlikely that life would ever be dull with him around. He could electrify Upton Park. Yet he has never managed in England or in one of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s top leagues. He would be a risk.</p> <p>Yet an ending like this always seemed inevitable. It has been a fractious alliance and cracks were visible even when West Ham were riding high in December, Sullivan revealing on television that signing Sakho was his idea. Allardyce has been on borrowed time since the 4-0 thrashing by West Bromwich Albion in the fifth round of the FA Cup in February.</p> <p>The speculation over his future has become a tedious distraction and this quickie divorce may be the best thing for both parties. Allardyce will find a new job, Sunderland perhaps, and he will probably succeed.</p> <p>As for West Ham? If everything goes to plan, their dream manager will lead them into their packed new stadium in August 2016. Just do not be surprised if they are coughing and spluttering in the winter months and wondering if they were in good enough health to chuck Allardyce in the bin.</p>'
