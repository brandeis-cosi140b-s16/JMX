b'Football transfer rumours: Marco Reus to swap Dortmund for Arsenal?'


b'<p>The Mill has always depended on the kindness of strangers. The strangers who have the time and the wit to spawn some rascally rumours that the Mill could never imagine at this ungodly hour. And the strangers who have the time and wit to gather these ruminations and plonk them all in one place so that the Mill does not have to bother looking elsewhere at this ungodly hour.</p> <p>That most of these rumours make as much sense as one of those guys with saliva dribbling out of his mouth who wanders into a cafeteria with a shopping bag screaming about socialism, matters not one jot. In fact, the bigger they come, the better they are. The Mill want lies as tall as a Japanese spider crab standing on top of a giraffe standing on top of the Empire State Building standing on top of a Brachiosaurus. Speaking of.</p> <p>With the transfer window as firmly shut as a pub in Dublin on Good Friday, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger has finally snapped into action. He is on the phone to agents, he is talking big money, he is promising players the sun and the moon. He is walking around the Emirates making sure that all the carpets are clean, that all the pictures are hung straight and that any prospective employee he is showing around can get their nose into the smell of fresh lobster that he personally bought from the fishmongers on Broadway Market and that he personally is looking after in the kitchen. The next prospective employee that Wenger hopes to be taking by the elbow as he details the club\xe2\x80\x99s glorious history is Marco Reus.</p> <p>Wenger tried to sign the Borussia Dortmund forward during the summer just gone but was told by the German club that he would have more of a chance playing a Betamax in a VHS recorder than he would of tempting Reus to the bright lights and dark nights of London. Now, however, Wenger has been talking to a man, who has been talking to a man, who once knew a man who once was in a room with the second cousin of Reus\xe2\x80\x99s father\xe2\x80\x99s brother-in-law and the word that has come back to Wenger is that the young man might well be open to a move. Given that Reus is the most coveted player currently twinkle-toeing his way around Europe and will cost less than the price of two Shane Longs, Arsenal are going to be facing some stiff competition for the young man with the ever impressive fringe.</p> <p>In other news, man will soon be able to fly, unicorns will grow on trees, the banks will say sorry for ruining the world and the Gunners will sign a decent midfield player in the shape of Sami Khedira. No seriously. All of that is going to happen. Except for the banks one of course.</p> <p>Elsewhere, the top brass over at Manchester United have had their weekly powwow and decided that the things they are most worried about right now are privacy in the digital age, the rise of Isis and the team\xe2\x80\x99s defence. Now the Mill would have thought that the best way to solve the last one of these would be to invest in the type of central defender who is experienced and who would bring a sense of authority to a back line that looks as settled as the sea off Alaska in winter time. But the suits up north have other ideas. They reckon wiring \xc2\xa360m to the Juventus bank account in exchange for Paul Pogba should do the trick. Of course, Pogba left Old Trafford kicking and screaming and crying like a baby that needs their nappy changed, so he will undoubtedly be delighted to move back. Should the deal fail to go though, however, Chelsea and Real Madrid will be on hand to pick up the pieces.</p> <p>Incidentally, Pogba will not be the only one making his way back to Manchester and back to Old Trafford. Cristiano Ronaldo is going to do one too. No really. \xe2\x80\x9cI love Manchester,\xe2\x80\x9d he swooned. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone knows that. I have said it many times. Manchester is in my heart. I left many good friends there, the supporters are amazing and I wish I can come back one day.\xe2\x80\x9d See! Told you!</p> <p>And finally to Liverpool where Fabio Borini has taken time out from his busy job of protecting the MAN to hear what the guys over at Internazionale have to say. According to someone who was listening in on their conversation, the second that the January transfer window opens the Milanese club are going to pick up the phone and dial Liverpool. Once Brendan Rodgers has stopped laughing, a deal will be agreed and Borini will get on a privately chartered plane and start looking forward to shopping in the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II and hanging out with the glitterati at Hollywood Rythmoteque.</p>'
