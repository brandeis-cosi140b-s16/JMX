b'The Fiver | A mission is never finished'


b'WE ARE FAMILEEEEE! <p>And so now we know. Earlier today Sepp Blatter announced that he is indeed to stand for yet another four-year term as Fifa president. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, a mission is never finished,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mission is not finished.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Like a Nepali aspiring construction worker just setting out for Qatar, Blatter said he was \xe2\x80\x9cgoing forward like an optimist\xe2\x80\x9d, though he added that \xe2\x80\x9coptimists live better and perhaps they live longer\xe2\x80\x9d, which appears to be not at all true of those construction workers. Still you can see why Blatter, who will be 83 by the end of his next term, would want to believe it.</p> <p>And so it is that next May, at the Fifa congress in Zurich, Blatter is hoping that key figures from around the world will unite in stuffing envelopes full of paper and writing his name on them. And he is full of confidence: they have done so many times in the past, and his only competition is likely to be J\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xb4me Champagne, the self-employed \xe2\x80\x9cinternational football consultant\xe2\x80\x9d and former Fifa staffer who boasts of having \xe2\x80\x9cvisited almost 150 countries around the world, including Mauritius\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Blatter said that he first resolved to continue as football\xe2\x80\x99s cat-stroking underground-lair-dwelling swivel-chaired villain-in-chief in S\xc3\xa3o Paulo shortly before this year\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup, when he was overwhelmed by the support he received. \xe2\x80\x9cThe majority \xe2\x80\x93 huge majority \xe2\x80\x93 of national associations asked, \xe2\x80\x98Please, go on, please be our president also in future\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he revealed.</p> <p>Blatter was presumably also moved by the simultaneous swelling of popular support, which saw large groups of Brazilians take to the streets in order to loudly back his presidency according to local custom, by throwing missiles and burning tyres while loudly chanting, as an official Fifa translator may well have told their avuncular president, that he remain in charge indefinitely so as to continue his visionary leadership of the organisation. \xe2\x80\x9cI will make an official declaration in September,\xe2\x80\x9d he promised. \xe2\x80\x9cI will say to the football family, \xe2\x80\x98Yes, I will be ready.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Blatter also reiterated his support of in-game television-based refereeing aids, which he defined snappily as \xe2\x80\x9cthis so-called \xe2\x80\x98call\xe2\x80\x99 that the coaches or team managers have the right in the half, twice or once, to have a call to challenge a refereeing decision but only when the game has stopped, then the referee and coach look at it and the referee may then change his mind\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>This revolutionary move would mean that a decision-maker could make up their mind on an issue, signal their decision to the watching world, and still get the opportunity, having had their attention brought to the fact that many people think they got it totally wrong, to change their mind. Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s still possible that Blatter might himself perform precisely such an about-turn? It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem particularly likely but the Fiver, as ever, is going forward like an optimist.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Simon Burnton for MBM commentary on Switzerland 2-1 England while Michael Butler will be on Clockwatch duty for the rest of tonight\xe2\x80\x99s Euro 2016 qualifying action.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI scored past Manuel Neuer!!!!
