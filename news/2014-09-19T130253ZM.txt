b'Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Manuel Pellegrini defends Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 performance'


b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini has defended Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 following the midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s disappointing display in Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s defeat to Bayern Munich in Bavaria.</p> <p>City lost the opening Champions League group game 1-0 on Wednesday evening with the midfielder virtually anonymous.</p> <p>Yet Pellegrini is insistent that Tour\xc3\xa9 should not be criticised in the wake of only one performance.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is fair to criticise what Yaya did in the last game. I think that, in this team, my way of thinking, normally when we win or lose it is because all the team did well or bad. Everyone knows which is his best performance of all the players and we are trying to reach that best performance. I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree Yaya has all the responsibility about the game we played,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>City fans took to social media to question Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s contribution against Bayern. But despite this and the Ivorian\xe2\x80\x99s unsettled summer when he and his agent claimed the club did not celebrate his birthday enough the manager believes Tour\xc3\xa9 remains focused on City.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYaya always has commitment with the team and the squad and with his mates and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any problems about that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pellegrini, who rejected he should be worried about Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s form. \xe2\x80\x9cThe concerns are about the performance of the team. Maybe we were very unlucky to lose that game in the last minute with a very unpredictable goal but I think as a team we can play better. That is why every week I try to improve what we do as a team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini also stated that Frank Lampard, who will be in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s squad for Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99a visit, would still be at the west London club if he had been wanted.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is a difficult situation for him,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Chilean. \xe2\x80\x9cI think Frank didn\xe2\x80\x99t continue in Chelsea because Chelsea didn\xe2\x80\x99t want him, not because he wanted to come here to Manchester City. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t continue with the team he played his whole life for. He has all the rights to continue playing football. He arrived here. We are very happy with him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Regarding injury concerns, Pellegrini added: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is OK. Jovetic and Fernando continue with problems. Edin Dzeko has a problem in his back after the game but I hope he will be OK for Sunday. All the other players are OK.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
