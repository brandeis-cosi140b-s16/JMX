b'Dick Advocaat\xe2\x80\x99s love of order perfect antidote to Sunderland volatility'


b'<p>When Dick Advocaat took a call from a Dutch journalist on Monday night the reporter asked if he was at the Stadium of Light. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m in a dark hotel room,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s new head coach, revealing a sense of humour he could do with retaining over the coming weeks.</p> <p>After being confirmed as Gus Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s interim successor before taking training for the first time on Monday morning, Advocaat\xe2\x80\x99s not insignificant task is to switch the lights on at a club teetering on the brink of relegation. He has a nine-game contract to keep Sunderland in the Premier League but, despite a wealth of worldwide managerial experience, this represents something of a novel challenge for the 67-year-old.</p> <p>In the past 20 years Advocaat has been involved in only one relegation skirmish and it concluded with him leaving Borussia M\xc3\xb6nchengladbach a month before the end of the 2004-05 season, with the German side one point above the drop zone.</p> <p>That is precisely the position he finds Sunderland in but his supporters point to the domestic titles he has won in the Netherlands, Scotland and Russia as well as the World Cup quarter-final and European Championship semi-final he reached with Holland.</p> <p>While Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s board hope a coach fluent in English will reinvigorate the club in much the same way Guus Hiddink revived Chelsea during a brief caretaker stint in 2009, Advocaat is a very different animal from his charming compatriot. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a Dutch saying that \xe2\x80\x98he sees an enemy behind every tree,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d says Suleyman Ozturk a journalist from Voetbal International. \xe2\x80\x9cIn private he\xe2\x80\x99s a very nice man with a very good sense of humour but, publicly, he can be guarded.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>This caution extends on to the pitch. \xe2\x80\x9cAdvocaat\xe2\x80\x99s not a great adventurer, he\xe2\x80\x99s more calculating,\xe2\x80\x9d Ozturk says. \xe2\x80\x9cSunderland fans are unlikely to see wing-backs. He\xe2\x80\x99s very strict but he\xe2\x80\x99s got an aura about him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Dutch football journalist Michiel Jongsma regards Advocaat\xe2\x80\x99s love of order as precisely what Sunderland require after Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s volatility. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s very impressive,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s quite a conservative man of discipline who likes structure and after Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s unpredictability that should be welcome. He\xe2\x80\x99s also good at identifying the strengths of individual players.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>If there is a concern that the last thing a side paralysed by Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s tactical negativity need is a coach inclined to play with the handbrake on, Advocaat\xe2\x80\x99s Zenit St Petersburg did produce some fabulous football en route to winning the 2008 Uefa Cup. With the posting so short term, his infamous reluctance to trust young players is hardly relevant.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAdvocaat\xe2\x80\x99s a pragmatist, not an idealist, he\xe2\x80\x99s a sensible man and a sensible manager; I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll play 4-4-2 or maybe 4-5-1 at Sunderland,\xe2\x80\x9d Jongsma says. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s had some tough moments but almost all the clubs he\xe2\x80\x99s worked for have fond memories of him. When he was younger he could be a bit of a hard man but, although respect is still very important to him, he\xe2\x80\x99s mellowed with age. He\xe2\x80\x99ll see Sunderland as an adventure to be enjoyed.\xe2\x80\x9d Even so, Sunderland players should probably refrain from making jokes about the hair transplant Advocaat famously underwent in the 1990s.</p> <p>One man well qualified to judge the partnership is Bolo Zenden, the former Sunderland and Holland midfielder. \xe2\x80\x9cAdvocaat can convince the players to give everything,\xe2\x80\x9d Zenden says. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a coach who will listen to the players. He can be tough, though \xe2\x80\x93 and that\xe2\x80\x99s something Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s players need.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>If a sometimes confrontational character who once had a dramatic falling out with Ruud Gullit has toned down his act, Advocaat retains an edge \xe2\x80\x93 especially when the name Louis van Gaal is involved. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99ve spent \xc2\xa3200m you should make sure you compete for the top two,\xe2\x80\x9d he informed Dutch TV viewers in a scathing deconstruction of Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s manager. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s working for him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Things failed to proceed to plan for Advocaat during a traumatic four-month culture shock with Serbia last year. \xe2\x80\x9cI never faced such a difficult situation in my entire career,\xe2\x80\x9d he said after departing in November with a single point from three European Championship qualifiers and having watched askance from his technical area as a match between Serbia and Albania in Belgrade was abandoned as anarchy unfolded in the wake of an Albanian flag being flown above the stadium by a drone.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe made a mistake with Serbia,\xe2\x80\x9d Ozturk says, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll put it right at Sunderland.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> What awaits Dick Advocaat in his in-tray 1 Unlock a creative spark <p>Sunderland say they are \xe2\x80\x9creviewing\xe2\x80\x9d Adam Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s club suspension after his police bail was extended until late April. Johnson has been exiled following his arrest on suspicion of sexual activity with an underage girl but Advocaat wants the winger, the team\xe2\x80\x99s principal creator, back in the fold.</p> 2 Keep Lee Cattermole fit and suspension-free <p>Without Cattermole bossing midfield the team invariably struggle but he is both yellow card and injury prone. Gus Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s successor needs to keep him on the pitch.</p> 3 Find a way to get Jermain Defoe scoring <p>Defoe craves both an attacking partner and crosses to feed off. Advocaat must supply him with both. Maybe Patrick van Aanholt could be turned into a left-winger and Connor Wickham relocated from the left.</p> 4 Raise the tempo <p>Too often under Poyet Sunderland played at exhibition pace and seemed scared to press opponents. Advocaat must ask them to force the tempo and press higher up the pitch.</p> 5 Persuade John O\xe2\x80\x99Shea and Wes Brown to roll back the years <p>Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s centre-halves are getting on and hardly the quickest these days but O\xe2\x80\x99Shea and Brown retain sufficient defensive intelligence to avert relegation. Advocaat must tap into it while protecting their vulnerabilities.</p>'
