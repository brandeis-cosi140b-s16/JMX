b'<p>Aston Villa\xe2\x80\x99s momentum has been checked by consecutive 3-0 defeats by Arsenal and Chelsea but they may feel this is a good time to play Manchester City. Paul Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s side won this fixture last season and they will hope that the champions are feeling sore after the disappointment of their 1-1 draw with Roma in the Champions League on Tuesday. But Manuel Pellegrini will back his forwards to produce the goods.
