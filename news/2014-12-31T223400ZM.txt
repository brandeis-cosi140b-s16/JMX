b'Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Frank Lampard can face Sunderland with loan extended'


b'<p>Manchester City will be able to field Frank Lampard against Sunderland on Thursday if required, after the club were able to extend his loan deal from New York City until the end of the season.</p> <p>City have been waiting on news of the 36-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s future, with the midfielder having been on a short-term deal which was due to expire on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day when he would officially become a player of NYC \xe2\x80\x93 the champions\xe2\x80\x99 sister club.</p> <p>Owing to the former Chelsea player\xe2\x80\x99s excellent performances and City\xe2\x80\x99s presence in the race for the Premier and Champions League, the club had been keen to keep him beyond the agreed date. And, with three hours of the year left, City announced the news in a short statement on their website. It read: \xe2\x80\x9cManchester City can confirm it has extended Frank Lampard\xe2\x80\x99s contract up to the end of Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s season, enabling his continued participation in both domestic and European campaigns.\xe2\x80\x9d Lampard will now also miss the start of the MLS season.</p> <p>Manuel Pellegrini has been consistent in his praise of Lampard and was asked about his future on Wednesday, when he again stressed the player\xe2\x80\x99s importance to his side.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI said during December we will know what happens with the future of Frank Lampard. It is important for him to stay with us. Today we finish December. I hope today we will have news,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe understand that Frank is eligible to play but it is not a thing I want to continue talking about because there are a lot of parts involved in this discussion and it should remain private. It is my intention for Frank to stay here. He also wants to stay but it is not easy just to do in two or three days.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Lampard\xe2\x80\x99s stay has added value with Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 set to go to the Africa Cup of Nations while City are also light on proven scorers with Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero and Edin Dzeko injured.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYaya goes to Africa on 5 January, so he is available on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day and for the FA Cup,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini said.</p> <p>Vincent Kompany will miss both those games with his calf/hamstring injury but City expect him back early in the new year. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think Vincent will be fit this week,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini said. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe he will be available for next week\xe2\x80\x99s game against Everton.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>City missed an opportunity to move closer to Chelsea at the weekend by letting a two-goal lead slip against Burnley, dropping two home points and ending a nine-match winning streak that began after a draw against Queens Park Rangers. Pellegrini denied City have a problem with complacency against so-called lesser teams. \xe2\x80\x9cIn our last 10 league games we took 26 points, so I must be happy,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI would be happier with 30 but 26 is a very good return and I will be delighted if we can do as well in our next 10 games.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe are playing much better now than at the start of the season but in this league it is impossible to win every game. There are good teams all the way down the table.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He is no happier than anyone else at having to play so many games in a short time at this time of year and questioned whether it was necessary to have games on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day as well as Boxing Day. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not the best thing for footballers to play again after 48 hours but, if all the other teams are having to do it, then you can\xe2\x80\x99t complain,\xe2\x80\x9d Pellegrini said. \xe2\x80\x9cI understand that Boxing Day football is a strong tradition in England but to play the following Sunday and then New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day is asking a lot.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
