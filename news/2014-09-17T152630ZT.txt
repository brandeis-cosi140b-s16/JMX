b'The Fiver | Who could possibly have predicted it?'


b'ARS\xc3\x88NE: NO <p>When Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger woke this morning, you might expect that he would\xe2\x80\x99ve felt a pang of regret. Regret, that his Arsenal side couldn\xe2\x80\x99t seriously challenge a Borussia Dortmund missing their best central defender, their right-back, two starting central midfielders and two starting attacking midfielders. Or that they were so overrun that the 2-0 scoreline was flattering, to say the least. Or that Danny Welbeck couldn\xe2\x80\x99t finish when given the chance, thus hinting at the fears of any Arsenal fan that he simply wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t score enough goals. Or that their defending at times might as well have been soundtracked with circus music. Or that their Champions League campaign is off to a losing start, and means in all probability that if they qualify, they will do so in second place, and will thus play some of the competition\xe2\x80\x99s big dogs and potentially face another premature exit.</p> <p>The thing is though, he probably won\xe2\x80\x99t feel any of that regret. Because Ars\xc3\xa8ne Knows, you see. He Knows what\xe2\x80\x99s best. And best is going into the season with only six senior defenders, one of whom is a left-back made of toothpicks, another a 19-year-old who is first reserve in two positions and another who is Nacho Monreal. Best is subsequently having to give another 19-year-old his first-team debut in one of the most intimidating away grounds on the continent. Best is not buying a proper holding midfielder, someone with a bit of oomph and presence, perhaps. Best is instead playing Mikel Arteta there, a nice guy and decent player with lovely hair, but one who is out of his depth in games like this these days, if he was ever in his depth. Best is playing Mesut \xc3\x96zil on the right wing.</p> <p>Still, at least he didn\xe2\x80\x99t get quite the kicking of the man returning to his homeland. German paper Bild has a frankly maverick system of rating players, giving them a mark of one to six, with six being the worst, suggesting that the player \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t earn his money.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc3\x96zil, who would\xe2\x80\x99ve influenced the game more if he\xe2\x80\x99d wheeled a La-Z-Boy to the touchline and read Tim Lovejoy\xe2\x80\x99s opus on football Lovejoy On Football for 90 minutes [No way it would\xe2\x80\x99ve taken him that long to read it \xe2\x80\x93 Fiver Ed.], inevitably received a six, the worst mark on the pitch, such was his anonymity.</p> <p>Still, at least Wenger can rest safe in the knowledge that all of the problems that emerged in Dortmund were unforeseen, unexpected and hugely surprising for all concerned. After all, who could possibly have predicted they would be troubled by a few injuries, look shaky at the back, limp in midfield and toothless up front? Nobody thought to mention it before this week, particularly not to Wenger himself. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry Ars\xc3\xa8ne, absolutely nobody saw this sort of thing coming. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing you could\xe2\x80\x99ve done.</p> <p>The responsibility lies with Wenger. His way is best, he does Know after all, which largely seems an acceptable notion because he won the league 10 years ago. Wenger guiding Arsenal to the Champions League for 17 years in a row is usually pointed to as a reason for him sticking around, but is it really something to get whoop-whoop excited about if they\xe2\x80\x99ve only come close to winning the thing once in that time? The rest of the time they\xe2\x80\x99ve just been there, rather than actually competing.</p> <p>It would be interesting to see a Venn diagram of the people that still want Wenger to be Arsenal manager, and the people that are unhappy with the state in which he has left his squad, and talk to those who occupy the common ground in the middle. Surely, after a couple of decades with him around, they know Wenger isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to change. He\xe2\x80\x99ll still be the same stubborn old boy who won\xe2\x80\x99t buy a proper midfielder and who won\xe2\x80\x99t change his approach and who will think the defence is fine because they\xe2\x80\x99ve got a youth team full-back who\xe2\x80\x99s never played a game before as cover. And he\xe2\x80\x99ll deliver the same seasons: third or fourth place, disappointing exit in the early knockout rounds of the Champions League. Like clockwork. Shane Warne once said England spinner and al fresco urinator Monty Panesar hadn\xe2\x80\x99t played 33 Tests (that\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98cricket matches\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 the long ones), but he\xe2\x80\x99d played one Test 33 times. Arsenal haven\xe2\x80\x99t played 17 Champions League campaigns, they\xe2\x80\x99ve played one campaign 17 times.</p> <p>This is, Wenger would like us to point out, only one game \xe2\x80\xa6 except it isn\xe2\x80\x99t, is it? It\xe2\x80\x99s the Arsenal of the last decade boiled down to 90 minutes. Really quite good in the scheme of things, but nowhere near good enough against the best. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to work out what must be more depressing for Gooners everywhere \xe2\x80\x93 the crushing predictability of it all, or the glimmer of hope that appears at the start of every season, only to flicker out in a few weeks.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Paul Doyle from 7.45pm BST for MBM coverage of Bayern Munich 6-5 Manchester City, and Ian McCourt for Chelsea 8-3 Schalke (Trust us, we\xe2\x80\x99re on a roll).</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was totally gutless. I told one or two in the changing room that they can go. I told them \xe2\x80\x98go and get yourself a club\xe2\x80\x99. It was just cowardly and embarrassing. Five or six of them looked out of their depth. They don\xe2\x80\x99t look up to it. They were jumping out of tackles. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen anything like it. It was shambolic, weak defending. They are looking miles out of their depth.
