b'Gerard Piqu\xc3\xa9: \xe2\x80\x98Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez is a really fair player. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if he bit before\xe2\x80\x99'


b'<p>Gerard Piqu\xc3\xa9 chose a training session at Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper complex last week to test whether Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez\xe2\x80\x99s rehabilitation extended to seeing the funny side. The Catalans\xe2\x80\x99 first team were drilling defence versus attack, centre-halves wrestling aggressively with forwards in a cluttered six-yard box while crosses were flung over from the flank. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were fighting for the ball all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d explained Piqu\xc3\xa9. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were scrapping, me and him, so I shouted: \xe2\x80\x98Hey, don\xe2\x80\x99t you dare bite me.\xe2\x80\x99 He just smiled. He knows what he did back in the summer was not right, and he accepts that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It was a passing flashpoint, some playful ribbing among team-mates, but it offered an insight into Su\xc3\xa1rez\xe2\x80\x99s latest recovery from a high-profile misdemeanour. The four-month ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup victory over Italy in Natal, his third sanction for similar offences, is spent.</p> <p>In the intervening period the striker has been transferred for \xc2\xa375m from Liverpool, where he had been idolised, to Bar\xc3\xa7a with the suspension a test of patience over recent weeks. At the Bernab\xc3\xa9u on Saturday he will be unleashed back into competitive action on the grandest of club stages: el cl\xc3\xa1sico awaits. A lack of match fitness may initially anchor him to the bench but, mentally, he is eager. No one dares suggest he is champing at the bit, but that is the general idea.</p> <p>There is an acceptance he will be rusty. Su\xc3\xa1rez has scored braces for Barcelona B against an Indonesian Under-19 select XI and for Uruguay against Oman, and provided an assist in his other international friendly against Saudi Arabia, but those three outings are his only ones since the summer. This is a collision with European champions.</p> <p>Had July\xe2\x80\x99s original Fifa judgment not been watered down by the court of arbitration for sport then he would not even have been permitted to train while the ban was in place. As it is, Piqu\xc3\xa9 and his team-mates have experienced his quality first-hand. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen he first arrived he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t play and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t trained, and was dead after 10 minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d laughed the defender. \xe2\x80\x9cI was saying: \xe2\x80\x98What happened to you, man?\xe2\x80\x99 But after two or three weeks he started getting fitter, and now he\xe2\x80\x99s ready. In training he\xe2\x80\x99s unbelievable. He has got something.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it: there will be two or three rebounds in the box and then, definitely, the ball is at his feet and he scores. From nothing he can score. He is a different style of player to those we had before. Xavi, Iniesta \xe2\x80\xa6 they are really sweet and you enjoy watching them with the ball. With Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez it is the other side: he fights. But he scores, and that is what it is all about. You can kick him in training and he never falls to the floor. He\xe2\x80\x99ll keep trying to score even if you\xe2\x80\x99re pulling his shirt or fouling him. He is a really fair player.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPeople say he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in England but, there, if you fall once you have a reputation. In training he never goes to the floor. He pressures defenders to recover the ball. I was really happy we signed him. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care if he bit [someone] before. He knows it\xe2\x80\x99s not the way, and he said he won\xe2\x80\x99t do it again. And he\xe2\x80\x99s in the top three strikers in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>El cl\xc3\xa1sico should have flung six of the best forwards in the global game in confrontation. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe the best ever [six],\xe2\x80\x9d said Piqu\xc3\xa9. \xe2\x80\x9cYears ago Barcelona had Ronaldo, and Madrid had Ra\xc3\xbal, but to have three each of this kind of quality? No.\xe2\x80\x9d As it is, Gareth Bale\xe2\x80\x99s untimely buttock injury and Su\xc3\xa1rez\xe2\x80\x99s lack of match fitness have postponed the ultimate in forward-line set-tos, but this is still Leo Messi against Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar against Karim Benzema, with Su\xc3\xa1rez, James Rodr\xc3\xadguez, Ivan Rakitic and Toni Kroos all entering the frenzy for the first time.</p> <p>The contest may lack the poison that festered during the tenures of Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho and Pep Guardiola at the respective clubs, but spikiness endures. Piqu\xc3\xa9 has tasted this occasion often enough in the six years since he left Manchester United, though the adrenaline rush of the biggest club fixture in Spanish football is a constant.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn England you have the big games but you don\xe2\x80\x99t have el cl\xc3\xa1sico,\xe2\x80\x9d he offered with a wink. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is different. I have been in the Premier League and [experienced] United against Liverpool but, maybe because I am a Bar\xc3\xa7a fan, Barcelona against Real is a different level. The country just stops for this game. I really enjoyed the rivalry in that time [against Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s Real] even if it\xe2\x80\x99s true that sometimes it did cross the line, and that was not right. We had to meet up afterwards with Spain. Everything that happens on the pitch must stay out on the pitch. After that you have to remain friends.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey are strong. Real\xe2\x80\x99s frontline are really quick and powerful. Bale and Cristiano, the wingers, can smash and destroy you if you are not careful. Benzema receives the balls and brings others into the game. But the main thing for us is to be careful when we have the ball because that is when we are open and, if we lose it, they start to run, they play long balls and it\xe2\x80\x99s really difficult to catch them. As defenders, we have to be constantly on our marks. Under Guardiola we played the best football I can remember, playing good games at the Bernab\xc3\xa9u and winning most of them. It has been harder in the last few years as we\xe2\x80\x99ve not played as we did in the past. But it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to stay at that level. We are talking about one of the best teams in the history of football.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cUnder Luis Enrique, we\xe2\x80\x99ve changed the mentality again and we\xe2\x80\x99re pressuring a lot, really high up the pitch. In the first two or three seconds when [the opposition] have the ball they suffer a lot, as our strikers are pushing them. They have no time to build. Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid know that if they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the ball they all have to defend, no matter who they are [playing]. They are very compact and difficult to break down. But at Barcelona we are used to having the ball and when we lose it we are open, with a lot of spaces. So if you don\xe2\x80\x99t press they can attack those spaces, then you are dead. I know when you win titles the stars are the strikers and when you don\xe2\x80\x99t it\xe2\x80\x99s because of the goalkeeper and the defenders, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not just about the defenders. It\xe2\x80\x99s about all the team working hard together.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Bar\xc3\xa7a are still adapting to Enrique, even if their league record \xe2\x80\x93 seven wins from eight unbeaten matches and a four-point advantage over Real \xe2\x80\x93 suggests resurgence. Piqu\xc3\xa9 is reluctantly learning that life is about rotation under this manager, with centre-half duties shared between him, Marc Bartra, J\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9my Mathieu, Javier Mascherano and, once fully fit, the new arrival Thomas Vermaelen. The World Cup and European Championships winner has started only six games in all competitions, sitting out key clashes such as the loss to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. For a player who had won the World Cup at 23 and has claimed two European Cups as well as league titles in England and Spain, life consigned to the fringes can feel incongruous amid constant success.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a strange career, it\xe2\x80\x99s a really good career, but now I have a big challenge. At Manchester United I had Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic ahead of me, players who were never injured, never red carded \xe2\x80\xa6 fucking hard [to dislodge]. But this is the first time at Barcelona I\xe2\x80\x99m not playing as much as I want to. A lot of people say: \xe2\x80\x98Piqu\xc3\xa9 is not fit or not playing well.\xe2\x80\x99 But Piqu\xc3\xa9 is really playing well. After the World Cup I admitted I maybe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been at my level, but in pre-season I worked really hard and I\xe2\x80\x99m really happy about my performances during the season. I have to show the coach I can play every game and don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be rotated because I\xe2\x80\x99m desperate to play in El Cl\xc3\xa1sico.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Retaining his place in the team has become the centre-half\xe2\x80\x99s priority. He is settled and content in Catalonia, one recent late-night altercation with the guardia urbana aside, with a young family, Shakira on his arm and successful businesses to his name. He is hands-on off the pitch, whether tweaking his phone app or developing his computer management game. There is no desire to return to United, whose interest is persistent and, given their defensive fragility, understandable.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was really happy and left a lot of friends there, even if I didn\xe2\x80\x99t play as much as I\xe2\x80\x99d wanted, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve always said I want to stay here all my career and retire at Barcelona,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the moment I\xe2\x80\x99m not thinking about leaving. I\xe2\x80\x99m really happy if it\xe2\x80\x99s true that United want me \xe2\x80\xa6 but I\xe2\x80\x99m a Barcelona fan, I have been since I was a kid. I want to stay here.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Piqu\xc3\xa9 on Gareth Bale <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe had a big handicap because he cost a lot of money. There were a lot of questions about him: is he really good? Can he perform well enough to justify costing \xe2\x82\xac100m? But I think he\xe2\x80\x99s doing a really good job at Real Madrid. I was injured with my hip when he scored in the Copa del Rey final last season [running around Marc Bartra off the pitch to score the winner]. Would I have fouled him? You are talking about not even one second and you have to make a decision. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy when you\xe2\x80\x99re sitting on your sofa and say: \xe2\x80\x98Ah, you have to do this, you little bastard \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x99 But when you\xe2\x80\x99re on the pitch, it\xe2\x80\x99s really difficult to make a good decision.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Piqu\xc3\xa9 on Spain\xe2\x80\x99s recent toils <p>\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of important players such as Xavi, Xabi Alonso and Puyol have retired, while David Villa is in Australia. Vicente del Bosque has to find replacements. It is a difficult time because, obviously, that is half the team. We won the Euros with the old players, but it\xe2\x80\x99s easy for people to criticise given the World Cup was not as good as we\xe2\x80\x99d hoped. But we have two years to change for the France Euros, where Vicente can improve with the others. We have to qualify and try to find the best team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Piqu\xc3\xa9 on Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas <p>\xe2\x80\x9cCesc went to Arsenal first but they said they had [Mesut] \xc3\x96zil, so he went to Chelsea instead. He is really happy there, and playing well. He loves London, even if I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if he loves Mourinho. He probably does because he is in the team, playing all the games. In Barcelona it was more difficult for him. It was one of the toughest decisions in his life to leave Bar\xc3\xa7a for a second time but, after three months, you can see he made the right decision. He\xe2\x80\x99s enjoying his life, playing every minute. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like to be rotated, and I\xe2\x80\x99m happy for him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Sky Sports is showing more of the games that matter in an unrivalled schedule of football, including el cl\xc3\xa1sico and Manchester United v Chelsea this weekend</p>'
