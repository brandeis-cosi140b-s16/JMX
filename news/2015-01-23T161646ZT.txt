b'The special Fiver-issue biohazard suit'


b'SHOW ME WHAT YOU\xe2\x80\x99RE WORKING WITH <p>When Weird Uncle Fiver announces that he has a twitchy a$$, The Fiver knows the drill. Code red. You just have to act as fast as you can possibly can, sprint upstairs, don the special Fiver-issue biohazard suit, run to the nearest phone, realise that it\xe2\x80\x99s quite hard to use a phone while wearing a special Fiver-issue biohazard suit, remove the special Fiver-issue biohazard suit, call the Environment Agency, wonder whether you should hold your breath to stop the fumes coming in, realise that would make it impossible to speak on the phone, take too long to make up your mind, pass out for a few minutes through lack of oxygen, wake up, dial the phone, tell the Environment Agency that it\xe2\x80\x99s happened again and then put the special Fiver-issue biohazard suit back on and wait for the agents to arrive. Soon the entire neighbourhood will have been evacuated and a containment tent will have been set up. Can\xe2\x80\x99t be too careful.</p> <p>But hopefully they didn\xe2\x80\x99t react in the same way at Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s training ground when Louis van Gaal started talking about the strange sensation he experiences in his backside when his team plays 4-4-2. The critics have said that playing three at the back has left some fans pining for the rich entertainment United provided when David Moyes was their manager, because at least they had a few yucks and giggles back then, but Van Gaal will not budge. And if it looks like he\xe2\x80\x99s squirming in his seat, there\xe2\x80\x99s a jolly good reason for that; it was definitely not because he had stuffed a gerbil up there. \xe2\x80\x9cI said to my players I was squeezing my a$$ but I knew that was the wrong expression,\xe2\x80\x9d Van Gaal said, as the assembled hacks choked on their sausage rolls and tried to remember the internet acronym they hear the kids using these days when someone is offering too much information. \xe2\x80\x9cI meant I have twitched my a$$ on the bench because we were out of balance. We won against West Ham playing 4-4-2 for instance but all the time it was twitching your a$$ and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>By the standards of press briefings most managers make, this was a remarkably open admission. Maybe a little too open. Quite a lot to digest on a Friday afternoon, while it could be argued that a team that has had hundreds of millions spent on it thanks to the keen negotiating skills of Ed Woodward should be able to play in any system. But Van will not budge. He\xe2\x80\x99ll squirm and look a little green and hope no one notices, but he will not budge. \xe2\x80\x9cI know that with 4-4-2 the stats are giving positive results, we have won more with 4-4-2 in a diamond, but when you analyse the games then we have twitched our a$$ on the bench,\xe2\x80\x9d Van Gaal said, before expressing his hope that United do not take the challenge of tonight\xe2\x80\x99s trip to Cambridge United in the FA Cup lightly, else he might be sitting even more uncomfortably than usual. Although not as uncomfortably as The Fiver, who\xe2\x80\x99ll be watching the match alongside Weird Uncle Fiver for company. And he\xe2\x80\x99s just called to say he\xe2\x80\x99s ordered a couple of burritos.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Simon Burnton now for Ghana 1-1 Algeria and then at 7.55pm GMT for Cambridge United 1-3 Manchester United.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to working with ITV\xe2\x80\x99s talented pool of commentators and pundits on some of the very best football there is\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Mark Pougatch rocks up at ITV \xe2\x80\xa6 by replacing unbuttoning\xe2\x80\x99s Adrian Chiles as their main football anchor.</p>      FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSo the Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s now doing its own version of MTV Cribs (Barry Glendenning crashes Mr Em\xe2\x80\x99s gaff)? OMG, like wow, dawg! What\xe2\x80\x99s next?

Can I be one of 1,057 tedious Fiver readers to update you on what I was doing when I was 16? I had just been hired by Dunnes Stores and was paid the princely sum of \xc2\xa32.70 per hour, which kept me in \xc2\xa316 Pavement CDs and a weekly dose of alcopops.

Surely the honour of the wordiest meeting of football sides still belongs to the combined 15 syllables of 2010\xe2\x80\x99s Trinidad and Tobago versus Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. If the \xe2\x80\x98record\xe2\x80\x99 was set in 2010 and two subsequent clashes between Equatorial Guinea and Burkina Faso fail to break that record, then said record must still stand. Even the removal of assorted \xe2\x80\x98ands\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98thes\xe2\x80\x99 from that Caribbean clash would only result in a 12-syllable tie. Seriously Trevor, what did you think was going to happen?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Ben Graham.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhy oh why, Trevor, must you play with our pedantic urges, we are putty in your hands.

Wow. What happens to officials when they go into their stadium? When you go to a place like Shrewsbury with a home record like theirs is, the one thing you want is not an official that\xe2\x80\x99s going to be put under pressure, a crowd that\xe2\x80\x99s very good at working the official. A club that\xe2\x80\x99s very good at working the official.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>And Crimea could set up its own league which would be legally compatible with Uefa, according to the Russian minister for sport. \xe2\x80\x9cUefa has suggested setting [up] an independent Crimean structure, which would unite the existing football federations of Crimea and Sevastopol,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Vitaly Mutko.</p> STILL WANT MORE? <p>Eric Cantona\xe2\x80\x99s kung-fu kick 20 years on \xe2\x80\x93 the night that changed football forever.
