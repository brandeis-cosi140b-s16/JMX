b'DEADLINE DAY: SKY\xe2\x80\x99S THE LIMIT <p>Gary Cotterill at QPR. Amy Lewis at Swansea. Chris Hull at West Brom. Keith Downie at Newcastle. Mark Benstead at Sunderland. Nick Collins at Arsenal, possibly perched on a top of a step-ladder\xe2\x80\x8b. Fraser Dainton at Manchester City. Tim Thornton at Hull (why wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Chris Hull at Hull?). Rob Dorsett at Leicester City. Ben Ransom at Stoke. James Cooper at Manchester United. Paul Gilmour at Tottenham Hotspur. Peter Stevenson at Burnley. Since before first light on Deadline Day, Sky\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x8bdedicated army of sports news men and women have been deployed at various Premier League training grounds and empty stadia around the country, their ears unsullied by the unwanted intrusion of giant purple marital aids and other objects now that they\xe2\x80\x99re kept apart from the unwashed and occasionally feral hordes.</p> <p>At the time of writing, the big news of the day had come from Roger Clarke, whose cameraman had captured exclusive footage of a bemused fox out enjoying its morning constitutional at an otherwise deserted Crystal Palace training ground. Handed the unenviable task of following that, Rob Dorsett had to make do with reporting pictures of the considerably less cute and vulpine Stoke defender Robert Huth walking through a car park in Leicester on his way to complete a loan deal. Rides don\xe2\x80\x99t get much more white-knuckle. Elsewhere, on a day they\xe2\x80\x99ve \xe2\x80\x8balmost solely devoted to reporting the movements of footballers from one club to the other, it was with breathless excitement that Sky revealed the Big News that Spurs striker Harry Kane had signed a new and improved contract to not go anywhere for the next five-and-a-half years.</p> <p>Back in the studio, Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville were among many, many ex-pros \xe2\x80\x8bwith the unenviable job of making sense of all the exciting wheeling and dealing that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t happened. With yellow ties having long been de rigeur for anyone involved in reporting transfer news for Sky\xe2\x80\x99s biannual celebration, the maverick Mancunian wore an open collar and no tie, although the custardy jaundiced hue of his pocket square demonstrated that, for all his apparent rebelliousness, he is at heart a company man.</p> <p>A vision in blue instead of the regulation yellow in which she traditionally appears alongside excitable Scot Jim White on the deadline day home straight, Natalie Sawyer was this morning paired with Rob Wotton in a move that could scarcely be more shocking unless it was Lionel Messi signing for Rotherham United as the makeweight in a cash-plus-player deal for Conor Newton. The pair enjoyed a relaxed on-screen chemistry as they asked the probing questions of Gary and Jamie and Curbs and Walshy and Kammy and Roundy and Charlie, pausing occasionally to show hilarious photos of office banter boys wearing yellow socks and one forlorn spaniel whose owner had dressed him in a yellow tie. Frivolous pet-related tomfoolery it may be, but with the population gripped by intrigue regarding the likely whereabouts of West Brom midfielder Graham Dorrans this time tomorrow, it is important to ease the tension with some light relief.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE <p>Various Big Paper staff will be lurking about behind Simon Burnton rolling fags and prodding him with $ex toys as he liveblogs transfer deadline day right to the bitter end.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>January 2013: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are signing a player of potential. We always feel we develop players well. We have proved that many times. We hope the boy enjoys coming here\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Lord Ferg gives Wilfried Zaha the big welcome.</p> <p>February 2015: \xe2\x80\x9cWilfried Zaha has rejoined Crystal Palace from Manchester United on a permanent basis with the England winger believed to have signed a five-and-a-half-year contract\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Oh.</p> FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe. Friday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver: I feel you\xe2\x80\x99re doing yourself a disservice. You claim that no one is ever calm while reading the Fiver\xc2\xa0but I disagree. I\xe2\x80\x99m often calm and relaxed while reading the Fiver. In fact, \xe2\x80\x98relaxed\xe2\x80\x99 is probably an understatement. Maybe \xe2\x80\x98drowsy\xe2\x80\x99, or \xe2\x80\x98soporific\xe2\x80\x99. Basically, if I\xe2\x80\x99m still awake by \xe2\x80\x98Still Want More?\xe2\x80\x99, then it\xe2\x80\x99s a mini victory\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Matt Dony.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI watched Diego Costa sitting in the stands in his civvies during the stalemate with Man City, and then I watched an old episode of QI. The football had slightly more humorous moments, but what struck me was the extraordinary similarity of \xe2\x80\x8bCosta with laconic comic Rich Hall. Brothers from another mother? Question for your six readers \xe2\x80\x93 what other comedian / footballer twins are out there?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 John Boyd.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI wonder if Marten Allen\xe2\x80\x99s letter (Friday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver) could be the start of a new series of \xe2\x80\x98Mundane Encounters With Famous People\xe2\x80\x99 section of The Fiver. I\xe2\x80\x99ll continue the theme by recounting the tale of the time I was stood at the urinal next to Steve McManaman in The Merton Pub, Bootle, during his Liverpool FC heyday.
