b'The Fiver | A complete lack of capacity for self-analysis'


b'WAIT FOR THE RETURN GAME <p>The Fiver rarely needs a refresher course on how to make nobody happy. But when a little reminder is required, we stow away on a plane to Geneva, head 10km along the lake to Nyon, prostrate ourselves in front of the soaring ivory tower next to the shore and breathe deeply, fully, nourishingly. Then we go home again and, well, it\xe2\x80\x99s business as usual. Those infusions of Uefa-flavoured smelling salt rarely fail us, and it feels as if the air is particularly fecund just now. Our football-governing overlords might reasonably feel that it was on a hiding to nothing ruling on last week\xe2\x80\x99s awful scenes at the match between Serbia and Albania in Belgrade \xe2\x80\x93 and believe the Fiver, it\xe2\x80\x99d have a fair point \xe2\x80\x93 but rule it has and, whaddya know, nobody seems at all pleased.</p> <p>In a departure from their usual MO, such as one can ever be discerned, Uefa hasn\xe2\x80\x99t applied a sledgehammer to a nut this time around. Or, it would seem at first, the reverse. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t frogmarched a team out of a competition for an administrative error of little competitive consequence; nor has it fined a country whatever they\xe2\x80\x99ve got in their back pocket for, say, racist chanting. This time it has been even-handed to a degree verging on the devious. See that 3-0 win we\xe2\x80\x99ve just handed you, Serbia? Like it? Surprise? Well \xe2\x80\x93 ha! \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s disappeared. Unavailable. Had to be sent back. Keep the goals, but we can\xe2\x80\x99t give you the points anymore. Had you there, though! Get a load of our banter! That was the joke, there.</p> <p>The issue, and this is one that we won\xe2\x80\x99t have heard the last of, is whether even-handedness was the right response to this one. Serbia were given the victory but lost the spoils (although the three-goal swing either way will look \xe2\x80\x98interesting\xe2\x80\x99 if the sides have to be settled by their head-to-head record a year from now); they were also told to hold their next two home games behind closed doors; both FAs were fined \xe2\x82\xac100,000. Uefa giveth and Uefa taketh away, but circumspection has been lacking on either side in this ridiculous farrago, with both fact and myth being abused indiscriminately, and the gut reaction among both parties\xe2\x80\x99 sympathisers is seemingly to scream that the other should have been punished more.</p> <p>So instead let\xe2\x80\x99s look at how they could both have been punished more. Not one, not the other. We\xe2\x80\x99re not here to battle for either; our days in the boxing ring are long gone. The last time the Fiver took a breather in Nyon, Uefa had just fined Legia Warsaw \xe2\x82\xac80,000 for allowing their fans to display \xe2\x80\x93 the horror! \xe2\x80\x93 a banner that criticised Uefa. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause Football Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Matter, Money Does,\xe2\x80\x9d it read, responding to their ejection from the Big Cup for fielding an ineligible player for four minutes of a tie that had long since been won. That, there, was the price of expression.</p> <p>In which context another \xe2\x82\xac20,000 a head looks quite paltry for two adversaries that \xe2\x80\x93 between them and to whatever respective degree \xe2\x80\x93 cooked up a situation that enabled violence barely precedented on a football pitch in recent years and, for a minute or two, looked as if it could degenerate into something still worse. Facilitate a stunning piece of political provocation, start a fight on the pitch, allow convicted hooligans on to said pitch to keep it all ticking over: whoever did which part of this, is it just 25% worse than a banner laying into the governing body?</p> <p>We don\xe2\x80\x99t really know, because Uefa\xe2\x80\x99s scale for punishments slides to the verge of wobbling all over the place. And we\xe2\x80\x99re left with the continuation of what is a hopeless, endless situation for everybody involved \xe2\x80\x93 because if there is one thing that Serbia, Albania and Uefa all seem to have firmly in common, it is a complete lack of capacity for self-analysis. If this is the air we\xe2\x80\x99re breathing now, it\xe2\x80\x99s enough to make us hold our breath and let people start liking us.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think all the bad things I have been through are in the past. I believe I am on the right path now, dealing with the people who can help me, the right kind of people. Everyone has different ways of defending themselves. In my case, the pressure and tension came out in that way. There are other players who react by breaking someone\xe2\x80\x99s leg, or smashing someone\xe2\x80\x99s nose across their face. What happened with [Giorgio] Chiellini is seen as worse\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez also reveals he\xe2\x80\x99s been seeing a therapist in this excerpt from an exclusive interview in Big Paper and on Big Website on Saturday. And you can watch Simon Hattenstone\xe2\x80\x99s chat with him in this video.</p>     Men\xe2\x80\x99s fashion special, you say.

Balotelli may still be looking for his form, but his finishing and wardrobe removal choices are far from Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s main problems. And judging by the accompanying photo of the intimate moment between Pepe and Mario, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that Balotelli did not enthusiastically rip off his shirt and beg the nearest Real Madrid player for his merengue strip. Pepe looks like he was actually offering the shirt off his back as a consolation to a downcast Mario. Balotelli probably just obliged so as to not appear ungrateful. So please, Brendan Rodgers, let\xe2\x80\x99s not scapegoat Balotelli for Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s woes. Let\xe2\x80\x99s appeal to reason and sensibility. It was Pepe\xe2\x80\x99s fault!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Peter Oh.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI went on date with someone from Guardian Soulmates last night.
