b'<p>Per Mertesacker believes Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s 3-1 victory over Hull on Monday was a significant step towards finishing in second place in the Premier League behind Chelsea, while admitting he was at a loss to explain his side\xe2\x80\x99s attacking unpredictability.</p> <p>Santi Cazorla shone throughout for Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s side while first-half goals from Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez, who scored twice, and Aaron Ramsey put Hull out of sight before the break as Arsenal got back to winning ways after the goalless draw with Chelsea and moved level on points with second-placed Manchester City.</p> <p>Arsenal endured a slow start to the season that included a Champions League qualifier against Besiktas and despite their impressive recent run, were unable to catch the runaway leaders Chelsea, leaving Mertesacker eager to secure a direct passage to the Champions League group stages to boost their title bid next term.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe want to qualify directly for the Champions League. After the title is gone, that for us would be an improvement from last season where we had two qualifying matches, really tight ones, to secure Champions League football,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mertesacker.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the first target and then the FA Cup, to defend that title would be really amazing. That\xe2\x80\x99s the focus at the minute. It looks like we are quite sharp and the way we are going is really pleasing. It\xe2\x80\x99s so unpredictable what we are doing. Even for me at the back, it sometimes looks a bit weird what we are doing. Sometimes we lose the balance, sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s really good, so we have to keep on going and focusing on our game defensively to keep a clean sheet.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPost World Cup was not good enough, we have to admit that. But how we finish season after season is fantastic. But we have to be sharp from the start of the season. That is what we lack. The points we dropped at the start of the season were 10 or 11 points and that gap we could not close. We were consistent in 2015, but Chelsea did not drop many points.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League success makes it 11 seasons since Arsenal last won the title \xe2\x80\x93 as Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho was quick to point out after last month\xe2\x80\x99s draw \xe2\x80\x93 but Mertesacker will be content with a second-placed finish and victory in the FA Cup final against Aston Villa later this month.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t listen too much to what other people say. Our success is built on our unit and how we train every day,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mertesacker. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is our job, not thinking about what other people think. People have written us off a lot of times this season and we managed to deal with that. That\xe2\x80\x99s not our focus.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
