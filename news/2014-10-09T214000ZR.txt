b'<p>Roy Keane\xe2\x80\x99s most outspoken attack on Sir Alex Ferguson branched out into caustic criticisms of Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho as he branded the Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s manager conduct \xe2\x80\x9cdisgraceful\xe2\x80\x9d and explained why he refused to shake his hand towards the end of Aston Villa\xe2\x80\x99s recent match at Stamford Bridge. \xe2\x80\x9cThe game is still going on,\xe2\x80\x9d Keane said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do that on a Sunday morning, you would get knocked out.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Keane was talking at the official launch of his latest autobiography, The Second Half, where he accused Ferguson of telling \xe2\x80\x9clies, basic lies\xe2\x80\x9d about him and questioned why the media and other managers \xe2\x80\x93 with Tony Pulis indirectly referenced \xe2\x80\x93 were either \xe2\x80\x9cfrightened\xe2\x80\x9d of the former Manchester United manager or among his \xe2\x80\x9cdisciples\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Yet Mourinho also appears on Keane\xe2\x80\x99s radar as he reflected on being in the opposite dugout during a 3-0 defeat for Villa \xe2\x80\x93 and why he had deliberately snubbed the Portuguese when he offered his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t mind all that [mind games] but the game is still going on. It\xe2\x80\x99s disgraceful. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen him doing it to other managers; it is a disgrace.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Asked whether it was arrogant and disrespectful, Keane replied: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you think? That\xe2\x80\x99s a stupid question.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Keane was in no mood to be conciliatory as he alleged that former team-mates from Old Trafford had told \xe2\x80\x9clies and lies and lies\xe2\x80\x9d about him, but his real spite was reserved for Ferguson. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was never critical when we were winning trophies and he was getting his new contracts, getting this and that named after him \xe2\x80\x93 Sir this, and whatever else. He made millions of pounds out of it. He got his statues. He got his stand named after him. To criticise people who brought him success was just ridiculous.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Keane explained why he had refused to attend the unveiling of Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s statue at Old Trafford. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I did [get an invitation], yeah. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he invited me. It was probably his committee or his son or whatever, but why would I go to that? That was all power and control to him. So he comes in and we\xe2\x80\x99re all standing there [gesturing sycophantic applause] and he\xe2\x80\x99s: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve got you where I want you.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The former United captain also reflected on how Ferguson had withdrawn his loan players from Preston North End after his son, Darren, had been sacked as their manager \xe2\x80\x93 and how Stoke City, then managed by Pulis, had followed suit. \xe2\x80\x9c[Roberto] Mart\xc3\xadnez reckons he was misquoted a few years ago when he said Ferguson had his disciples. But he obviously does. When a manager takes players away from being on loan \xe2\x80\x93 I think it was Preston \xe2\x80\x93 when his son [Darren] got the sack. And, all of a sudden, all the players are being brought back from their loans.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>           The former Manchester United captain Roy Keane says he has not made peace with Sir Alex Ferguson since leaving the club in 2005 '
