b'Louis van Gaal: Manchester United will be my last job in management'


b'<p>Louis van Gaal has insisted that coaching Manchester United will be his last managerial role and he is determined to help them qualify for next season\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League.</p> <p>The Dutchman, 63, signed a three-year contract at Old Trafford in May before leading Holland to the semi-finals of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. The former Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich manager has since taken United to fourth place in the Premier League table ahead of Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s crucial trip to face fifth-placed Liverpool at Anfield.</p> <p>However, in an interview with the Daily Telegraph published on Thursday, Van Gaal admitted that he has already promised his wife that they will retire to the Algarve in the near future.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my last job. For sure,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have to pay attention to my kids, my grandchildren but also to my wife. They deserve it. Now I cannot pay that attention. I was not at the birthday of my grandson for example. I don\xe2\x80\x99t like it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>United\xe2\x80\x99s 3-0 win over Tottenham on Sunday was hailed as United\xe2\x80\x99s best performance since Van Gaal joined the club. It left them two points clear of Liverpool and a point behind third-placed Arsenal with just nine games of the season left to play.</p> <p>But while there has been criticism of the Dutchman\xe2\x80\x99s first season in the Premier League, Van Gaal believes the club is now beginning to see the fruits of his labour.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I drive my car for the first time in England it is the same, I have to think about the left and the right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat we have seen with United. Against Spurs you have seen that. That shows they can do things together as a team. That takes time. In Germany [at Bayern], it took until December. And now until March [with United].\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Manchester United face home matches against Aston Villa and Manchester City next month before successive trips to play Chelsea and Everton. They are also due to play Arsenal at Old Trafford on 16 May before rounding off the season at Hull.</p> <p>Van Gaal is confident they can finish in the top four and hinted that a Champions League spot could be crucial in attracting the calibre of player he wants.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s our goal, yes, and it depends on how we end this season,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to qualify for the Champions League and we have many tests next year. That also develops the level of your team, and of course how many players can come in to improve our selection.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
