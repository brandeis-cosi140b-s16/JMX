b'Chelsea manager Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho compares Diego Costa to Didier Drogba'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho believes Diego Costa is capable of mustering the \xe2\x80\x9csame profile of career\xe2\x80\x9d at Chelsea as Didier Drogba after the Spain international took his goal tally at his new club to seven in his first four matches with a devastating 22-minute hat-trick against Swansea.</p> <p>The home side came from a goal down to overwhelm the Welsh club and maintain their perfect start to the new campaign in the process, with the \xc2\xa332m signing from Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid becoming the first Chelsea player in 86 years to score in each of his first four games for the club. Lo\xc3\xafc R\xc3\xa9my, a late debutant, also scored to ensure Chelsea travel to Manchester City next Sunday already boasting a five-point advantage over the champions.</p> <p>Mourinho conceded Costa\xe2\x80\x99s productive start to the campaign had been a surprise but pointed to the Brazil-born forward\xe2\x80\x99s strength and power having already justified Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s patience in waiting to sign him rather than entering the market for an alternative target during the winter window last season.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf the team plays well, he has to score goals,\xe2\x80\x9d said the manager. \xe2\x80\x9cSeven goals in four Premier League matches is maybe a bit too much \xe2\x80\x93 we cannot expect him to have, say, 14 after eight games \xe2\x80\x93 but the way he\xe2\x80\x99s playing \xe2\x80\xa6 If he keeps scoring as he is, that will give us a chance to stay at the top.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe hasn\xe2\x80\x99t surprised me. Maybe seven in four has surprised me \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s not normal \xe2\x80\x93 but he\xe2\x80\x99s comfortable in the team. We were building the side in a way where we were waiting for a certain type of striker. I think everyone knows now why Chelsea did well to wait for Diego rather than buying someone else in the midwinter last season. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t want just to buy a striker. It is hard to compare with Didier. He started in 2004, 10 years ago, and had a fantastic career here. But Diego has shown he can have that same profile of career, yes.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Drogba, who missed this game with an ankle injury, will have his fitness assessed before Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s visit of Schalke in the Champions League. \xe2\x80\x9cThat group is more difficult than people think,\xe2\x80\x9d added Mourinho when asked about his team\xe2\x80\x99s prospects in Europe. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not because I\xe2\x80\x99m Portuguese, but the Portuguese teams are always very difficult. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a strong league, but the three top teams are very strong, very good. If you go to Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s history, when Chelsea play against Benfica or Porto it was difficult, so against Sporting [Lisbon], it\xe2\x80\x99ll be difficult.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe Germans are the Germans. Schalke have improved a lot since last season. I\xe2\x80\x99ve not analysed Maribor yet, as the last team we\xe2\x80\x99ll play against, but our group is difficult. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard. And we have [domestic] fixtures that are like a poisonous gift for us after European ties: we play City, Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool after Champions League games. So there are some difficult weeks ahead of us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
