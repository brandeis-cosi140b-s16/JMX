b"How will \xc3\x81ngel di Mar\xc3\xada compare with British football's record signings?"


b'<p>Manchester United have no excuses now. In the past 12 months they have spent \xc2\xa3195.3m on Marouane Fellaini, Juan Mata, Luke Shaw, Ander Herrera, Marcos Rojo and \xc3\x81ngel di Mar\xc3\xada. Their transfer record, which had stood since Dimitar Berbatov joined from Tottenham Hotspur on a crazy deadline day back in 2008, has been smashed twice in eight months.</p> <p>United are no strangers to extravagance. Sir Matt Busby made Denis Law the most expensive player in the history of British football in 1962; Ron Atkinson broke the transfer record to sign Bryan Robson in 1981; and Alex Ferguson edged that figure ever higher during his 26 years with the club. Now Louis van Gaal has made Di Mar\xc3\xada the most expensive player to grace the English game. How will he fare? Here is the formbook for record breaking transfers in the past 20 years. </p> 1) Fernando Torres, \xc2\xa350m, Liverpool to Chelsea, 2011     The increasingly surly Fernando Torres. Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA    <p>What was the view at the time?Some Liverpool fans found their way on to Sky Sports News and burned replica shirts to show how angry they were about the supposed betrayal from Torres but most supporters were left wondering if this could be an opportunity for the club. Mark Lawrenson summed up their mixed emotions well in an interview with the BBC. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not really possible for Liverpool to replace him but they might with two players and I think that\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely fine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lawrenson. \xe2\x80\x9cOn his day \xe2\x80\x93 and we have seen unbelievable days from him \xe2\x80\x93 he has been brilliant, as good as anyone in the world. But we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen him like that for a long time. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen flashes this season, but not too many. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bit like when King Kenny left. When he went I think we probably replaced him with about 10 as he was that good.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>How did he fare?As it happens, Liverpool did replace Torres with two players. On the day he left for Chelsea, the club signed Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez for \xc2\xa322.8m and Andy Carroll for \xc2\xa335m. Despite wasting \xc2\xa335m on Carroll, Liverpool did better from the deal than Torres, whose form has continued down the mournful road Lawrenson had foreseen at the time.</p> <p>Torres is still paid around \xc2\xa3160,000 a week by Chelsea (how crazy is that?) but he did not even make it on to the bench for their match against Leicester on Saturday. It\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassing and even a little sad to write this, but he is now more famous for his misses \xe2\x80\x93 examples A, B and C \xe2\x80\x93 than his goals. Type the word \xe2\x80\x9cTorres\xe2\x80\x9d into YouTube and the search engine will try to finish your sentence with the words \xe2\x80\x9cmisses open goal\xe2\x80\x9d. No wonder the man is short of confidence.</p> <p>What did he win?The FA Cup, the Champions League and the Europa League. </p> <p>Was the move a success or failure?Failure</p> 2) Robinho, \xc2\xa332.5m, Real Madrid to Manchester City, 2008     Robinho, who thought he was going to Chelsea but ended up at Manchester City. Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images    <p>What was the view at the time?Robinho wanted to join Chelsea in the summer of 2008 but the Manchester City owners had other ideas. When the \xc2\xa332.5m deal was finalised, Robinho told journalists he was off \xe2\x80\x9cto Chelsea\xe2\x80\x9d. The reporters corrected his mistake and he managed to express a modicum of excitement for the \xe2\x80\x9cproject\xe2\x80\x9d but, even on his first day, he never seemed truly animated about the his new job. \xe2\x80\x9cMany people think that Manchester City are not a big club at the moment, but I think the opposite,\xe2\x80\x9d said Robinho, somewhat unconvincingly. </p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe team don\xe2\x80\x99t yet have many titles, but they are beginning a project now. Four years ago, Chelsea were seen in the same way. Of course, my goal had been to go to Chelsea because they were the only club that had made a proposal to me. But there was a fight between Real Madrid and Chelsea. Chelsea made the mistake of putting my name on their shirt without having signed anything yet. This hurt the pride of Real Madrid. Also, Chelsea didn\xe2\x80\x99t reach the asking price.\xe2\x80\x9d </p> <p>How did he fare?Robinho served a purpose for City. He was a trailblazer who brought City to the attention of big players and their agents. He scored on his debut, knocked in a hat-trick against Stoke City a few weeks later and was even given the captaincy, but the love affair was fleeting. </p> <p>His interest drifted and his enthusiasm wilted. Craig Bellamy wrote in his autobiography that Robinho and his fellow countryman Elano \xe2\x80\x9cformed a Brazilian clique and didn\xe2\x80\x99t give a shit. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t train with any intensity and if you tackled one of them, it was like you had committed a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d Robinho would probably disagree with that assessment, but when he swapped City for a loan spell at Santos he admitted that his Brazilian style was incompatible with English football. </p> <p>He left the club after 18 months, having played 41 games and scored 14 goals. By then City had moved on, with Carlos T\xc3\xa9vez and Emmanuel Adebayor now scoring their goals and causing their problems.</p> <p>What did he win?Nothing</p> <p>Was the move a success or a failure?Failure</p> 3) Andriy Shevchenko, \xc2\xa330.8m, AC Milan to Chelsea, 2006     Andriy Shevchenko and Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho not seeing eye to eye. Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian    <p>What was the view at the time?Andriy Shevchenko won the Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or in 2004, two years before Roman Abramovich brought him to Chelsea. Shevchenko had been a frighteningly quick striker at Dynamo Kyiv, for whom he once scored a first-half hat-trick against Barcelona, and then he had improved at Milan, where he scored 127 goals in 208 appearances on his way to winning the Serie A title, the Champions League and the Coppa Italia. He should have been a success at Chelsea, but ... </p> <p>How did he fare?Shevchenko is Milan\xe2\x80\x99s second highest goalscorer in their history, but he only scored nine league goals in three seasons at Chelsea. He is almost apologetic about it: \xe2\x80\x9cI left Milan when I was nearly 30 years old, and I had won everything. When I arrived at Chelsea, everyone expected me to repeat the same performances but that was impossible. I suffered many injuries and many other things. Chelsea rarely wanted to play with two strikers. Like it or not, criticism from people is part of our job, our world. Without all these endless discussions, football would not be football.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>What did he win?The FA Cup and the League Cup</p> <p>Was the move a success or failure?Failure</p> 4) Rio Ferdinand, \xc2\xa329.1m, Leeds to Manchester United, 2002     Alex Ferguson keeps his hand firmly in his pocket as Rio Ferdinand signs for Manchester United in an awful suit. Photograph: Darren Walsh/Action Images    <p>What was the view at the time?Spending \xc2\xa329.1m on a defender would be a big deal in 2014. Twelve years ago, the transfer fee was huge. Leeds were in need of some money, with debts of around \xc2\xa378m, and even their manager, Terry Venables, admitted the the offer was \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps impossible to turn down\xe2\x80\x9d. </p> <p>Venables did not want to lose his captain but Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale could not refuse the cash: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen your captain says he wants to leave you have to listen. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got the best price available I\xe2\x80\x99m satisfied I\xe2\x80\x99ve done the best job for Leeds United. If you invest \xc2\xa318m and get \xc2\xa330m you\xe2\x80\x99ve done a good job \xe2\x80\x93 especially if the player says he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to play for you again. He\xe2\x80\x99s a great player and a nice lad and I\xe2\x80\x99m sad he\xe2\x80\x99s leaving, but he\xe2\x80\x99ll go with our best wishes and we\xe2\x80\x99ll spend the money wisely.\xe2\x80\x9d </p> <p>How did he fare?Harry Redknapp, the West Ham manager who had sold Ferdinand to Leeds, had an interesting take on his transfer to Manchester United: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Leeds came in with their offer, we couldn\xe2\x80\x99t turn it down. Money like that enabled a club like West Ham to rebuild with a couple of players. Now Manchester United have done the same to Leeds. That\xe2\x80\x99s the name of the game, I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid. There\xe2\x80\x99s always a bigger fish out there somewhere waiting to pounce. I always knew he would go to the top and he has. He\xe2\x80\x99s at the top now with Manchester United. He\xe2\x80\x99s without doubt the best defender in Europe, if not the world.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Redknapp was not far wrong. Aside from the odd lapse in concentration in his early years and the eight-month ban for missing a drugs test, Ferdinand proved to be one of the best defenders in world football. His elegance combined perfectly with Nemanja Vidic\xe2\x80\x99s relentless desire to win the ball and the pair led the club to three European Cup finals in four seasons. </p> <p>What did he win?Six Premier League titles, two League Cups, the Champions League and the Fifa Club World Cup.</p> <p>Was the move a success or failure?Success</p> 5) Juan Sebasti\xc3\xa1n Ver\xc3\xb3n, \xc2\xa328m, Lazio to Manchester United, 2001     Juan Sebasti\xc3\xa1n Ver\xc3\xb3n and Alex Ferguson wear Manchester United scarves at his unveiling. Photograph: Gary M Prior/Getty Images    <p>What was the view at the time?Contrary to popular belief, Paul Scholes did speak before he began working for every organ of the media in his retirement. Back in September 2001, when Ver\xc3\xb3n had been at United for a few months, Scholes was asked to compare his new team-mate with Eric Cantona. \xe2\x80\x9cIn terms of his all-round game, I think he\xe2\x80\x99ll do more than Eric has done,\xe2\x80\x9d said Scholes. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure he will have more of an influence on the team but he\xe2\x80\x99s just a better player. Don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong, I think Eric was amazing but I think Juan has just a bit more. He\xe2\x80\x99s involved in the game all the time. He can create and score goals. He can just do anything.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>How did he fare?Not as well as Paul Scholes had predicted. Ver\xc3\xb3n was the old Dimitar Berbatov. A decade before Manchester United fans debated the merits of Berbatov, they had the same arguments about Veron \xe2\x80\x93 is he lazy or in possession of an insouciant cool? Does he slow the team down or add tactical control? Is he what the team need in Europe or their weakness in the league? In the end, he went the same was as Berbatov. Alex Ferguson lost patience with him and sent him off to west London at a reduced price. </p> <p>What did he win?The Premier League</p> <p>Was the move a success or failure?Failure</p> 6) Alan Shearer, \xc2\xa315m, Blackburn Rovers to Newcastle United, 1996     Alan Shearer practices his goal celebration as he is introduced to the Newcastle United fans. Photograph: Paul Barker/PA    <p>What was the view at the time?Newcastle paid Blackburn \xc2\xa31.7m more for Alan Shearer than Barcelona had just paid to take Ronaldo from PSV Eindhoven to the Nou Camp. They made Shearer the most expensive footballer in the history of the game. And the locals loved it. The club ran out of letters as their fans lined up to have the No9 emblazoned on the back of their shirts.</p> <p>Kevin Keegan addressed the media from Bangkok, where Newcastle were playing the Thailand national team as part of their summer tour, and he was full of beans. \xe2\x80\x9cThis signing is for the people of Newcastle,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Keegan. \xe2\x80\x9cIt just shows you the ambition of Newcastle United. We are the biggest thinking team in Europe now. We\xe2\x80\x99re not the biggest, most successful team, but we\xe2\x80\x99re the biggest thinking club and we have tremendous support from above which allows me to buy players.\xe2\x80\x9d </p> <p>How did he fare?Shearer scored 25 league goals in his first season with Newcastle and remained prolific until his retirement in 2006. He is still the top scorer in the Premier League, with his remarkable total of 260 goals considerably higher than that of any other player. Andrew Cole is second in that all-time list, a full 73 goals behind Shearer. Only nine players have scored half as many Premier League goals as Shearer managed. </p> <p>What did he win?Nothing</p> <p>Was the move a success or failure?Success</p> 7) Stan Collymore, \xc2\xa38.5m, Nottingham Forest to Liverpool, 1995     Stan Collymore scores Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s winning goal in their 4-3 win over Newcastle United at Anfield in 1996. Photograph: David Kendall/PA    <p>What was the view at the time?As Liverpool and Everton battled it out to sign Stan Collymore, newspaper columnists fretted about the gross wages football clubs were willing to pay players. Collymore was to earn \xc2\xa313,000 a week and the punditocracy wondered where it would end. The more things change, the more they stay the same. </p> <p>Collymore said he chose Liverpool over Everton for footballing and not financial reasons, telling Joe Royle that he had friends at the club. \xe2\x80\x9cAs I understand it, it just comes down to the fact that he knows some of the other players over at Anfield,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Everton manager. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a personal thing. There is no ill feeling and I wish him well.\xe2\x80\x9d </p> <p>Roy Evans thought his masterplan was coming together \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cStan is another piece in my jigsaw but at these prices I can\xe2\x80\x99t afford too many more pieces\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 and Collymore did his best not to think about the money. \xe2\x80\x9cLiverpool bought me to play football on the pitch, not to run around saying \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m an \xc2\xa38.5m footballer\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, while petitioning Nottingham Forest to cough up the 5% of the transfer fee he thought was owed.</p> <p>How did he fare?Things are always complicated with Collymore. He scored 28 goals in 64 appearances for Liverpool, which is a respectable figure for any striker but, despite having all those friends at Liverpool, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t settle well at the club. He missed training sessions. He sulked. And he had \xe2\x80\x9creasonably loud sex\xe2\x80\x9d with the boss\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. </p> <p>Neil Ruddock says Collymore could have been a world-beater, but in the end Liverpool were happy to let him go to Aston Villa after two season: \xe2\x80\x9cStan didn\xe2\x80\x99t make any attempt to get on with the lads and, although I used to sit next to him on the coach and try and make conversation with him, I could never claim to know him,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Ruddock in his autobiography. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody did. He\xe2\x80\x99d turn up for training, do his work, get changed and go home. Not exactly conducive to good team spirit, so I think most of the lads were relieved when he was finally flogged off to Aston Villa.\xe2\x80\x9d </p> <p>What did he win?Nothing</p> <p>Was the move a success or failure?Failure</p> 8) Dennis Bergkamp, \xc2\xa37.5m, Internazionale to Arsenal, 1995     Bruce Rioch poses with Dennis Bergkamp, the first player he bought as Arsenal manager. Photograph: Tony Harris/PA    <p>What was the view at the time?Dennis Bergkamp failed at Internazionale. But he was never going to succeed. Bergkamp, this product of Dutch total football who was raised by Johan Cruyff to prize the assist over the goal, ended up in a team led by Osvaldo Bagnoli, a coach who believed that the quickest way to the goal was the most efficient: \xe2\x80\x9cI used to say to the players: the fewer passes you make the better it is,\xe2\x80\x9d says Bagnoli of his tactics at Internationale. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like tick-tock football. I used to say even to the goalkeeper: if you have the ball and see the forward is free then give him the ball.\xe2\x80\x9d </p> <p>Bergkamp was an island: a collaborator in a team that wanted to play the long ball. His strike partner, Ruben Sosa, was an individualist who attacked on his own. Bergkamp was on the outside. So he left for Bruce Rioch\xe2\x80\x99s Arsenal. </p> <p>The relationship was perfect from the start. At his unveiling the club broadcast a little video of his best goals and assists, with This Is The One by the Stone Roses providing the soundtrack. He liked that. When he went on to the pitch for the press photographs, the head groundsman placed him on a wooden plank so he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t harm the grass. He loved that. When he went back to his hotel, he saw the story BERGKAMP JOINS ARSENAL was on pages 301 and 302 of Ceefax. That blew him away. He had found a home.</p> <p>How did he fare?They built him a statue.</p> <p>What did he win?Three Premier League titles and four FA Cups.</p> <p>Was the move a success or failure?Success</p> 9) Andy Cole, \xc2\xa37m, Newcastle United to Manchester United, 1995     Alex Ferguson gives Andy Cole his first Manchester United shirt in January 1995. Photograph: David Kendall/PA    <p>What was the view at the time?When Rob Lee noticed that Andrew Cole was missing from Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s training session he thought his team-mate \xe2\x80\x9cwas off on one of his London trips\xe2\x80\x9d. In fact Cole was signing for Manchester United, a move that would break the British transfer record and leave a defensive Kevin Keegan arguing with angry fans on the steps of St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park. </p> <p>Mark Hughes was on the wrong side of 30 and Manchester United needed fresh legs up front so Alex Ferguson set about finding a new striker. He called Nottingham Forest manager Frank Clark to enquire about Stan Collymore\xe2\x80\x99s availability, but Clark had gone home with flu. So Ferguson turned his attention to Cole, whose relationship with Keegan had soured after a debate about his intensity in traning. Collymore heard rumours that Cole was signing for United and tried to contact his agent, Paul Stretford. Unfortunately for Collymore, Stretford was also Cole\xe2\x80\x99s agent and by the time his calls were answered, Cole was on his way to Manchester and Stretford was on his way to the bank. </p> <p>How did he fare?Cole scored 93 goals in 195 appearances for Manchester United but he will always be remembered for his partnership with Dwight Yorke. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we started playing together, it was like meeting a special woman and falling in love,\xe2\x80\x9d recalled Cole in an interview with FourFourTwo. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything felt right. We never had a cross word. Our confidence soared and we thought we\xe2\x80\x99d score every week. If one of us didn\xe2\x80\x99t score, the other would. We could alter our play depending on the opposition: I\xe2\x80\x99d go long, he\xe2\x80\x99d go short. Nobody knew how to mark us. At times, we had so much space that we took liberties.\xe2\x80\x9d The pair scored 53 goals betwen them in United\xe2\x80\x99s most successful season ever, including these beauties against Barcelona in the Champions League. </p> <p>What did he win?Five Premier League titles, two FA Cups and the Champions League.</p> <p>Was the move a success or failure?Success</p>'
