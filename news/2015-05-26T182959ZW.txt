b'Watford\xe2\x80\x99s contract talks with manager Slavisa Jokanovic break down'


b'<p>Watford are looking for their fifth manager since last August after talks with Slavisa Jokanovic, the Serb who led the club to promotion to the Premier League but whose contract expires this summer, broke down over his wage demands.</p> <p>The club have opened negotiations with Quique Flores, the former Valencia and Real Madrid right-back who has coached widely in Spain and Portugal. However, since leaving Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid four years ago his CV features only two spells in the UAE and six weeks at Getafe earlier this year.</p> <p>Despite the alacrity with which Watford have switched coaches over the last 10 months the club were not planning another change and offered Jokanovic a significant pay rise to oversee the return of Premier League football to Vicarage Road. The offer was refused, with the former Chelsea midfielder asking for the suggested salary to be nearly trebled. Gino Pozzo, the Hertfordshire club\xe2\x80\x99s owner, displayed his lack of sentimentality by removing Billy McKinlay after eight days in charge in order to appoint Jokanovic last October and has refused to amend his budget despite the team\xe2\x80\x99s impressive performances during the Championship run-in.</p> <p>A return to the negotiating table is not impossible but is considered unlikely. Towards the end of the season Jokanovic insisted he wanted to remain in England. \xe2\x80\x9cI am very happy here and it is a great place,\xe2\x80\x9d he said last month. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you ask me where I would prefer to be, I can be very happy working next season here at Watford. It will be very interesting and very important for me to stay here to try to build a stronger team than we have now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>His situation is complicated by the fact that his family have remained in Spain, though they may relocate should Jokanovic secure a long-term contract in England. Since Watford\xe2\x80\x99s promotion charge transformed his reputation in this country, Jokanovic has been linked with several clubs, including Sunderland and Newcastle.</p>'
