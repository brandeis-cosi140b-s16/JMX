b'Football transfer rumours: Juventus to sign Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Glen Johnson?'


b'<p>Italy is fast becoming a safe haven for England\xe2\x80\x99s full-backs. Ashley Cole couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a look in at Chelsea last season and jumped ship to Roma in the summer. He\xe2\x80\x99s looking right at home (even if, at the age of 33, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got the hang of the suit-and-tie thing they\xe2\x80\x99ve got going on over there). Micah Richards packed some last-minute luggage and made haste to Fiorentina after hearing they were actually willing to let him on a competitive football pitch. Now Glen Johnson is considering a switch to Juventus, much to the dismay of many Liverpool fans.</p> <p>Johnson is out of contract club in the summer, but instead of leaving Liverpool on a free, could be sold on the cheap in January, with the manager Brendan Rodgers reportedly keen to get his \xc2\xa3110,000-a-week wages off the books. With Alberto Moreno emerging as first-choice at left-back, Javi Manquillo at right-back, and with Jon Flanagan set to return from injury, Johnson could already be considered surplus to requirements.</p> <p>Nigel de Jong also doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave Italia, and has turned his nose up at Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s Oranje revolution/Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s start to the season, insisting that he\xe2\x80\x99d rather carry on swilling red wine with Pippo Inzaghi at his current club Milan. They haven\xe2\x80\x99t had much luck tempting Juan Cuadrado from Fiorentina either, he\xe2\x80\x99s set to sign a new contract with La Viola.</p> <p>If you thought the Rumour Mill was putting it\xe2\x80\x99s feet up after a busy August, think again! There\xe2\x80\x99s always free transfers people! Last week we brought you Andrew Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s messianic return to Crystal Palace last week \xe2\x80\x93 whammy! \xe2\x80\x93 this time around we\xe2\x80\x99re serving up V\xc3\xadctor Vald\xc3\xa9s, who is poised to join Rodgers and co on Merseyside \xe2\x80\x93 Kaboom!</p> <p>Vald\xc3\xa9s, who is a free agent having ran down his contract with Barcelona, is currently sidelined as he recovers from cruciate ligament damage. He is thought to be nearing full fitness though, and could undergo a medical as early as next month, with Liverpool keen to add competition to their current No1, Simon Mignolet.</p> <p>Queens Park Rangers could also move for freebie Gaby Mudingayi \xe2\x80\x93 the Belgian midfielder is available for \xc2\xa30 after being released by Internazionale.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Blackburn and Bolton are fighting it out for the loan signature of Hull\xe2\x80\x99s Harry Maguire while West Ham could return for Stuttgart\xe2\x80\x99s Vedad Ibisevic, after seeing a bid rejected for him in the summer. \xe2\x80\x9cI stayed, but you never know. If a good offer comes in, I may leave,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ibisevic. \xe2\x80\x9cStuttgart has made some changes and the goal is a mid-table position. I have bigger ambitions [than that] so that is why I say I may yet leave,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, without realising that a mid-table finish with West Ham is the very most he could hope for in England.</p>'
