b'<p>Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas has told Sergio Ramos that if he has anything to say about him in future he should say it to his face.</p> <p>Ramos had questioned the commitment of his Spanish team-mates to the national cause, comments widely interpreted as criticism of Fabregas and his Chelsea team-mate Diego Costa who did not make the recent Spain squad for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Belarus because of hamstring injuries.</p> <p>Fabregas was ruled out by Spain\xe2\x80\x99s medical staff while Costa was rested by the coach Vicente del Bosque after a constant struggle this season to prove his fitness, though both played in the first game back after the international break, the 2-0 victory against West Brom at the weekend in which Costa scored the opening goal.</p> <p>Ramos said at the time that: \xe2\x80\x9cLaying out rules is difficult. Often with injuries there can be a world of difference between what we have and what is said in public.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAbove all I would have liked the players to show the same commitment to the national team as they do to their club. You must communicate this commitment and spirit to all the new players.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Fabregas responded on Tuesday night when he told the late-night Spanish radio show, El Partido de las Doce on the Cadena Cope station, that he had felt annoyed and offended by the Real Madrid defender\xe2\x80\x99s comments.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI told Ramos at the time that if he has something to say to me then he should pick up the phone and call and not send messages via the media,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p>     Ramos trains under the eye of Spain\xe2\x80\x99s coach Vicente del Bosque.

We eventually spoke on the phone and all is fine.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt really irked me that my level of compromise was doubted. I\xe2\x80\x99ve played many times and been involved in call-ups without playing.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve played 94 games for Spain over the past nine years and have always shown up... always and always in good faith. I had tendinitis in my left hamstring.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He referred to the Real Madrid midfielder Luka Modric who will be out for three months after picking up a thigh injury while playing for Croatia. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I played I could have ended up with an injury not to dissimilar to that of Modric,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI spoke with Del Bosque and all was fine. He\xe2\x80\x99s an ex-player and used to these situations.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
