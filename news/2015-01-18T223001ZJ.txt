b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts turn to Anfield after Chelsea trounce Swansea'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho believes no team will ever do the quadruple, but it will not stop him going for a clean sweep of all four major competitions with Chelsea this season, starting with the Capital One Cup.</p> <p>Mourinho has unfinished business with Liverpool, who are Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s opponents at Anfield on Tuesday night in the first leg of their semi-final.</p> <p>No sooner had his Premier League leaders consolidated their position at the top by thrashing Swansea than the manager turned his attention to Liverpool, who he has never forgiven for denying his team a place in the 2005 European Cup final with what he calls a \xe2\x80\x9cghost\xe2\x80\x9d goal by Luis Garc\xc3\xada.</p> <p>Ten years is a long time, but Mourinho still harbours a grievance. He said: \xe2\x80\x9cAnfield is an historic stadium and everybody likes to play there. I like it but I have difficult memories. Losing a Champions League semi-final to a goal that didn\xe2\x80\x99t cross the line will stay in my mind for ever, I cannot forget it. It still hurts, of course it does, and in the Capital One Cup there is no goalline technology, so we are not free from it happening again.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>A decade on, Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s class of 2015 were in imperious form at the Liberty Stadium, Mourinho describing their performance as \xe2\x80\x9cperfect\xe2\x80\x9d. So could his team win everything? \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible for anyone. But it is possible to play for it and to motivate yourself with it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The European Cup was the ultimate objective, Mourinho insisting greatness would elude this team and that they would be forgotten in 20 years time if they did not win it.</p> <p>On this form you would not bet against it. Chelsea have been vulnerable on their travels of late but they outclassed Swansea to a startling degree and would not have been flattered by an 8-0 margin \xe2\x80\x93 Willian struck the framework of the goal twice with Lukasz Fabianski beaten.</p> <p>The Swans contributed to their own downfall to a ridiculous degree, gifting possession for two of the goals in a performance Garry Monk rightly described as \xe2\x80\x9chorrible\xe2\x80\x9d, but Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s finishing was of the highest order and they were obvious winners from the very first minute, when Gylfi Sigurdsson\xe2\x80\x99s stray pass allowed Oscar to score from the edge of the D.</p> <p>Diego Costa struck from near the penalty spot in the 20th minute and with Swansea overrun in midfield, where they were without Jonjo Shelvey, Leon Britton and Ki Sung-yueng, what followed was purely a question of arithmetic. Costa brought his personal tally to 17 in 19 league appearances after intercepting a woeful backpass by Frederico Fern\xc3\xa1ndez and Oscar\xe2\x80\x99s second, from 18 yards, made it 4-0 before half-time.</p> <p>To Welsh relief Chelsea eased up in the second half, with one eye already on Anfield, and they scored just one more, from substitute Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle.</p> <p>For Swansea it was a chastening, demoralising experience. A top 10 finish has always been their target, but there was talk of Europe as recently as the beginning of December, when they were only a point behind Arsenal, who were sixth. Now, however, two wins in their last eight in the League leaves them with as many defeats as victories and the departure of Wilfried Bony does not augur well.</p> <p>They need his replacement as principal striker, Baf\xc3\xa9timbi Gomis, to come good sooner rather than later, but on Saturday he was peripheral figure, starved of possession.</p> <p>Chelsea have no such problems and John Terry, their long-serving captain, who moved ahead of Frank Lampard in the all-time appearances list [649], said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve lost a couple away from home but in the first half our football and the goals was some of the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve known. Me and Gaz [Gary Cahill] felt like we weren\xe2\x80\x99t doing anything. We were just applauding what was going on in front of us. It was a delight to see.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAt this stage to be in all the competitions is where you want to be. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s down to the big players [he included himself] to step up and let everyone else decide, once we win stuff, how good a side we are.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPersonally, I\xe2\x80\x99m delighted to go above Lamps today and to be third in the all-time list. It\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hard to catch the top two [Ron Harris on 795 and Peter Bonetti on 729], but I\xe2\x80\x99m happy to be where I am. The next target is The Cat [goalkeeper Bonetti]. We always joke about it when I see him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Man of the match Oscar (Chelsea)</p>'
