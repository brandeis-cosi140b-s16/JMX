b'Manchester United are aiming for title not fourth, says Louis van Gaal'


b'<p>Louis van Gaal has insisted that Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s goal is to claim the Premier League title, despite the 10-point gap to Chelsea and the Old Trafford board setting a target of only a top-four finish.</p> <p>United\xe2\x80\x99s 1-1 draw at Aston Villa on Saturday halted a run of six consecutive victories and left them 10 points behind Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side. Yet Van Gaal believes the championship can be won in his opening season in charge.</p> <p>He said: \xe2\x80\x9cThe best achievement is champion because our goal is still to be champions at the end of the season \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s also the best result. We are looking in a football world where number one is the most important thing. Our goal is to be first. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not always so easy, you can see that. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the board have said that our goal is within the first four places but still, with my players and all the staff, we are trying to achieve more than they expect from us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Gaal is clear that being top on Christmas Day means nothing. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the Netherlands and also in Germany you have the Christmas champions but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t count \xe2\x80\x93 at the end of May or June, then you have to be first,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn Holland and Germany we have a Christmas champion \xe2\x80\x93 PSV and Bayern Munich are the Christmas champions [this year]. It\xe2\x80\x99s better to be the Christmas champions then the possibility you shall be next champion is bigger but not certain.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>United host Newcastle United on Boxing Day and Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s Alan Pardew, is one of many managers in the Premier League who like to occupy the technical area. Van Gaal, however, prefers to sit down throughout a match.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see any influence from me when I am there shouting,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are not understanding you \xe2\x80\x93 maybe one individual player [is]. [But] when you change one individual position that has also an influence on other positions. So I have trained the whole week that players read the situations.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes they can\xe2\x80\x99t read that but then you have half-time or you have a change [a substitution to do so]. Then you can say to the player who is coming on to the pitch how they have to play in their positions. You have to transfer that. With the fans in the Premier League shouting so much, they can\xe2\x80\x99t understand you. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m always on the bench.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou have trained them to read the game by themselves. It is much more important that they are more involved with the game, that they make their own decisions. It is like a child, you educate.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Asked why Pardew and other managers use the technical area, Van Gaal said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to ask them. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have the idea that you can influence a game by shouting from the sidelines. Sometimes I\xe2\x80\x99m doing that but that\xe2\x80\x99s more emotional than the content is heard by the players.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes players can\xe2\x80\x99t read the match, it\xe2\x80\x99s not their quality [strength]. I have players who can read the match very well but there are others who cannot read the match for the team. For themselves they can read the match but for the team it is more difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pardew has clashed with Manuel Pellegrini and Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger when in the vicinity of the technical area. \xe2\x80\x9cI have never had a fight,\xe2\x80\x9d Van Gaal said. \xe2\x80\x9cI only use my voice, never my hands or something like that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Gaal would not be drawn on whether some managers hope to influence the referee when in the technical area. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can influence the referee, no. When I was in my first year I did everything. But I learned to be more quiet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, before dismissing whether Sir Alex Ferguson used to try to affect the officials at the end of games by standing and pointing at his watch in what became know as an attempt to gain \xe2\x80\x9cFergie-time\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>The 63-year-old said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou think the referee is looking at Ferguson? On television you can see that because every television station is recording the manager, I know. But the referee is not looking at the television. Maybe after the match, but then he can\xe2\x80\x99t change anything any more.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>While seated Van Gaal often writes notes. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is for half-time. I can say the things that I am willing to say that can influence the match. Then the sequence is always the right way because the players remember the moments of the game in sequence. It\xe2\x80\x99s more efficient then.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of whether Adnan Januzaj may be allowed to go on loan in January, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t discuss that with you. You are not the CEO when it\xe2\x80\x99s like that. I am not suggesting it\xe2\x80\x99s like that.\xe2\x80\x9d Might the 19-year-old benefit from the experience? \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a player of United,\xe2\x80\x9d said the manager.</p>'
