b'Meet the 93-year-old Reading fan whose dislike of Arsenal dates to the 1920s'


b'<p>Ciss Platten takes it steady as she walks to the solitary Reading supporters\xe2\x80\x99 coach, parked outside the Madejski Stadium and bound for Blackpool. At 93 years old, you tend to go at your own pace.</p> <p>Yet despite the aid of a walking stick \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cI hate it,\xe2\x80\x9d Platten says \xe2\x80\x93 she remains fiercely independent. And loyally following Reading, at home and far away, is her all-consuming passion.</p> <p>Platten will be the only Reading fan at Wembley who was alive when the then Biscuitmen last reached the FA Cup semi-finals. In 1927 they lost 3-0 to the eventual winners, Cardiff City, at Molineux.</p> <p>On Saturday, 88 years on, the club \xe2\x80\x93 now the Royals \xe2\x80\x93 revisit the last four. Platten will be there; she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be anywhere else.</p> <p>For her, that the opponents are Arsenal has added extra spice to the tie. She is not the greatest admirer of the north London team nor of their manager, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger, a notoriously poor loser. \xe2\x80\x9cWe call him \xe2\x80\x98Ars\xc3\xa8ne Whinger\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d Platten says. \xe2\x80\x9cFunny thing, it was in the paper the other day \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x98Whinger\xe2\x80\x99. He\xe2\x80\x99s always whinging, he\xe2\x80\x99s always having a moan.\xe2\x80\x9d Platten laughs mischievously. As she does a lot.</p> <p>Yet her distaste for all things Arsenal runs a bit deeper, right back to the late 1920s. Blame her father, Arthur. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t really know about football then but dad used to stand by the window on a Sunday morning checking his Pools coupon,\xe2\x80\x9d Platten says. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he\xe2\x80\x99d say: \xe2\x80\x98Bloody hell, Arsenal have let me down again.\xe2\x80\x99</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe was always grumbling about them. \xe2\x80\x98That blasted team\xe2\x80\x99 he called them. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s maybe why I\xe2\x80\x99ve always disliked Arsenal.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In 1927, Platten was six years old and growing up in Sussex, near Arundel. At 14, she began work in a large country house. \xe2\x80\x9cI left school on the Friday,\xe2\x80\x9d she recalls, \xe2\x80\x9cand was shoved into \xe2\x80\x98service\xe2\x80\x99 on the Monday as a parlour maid. I used to get up at 5am every morning and did everything. And we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have Hoovers in those days. It was just a dustpan and brush.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the cook went on holiday, I cooked as well. I was only 15. But I did do a nice roast and also pastries. It put you in good stead for when you got married. Kids don\xe2\x80\x99t know what work is these days.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It is a theme that Platten warms to, chuckling away. She still has a one-day-a-week job close to her home in Shiplake, near Henley-on-Thames, in south Oxfordshire.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cJust a bit of dusting and cleaning the brass,\xe2\x80\x9d she explains. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a nice bit of pocket money, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give it up. Some old people just sit around all day doing nothing. I can\xe2\x80\x99t do that, I do all my own housework. And I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want a carer.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Tony Taylor is one of Platten\xe2\x80\x99s regular \xe2\x80\x9cchauffeurs\xe2\x80\x9d for away matches, picking her up in Shiplake and taking her to the Madejski Stadium to catch the supporters\xe2\x80\x99 coach to wherever. And then taking her home on the late-night arrival back at the MadStad.</p> <p>On Tuesday last week, it was off to Blackpool at Bloomfield Road. Just the 483-mile round trip for an essentially meaningless Championship fixture, which finished in a dismal 1-1 draw.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI dropped Ciss back home at about 3am,\xe2\x80\x9d Taylor, a 68-year-old retired teacher and fellow Reading die-hard, says. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd she said: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be up for 8.30.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of course, naturally. Wednesday is cleaning day.</p>     Reading\xe2\x80\x99s captain, Robert \xe2\x80\x98Bert\xe2\x80\x99 Eggo, right, shakes hands with his Cardiff City counterpart, Fred Keenor, before the 1927 FA Cup semi-final at Molineux. Photograph: Davis/Getty Images    <p>Platten moved to the Reading area with her husband, John, in the late 1940s. They had six children \xe2\x80\x93 Janet, Sylvia, Anthony, David, Terry and Christopher. Ciss has outlived Sylvia, Anthony and John, who died 21 years ago, and has 16 grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd two great\xe2\x80\x91greats as well,\xe2\x80\x9d she says.</p> <p>At about 45 years old \xe2\x80\x93 when the older children had grown up and could look after the \xe2\x80\x9clittle ones\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 her love affair with Reading, at their former Elm Park ground, began.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy husband used to go there,\xe2\x80\x9d Platten says, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99d say to him: \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why you stand in the wet and cold watching that.\xe2\x80\x99 He got fed up with me going on then, one day, he said: \xe2\x80\x98Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you come along with me?\xe2\x80\x99 So I went to Elm Park \xe2\x80\xa6 and that was it.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe then got old and miserable and wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go to the away games. So I said: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not stopping in.\xe2\x80\x99 I used to leave his food ready for him and I\xe2\x80\x99d just go.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Platten worked as a matchday programme seller at Elm Park until the age of 79. \xe2\x80\x9cSeveral people would let you keep the change,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could make quite a bit extra really. But after counting up the money, I\xe2\x80\x99d only see the last 20 minutes of the first half. I missed a lot of goals, which was awful.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>On her 80th birthday, in 2001, Ciss went to the Second Division play-off final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, when Reading lost 3-2 to Walsall after extra time. She has attended all Reading\xe2\x80\x99s big days out over the past 50 years, including the 4-1 victory over Luton Town in the 1988 Simod Cup final at the old Wembley. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was great, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of my best memories.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Concerts by Daniel O\xe2\x80\x99Donnell, the Irish singer, occasionally distract Ciss. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the only one I\xe2\x80\x99ll miss Reading for,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe go to see him in Ireland. He\xe2\x80\x99s lovely.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Injury kept her in hospital for five weeks during Reading\xe2\x80\x99s first stint in the Premier League nine years ago, when she broke her right hip in a fall at home.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the ambulance arrived and they got me on a stretcher, I was really groaning,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cThis lad said to me: \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x99 I said: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m going to miss the games against Chelsea, Man Utd and Arsenal.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Platten has not missed a minute of this season\xe2\x80\x99s historic Cup run, on the road at Huddersfield Town, Cardiff City, Derby County and Bradford City, or the 3-0 home win over Bradford in the quarter-final replay.</p> <p>If the apparently inevitable occurs and Arsenal win on Saturday, Platten will just shrug it off and keep on watching the Royals. She has her sights set on 100 not out. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be great if we could do it,\xe2\x80\x9d she says of beating Arsenal. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got a chance. A lot of our fans just don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough faith in their team. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a great goalkeeper [Adam Federici] and if the others help him, which they don\xe2\x80\x99t sometimes, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be all right.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll carry on following Reading until I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it any more. Do you think I\xe2\x80\x99ll still be doing this at 100? I hope so. I never think: \xe2\x80\x98Oh, I can\xe2\x80\x99t be bothered today.\xe2\x80\x99 I can\xe2\x80\x99t wait for the next game. It would be awful if I ever overslept.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The Cup is full of fairy tales, the clich\xc3\xa9d romance but it might be somehow fitting if Reading did overcome Arsenal and reach the final on 30 May \xe2\x80\x93 three days after Platten\xe2\x80\x99s 94th birthday.</p> <p>And if, in the aftermath of defeat, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Whinger reverts to moaning mode, Platten will savour the moment even more.</p> <p>Mischievous giggles will be heard all the way back down the M4. And all the way back up again for the final.</p>'
