b'Everton 1-1 West Ham United | FA Cup third-round match report'


b'<p>It may prove a turning point or merely a temporary reprieve, but Romelu Lukaku\xe2\x80\x99s 91st-minute equaliser against West Ham United felt like victory to Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez. With good reason. Everton were staring at a potent combination of an eighth defeat in 10 matches, an early Cup exit and another round of scrutiny on their drained manager and then his \xc2\xa328m record signing halted the rot. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been a horrendous setback but the players showed they are ready to fight for everything,\xe2\x80\x9d said a relieved Everton manager.</p> <p>Mart\xc3\xadnez invested the bulk of Everton\xe2\x80\x99s summer budget on the Belgium international and was repaid when he needed it most, Lukaku capping arguably his best performance of the season by cancelling out James Collins\xe2\x80\x99 commanding header. The former Chelsea striker has scored in his past four appearances against West Ham. \xe2\x80\x9cA rash moment cost us the victory,\xe2\x80\x9d lamented Sam Allardyce. \xe2\x80\x9cWinston Reid and Joey O\xe2\x80\x99Brien dived in and that damned man scored against us again. As he always does.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>By comparison with last season, Everton\xe2\x80\x99s flaws were again glaring and the panic that spread around Goodison Park following Lukaku\xe2\x80\x99s leveller betrayed the lack of confidence in the team. By comparison with recent displays, however, and the four consecutive league defeats that have soured Everton\xe2\x80\x99s season, the fight and the first-half creativity was a reassuring step forward for Mart\xc3\xadnez. This was not a side refusing to play for the manager.</p> <p>The Everton manager, who looks gaunt and shattered after a dreadful festive period, conceded: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are still in a very bad run and need to turn it around. But this goal can have a huge effect. We finally got the reward our efforts deserved and that has been rare in the last few games.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The home side created the clearer chances but with West Ham pushing for victory throughout and Stewart Downing often dictating play from central midfield, the teams produced an open, flowing cup tie. Injuries to Andy Carroll and Diafra Sakho, who will miss the Africa Cup of Nations with a back injury, deprived Allardyce\xe2\x80\x99s team of the presence to punish a nervous Everton defence. Instead, in Lukaku, it was Everton who had a powerful centre-forward able to unsettle defenders and bring others into play.</p> <p>Lukaku\xe2\x80\x99s performance was a reminder of his importance to how Mart\xc3\xadnez wants his team to play as he tested Adri\xc3\xa1n in the West Ham goal from distance, drove at defenders all night and displayed the touch and creativity that have been lacking from his game too often this season. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has trained well all week with a specific target \xe2\x80\x93 to impose himself and his penetrating runs on the opposition,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mart\xc3\xadnez. \xe2\x80\x9cHis attitude was perfect.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Both sides threatened before the interval but Everton had the clearer openings through Lukaku and Steven Naismith, the pair just missing Adri\xc3\xa1n\xe2\x80\x99s left-hand post. They continued to trade shots after the restart, Kevin Mirallas lobbing over from Naismith\xe2\x80\x99s flick-on and Carl Jenkinson forcing Joel Robles to save at his near post. Downing went close with a right-foot drive that deflected out for a corner off the head of Sylvain Distin. It was returned with devastating effect. Morgan Amalfitano crossed to the near post and Collins, having lost Distin at the start of his run from the penalty spot, arrived in-between Naismith and Muhamed Besic to steer a bullet header beyond Robles.</p> <p>West Ham almost doubled their advantage from another corner seconds later. This time, from the left, the visitors worked the ball short to Mark Noble who floated an inviting cross on to the head of Enner Valencia. Robles thwarted the Ecuador striker at point-blank range. \xe2\x80\x9cHe should have scored and it would have been too much for Everton to come back from that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Allardyce, who will have Alex Song available for next Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s replay after the midfielder announced his retirement from international duty with Cameroon on Tuesday. Mart\xc3\xadnez concurred. \xe2\x80\x9cThat save could be a big turning point in our season,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>The Everton response was led, inevitably, by Lukaku. But with quality in short supply around him, his tireless efforts appeared to be in vain until stoppage time. The substitute Aiden McGeady released Bryan Oviedo down the left and the Costa Rican\xe2\x80\x99s cross fell to the man of the match who made no mistake at the back post, sparking a jubilant celebration from his manager on the touchline.</p>'
