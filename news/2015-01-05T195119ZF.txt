b'FA Cup fourth-round draw \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened!| Alan Smith'


b' <p>Is there a special atmosphere to expect if Chelsea would entertain Millwall?</p>  <p>asks Michael Schlagenhaufen via email. Yes, Michael, there would be a cracking atmosphere at Stamford Bridge but Millwall, as mentioned, will face a really difficult task at Bradford next week after their initial meeting at the Den ended 3-3 on Saturday.</p> <p>Paul Airey has a valid point about Cambridge United v Manchester United:</p>  <p>I know this plea will fall on deaf ears, but wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be refreshing if whoever reports on this fixture avoids the pitfall of writing about \xe2\x80\x9cUnited\xe2\x80\x9d if who they really mean is the team from Manchester rather than Cambridge?</p> <p>We live in hope!</p>  <p>And Elliot Carr-Barnsley adds \xe2\x80\xa6</p>  <p>Cambridge versus Man U? I smell a punditry call up for Dion Dublin.</p>  <p>Elsewhere, among several standard and uninspiring fixtures, if Liverpool win tonight Emile Heskey will be returning to Anfield in a Bolton shirt \xe2\x80\xa6</p> <p>On that note, I\xe2\x80\x99m off. Do pop over to AFC Wimbledon v Liverpool \xe2\x80\x93 live with Jacob Steinberg. Bye!</p>'
