b'<p>BACK AGAIN</p> <p>Guess who\xe2\x80\x99s back? After two weeks away, The Fiver is back! Or has it been three weeks away? It might be three weeks. Is it three weeks? Oh, who\xe2\x80\x99s keeping count anyway, all you really need to know is that the torture of non-stop eating and boozing is over and it\xe2\x80\x99s back to work with all your favourite people, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a shiny new gym membership that doubles up as your path to fitness and a useful way to bore your biggest enemy to death, and the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading tea-time email is back with a vengeance. New year, new Fiver. Just you watch. This year, the plan is to write at least seven jokes that raise a t1tter, to hit the deadline at least nine times and to up the readership from three people to at least four. But before we get started on that, first let\xe2\x80\x99s have a look back on what you might have missed while The Fiver was mainlining processed turkey slices and watching endless repeats of The Vicar of Dibley over Christmas.</p> <p>Quite a lot happened actually. Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with the managerial roundabout. After a surprisingly quiet spell of no one getting sacked for, hmmm, spending a load of cash on Dejan Lovren and Mario Balotelli, it spluttered into action when Crystal Palace\xe2\x80\x99s chairman, Smooth Steve Parish, decided that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t spend another minute listening to Neil Warnock ranting about referees or talking about the best type of tractor and sent him on his way. The day after Boxing Day, too! There\xe2\x80\x99s your Christmas spirit. But, really, there was no other choice left for Smooth Steve. Warnock was thoroughly out of his depth and soon it emerged that Smooth Steve wanted to bring in Palace legend Pardiola, who quite frankly had had it up to here with being given no thanks for doing a thoroughly meh job at the football club that used to be known as Newcastle United. The trauma of losing Pardew hit Mike Ashley hard but he cheered up once Palace handed him something in the region of \xc2\xa33m in compensation. Three million pounds for one Alan Pardew! And they say the economy is bust.</p> <p>Anyway Newcastle haven\xe2\x80\x99t managed to convince some new chump to come and be their head gopher yet, but supporters will be delighted to hear that John Carver has thrown his hat into the ring. Hopefully Carver bought that hat from Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s tat emporium and he has already boosted his chances by leading Newcastle Reserves to a memorable 1-0 defeat at Leicester City in the third round of the FA Cup. Meanwhile West Bromwich Albion politely asked Alan Irvine to do one last week and promptly brought in Tony Pulis. He\xe2\x80\x99s already given Baggies fans a taste of what they can expect by inspiring his new side to a thrilling 7-0 FA Cup win over mighty Gateshead. What a fun man! Give it a few days and he\xe2\x80\x99ll even make Saido Berahino smile.</p>     Drink it in. Photograph: Carl Recine/Action Images    <p>Other managers have been busy too. Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho reckons that there\xe2\x80\x99s a conspiracy against Chelsea. Here\xe2\x80\x99s what you need to know about that:</p> <p>The biggest story of the Christmas period was the announcement that $tevie Mbe will leave Liverpool once his contract runs out at the end of the season. Here\xe2\x80\x99s The Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s tribute:</p> <p>Anyway Mbe is probably going to end up in MLS, with LA Galaxy his most likely destination, and hopefully he\xe2\x80\x99ll inspire as much love over there as Frank Lampard, who has enraged long-suffering supporters of make-believe side NYCFC by deciding to extend his stay at Manchester City until the end of the season and possibly beyond. The Third Rail, an ancient independent NYCFC supporters group, have claimed \xe2\x80\x9coutrage\xe2\x80\x9d at Lampard\xe2\x80\x99s decision. Oh dear. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bit of a mess. This precisely is why Fiver FC turned Lampard down.</p> <p>Finally Barcelona haven\xe2\x80\x99t taken losing to The Moyesiah\xe2\x80\x99s Real Sociedad last night very well and have responded by sacking their director of football, Andoni Zubizarreta. Bloody cheek. Still, if Barcelona need any suggestions for who should replace him, then Joe Kinnear is on the market. And bam, that\xe2\x80\x99s one joke out of the way, six more to go.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Jacob Steinberg from 7.55pm GMT for MBM coverage of AFC Wimbledon 1-3 Liverpool in the FA Cup.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe are just playing with our hearts and make sure we die for the nation.
