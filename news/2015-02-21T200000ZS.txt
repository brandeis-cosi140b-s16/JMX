b'Stifling debate on offensive Old Firm chants only encourages bigots | Daniel Taylor'


b'<p>In America, it is known as the YSA problem. It has been a bugbear of Major League Soccer\xe2\x80\x99s commissioner, Don Garber, for longer than he will probably wish to remember and a couple of years ago, with a new television deal being negotiated, a memo went around that he could no longer tolerate that slightly strange tradition of supporters shouting: \xe2\x80\x9cYou suck asshole!\xe2\x80\x9d every time the opposition goalkeeper took a goal-kick.</p> <p>Real Salt Lake went for the naughty-step approach and warned their fans that if the song continued the club would not allow drums and banners inside the stadium, as well as halting privileges such as parking permits and discounted tickets. On the other hand, the New York Red Bulls opted for an incentive programme \xe2\x80\x93 bribery, to put it another way \xe2\x80\x93 and offered their supporters\xe2\x80\x99 groups $2,000 each if they could go four games YSA-free.</p> <p>Other clubs use different methods when it comes to the songs they dislike. Liverpool put a Bart Simpson cartoon on their website recently appealing for the naughty word in the Steven Gerrard song to be removed \xe2\x80\x93 roundly ignored, naturally \xe2\x80\x93 and the attempts at sanitising football crowds go all the way back to Brian Clough\xe2\x80\x99s early years at Nottingham Forest.</p>  <p> Related: Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger scarred for life by his war on Med with Monaco | Dominic Fifield  </p>   <p>Clough once ordered that a sign be carried around the City Ground before one game with the message: \xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, no swearing please! Brian.\xe2\x80\x9d When Clough was in the running for the England job the Trent End produced its own sign: \xe2\x80\x9cBrian, no leaving please! The gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s different, though, with Rangers, trying to navigate a way through the fog of bigotry that still pollutes the club and the realisation, even in February 2015, that anyone who has a go will quickly find the hate mob unleashed on them.</p> <p>Sure enough, the poison started flowing when Stan Collymore set up an online petition \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cSectarian chanting is illegal\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 aimed at turning down the volume on the Famine Song and Billy Boys and challenging some of the warped views that still exist behind Ibrox\xe2\x80\x99s red-bricked walls.</p> <p>In truth, the culture is so embedded and deep-rooted it might be 50 years, or longer, before Rangers (and Celtic) stop embarrassing modern Scotland.</p> <p>But at least he was willing to have a go, when he will have known that every wannabe Begbie on the internet would be on his case. Collymore was told very clearly his campaign wasn\xe2\x80\x99t welcome. There were threats of violence and other messages to his Twitter account that made it clear their first reaction was to attack, like zombies.</p> <p>One guy who turned out to be a member of the club\xe2\x80\x99s IT staff invited him to meet him in Glasgow, signed off with a clenched-fist emoticon that suggested he did not want to discuss Microsoft Windows or the latest edition of Smart Computing magazine. The Rangers Supporters\xe2\x80\x99 Trust, an organisation that presumably wants to be taken seriously, reminded its followers what happened to Ulrika Jonsson 17 years ago (a bit rich at a club where they idolise Paul Gascoigne) and released a statement describing Collymore as a \xe2\x80\x9cself-publicist\xe2\x80\x9d and an \xe2\x80\x9cinternet troll\xe2\x80\x9d, making petty jibes about his playing career and saying his complaints were \xe2\x80\x9cill-advised, inaccurate and inane\xe2\x80\x9d. Plus, of course, the default-setting option every time Rangers are put on the spot: what about Celtic? It\xe2\x80\x99s the tactic that is known in Glasgow as Whataboutery. Never mind what we did, what about them? OK, we\xe2\x80\x99re singing about the IRA or 19th-century famines \xe2\x80\x93 but what about the other lot?</p> <p>Maybe there are times when Collymore could be less strident and it would bring more people on board if he could soften his tone. His style will always put a few backs up and, in hindsight, maybe it would have been a more effective petition if it addressed both Old Firm clubs rather than just one.</p>  <p> Related: Worcester City\xe2\x80\x99s Shabir Khan sees red after body-slamming opponent </p>   <p>Yet it is still fairly abysmal that one of the sport\xe2\x80\x99s prominent broadcasters and racism campaigners tries to tackle a song that features the line \xe2\x80\x9cup to our knees in Fenian blood\xe2\x80\x9d and is dropped from his slot with BT Sport because the station \xe2\x80\x9cdid not agree with the nature of the debate\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>In Spain, they have been deliberating over the past week about whether Barcelona should be punished because a group of supporters known as Almog\xc3\xa0vers, latching on to some video footage of Cristiano Ronaldo on a birthday night out, started singing at one match: \xe2\x80\x9cEs un borracho, Cristiano es un borracho\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 translated to accuse him of being a drunk. The threat of disciplinary action may sound faintly preposterous bearing in mind what can regularly be heard at football grounds elsewhere but the death of a Deportivo la Coru\xc3\xb1a supporter during violence with Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid fans last November has led to a purge on any chants that Javier Tebas, president of Liga de F\xc3\xbatbol Profesional, says constitutes \xe2\x80\x9csymbolic violence\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Barcelona, therefore, have been charged and several other clubs are also in trouble. Sevilla are one of them because when they played M\xc3\xa1laga their fans were apparently singing: \xe2\x80\x9cWe want a tsunami in the Costa del Sol.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Lugo, in the Second Division, have been reported because fans sang \xe2\x80\x9cclown, clown\xe2\x80\x9d at Girona\xe2\x80\x99s Francisco Jos\xc3\xa9 Sandaza and it does make you wonder how long the backlog of disciplinary cases might be were the same rules to apply in the British leagues.</p> <p>Yet the songs Collymore highlighted are of an entirely different level. In 2006, Rangers were ordered by Uefa to make an announcement before each game clarifying that Billy\xe2\x80\x99s Boys was banned because of its sectarian content.</p> <p>The Famine Song contains the line \xe2\x80\x9cThe famine is over, why don\xe2\x80\x99t you go home?\xe2\x80\x9d and was deemed racist by three judges in 2008. Yet both were sung en masse, along with No Pope of Rome, at the Scottish League Cup semi-final against Celtic earlier this month. And, go on then, what about the other lot? Celtic\xe2\x80\x99s dunderheads went through songs referring to a \xe2\x80\x9cHun\xe2\x80\x9d and, of course, they have their own share of 90-minute and full-time bigots. But it was the Rangers end that seemed hell\xe2\x80\x91bent on going back through the decades and, if it does seem slightly unusual that Collymore is the one demanding change, maybe that is because we rarely hear a peep out of the people who really should be driving this.</p> <p>The Scottish Professional Football League hides behind a rule that means clubs cannot be disciplined if they have taken steps \xe2\x80\x9cso far as is reasonably practicable\xe2\x80\x9d and the Scottish FA is just as feeble.</p> <p>As for BT Sport, would it not have been better to highlight Collymore\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate complaints and have a grown-up debate rather than decide it was too toxic and take him off air. \xe2\x80\x9cWe abhor all forms of racism,\xe2\x80\x9d read a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cIt should not be tolerated in sport. When issues of racism or sectarianism emerge, they should be tackled and discussed in the correct manner.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Except it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to put out a press release and promise the discussion will take place on another day. Why not involve the man who has brought it to light? And do they really not understand the irony that Gazza, the guy who once played a mock flute during an Old Firm game, is their guest on Sunday?</p> <p>The same statement argues that it is \xe2\x80\x9cnot censorship\xe2\x80\x9d that Collymore was removed from his role. Maybe not, but what has actually happened is that Collymore has complained a bit too vociferously for the station\xe2\x80\x99s liking and the relevant people have taken what looks suspiciously like a commercially motivated decision rather than one that is actually fuelled by what is right and wrong.</p> <p>Collymore had promised taking his petition to the various sponsors and broadcasters and suggesting they boycott Rangers until the sectarian songs stopped. Would the relevant people have had the nerve? Well, just look at what has happened instead. On Friday, when Rangers played at Raith Rovers, the soundtrack was defiantly predictable. The television executives have run a mile, Collymore has been bumped and the Rangers Supporters\xe2\x80\x99 Trust has told its followers they \xe2\x80\x9ccan chalk that up as a minor victory\xe2\x80\x9d. And everyone wonders why we are stuck in the same old loop.</p> Fans can make it Jam yesterday, not tomorrow   <p> Related: Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho spot-on with response to Chelsea fans\xe2\x80\x99 Paris incident | Paul Wilson </p>   <p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope Souleymane S does accept Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to be a guest for a future home game and sees for himself what the vast majority of supporters make of the squalid events that have engulfed the club over the past week.</p> <p>Something tells me he would be overwhelmed by the reaction if he were invited on to the pitch and there is also no doubt the television images could be infinitely more useful for Chelsea than any message in the club programme or statement on their website.</p> <p>It was 1978 when the Jam released Down in the Tube Station at Midnight \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cthey smelt of pubs and Wormwood Scrubs and too many right-wing meetings\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 and no doubt many people watching the video footage from Richelieu-Drouot station felt it belonged to that era. The truth is that this small element has never left Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s support and Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho is wrong when he says they don\xe2\x80\x99t belong to the club. They do and they will have the stamps in their passports to prove it.</p> <p>Souleymane\xe2\x80\x99s presence might not drive them away but the crowd\xe2\x80\x99s response might send out the loudest message yet about what everyone else at Stamford Bridge feels about it \xe2\x80\x93 and that, at least, would be a start.</p>'
