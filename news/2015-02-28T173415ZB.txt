b'Burnley 0-1 Swansea City | Premier League match report'


b'<p>As one survival bid was completed before the start of March, another was rendered more improbable. Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s grasp on their Premier League status is weakening. A side that competes admirably conceded farcically as Swansea secured victory at Turf Moor with a goal that involved Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s past, in Jack Cork, and their present, as Kieran Trippier inadvertently applied the decisive touch. Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s past six games have yielded two points and a chance to escape the relegation zone was spurned. With Liverpool and Manchester City their next two opponents, they face the prospect of an extended stay in the bottom three.</p> <p>In contrast, Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s destiny is decided. A fifth successive season in the top flight was rarely in doubt. Now it is a certainty. \xe2\x80\x9cForty points is the first point of call for anyone outside the bigger clubs,\xe2\x80\x9d said their manager, Garry Monk. \xe2\x80\x9cWe wanted to get there as soon as we could. We have got there now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It was an achievement he could savour, along with his side\xe2\x80\x99s resilience. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had to do the basics,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, taking pride in pragmatism. As a result, history repeated itself. In August, Swansea followed a 2-1 victory against Manchester United with a 1-0 win over Burnley. So, too, in February.</p> <p>Their latest clean sheet owed much to their goalkeeper, Lukasz Fabianski. The Pole\xe2\x80\x99s second-half saves from Michael Kightly, Ashley Barnes and the substitute Sam Vokes all showed his conviction. His finest stop came after a quarter of the game, when a spinning Danny Ings occupied three defenders, Barnes was left unmarked six yards from goal and Fabianski blocked the striker\xe2\x80\x99s shot with his chest. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was a big chance,\xe2\x80\x9d said the rueful Burnley manager, Sean Dyche.</p> <p>Barnes\xe2\x80\x99s inability to take it ensured a return to obscurity after a week of notoriety. Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho had branded his challenge on Nemanja Matic \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal\xe2\x80\x9d but, after being vilified by the Chelsea manager, he was celebrated by the Burnley public and the recipient of the loudest pre-match ovation. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a respect element from fans to players here,\xe2\x80\x9d Dyche said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey know they have a group giving everything.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As ever, Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s effort could not be faulted, but they lacked incision and invention. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a bit of flatness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dyche, who wondered if the furore surrounding Barnes affected his team, but his side\xe2\x80\x99s performance supported the long-held suspicions they do not possess the quality required to prosper. While Mourinho felt penalty decisions went Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s way seven days earlier, they did not here when Neil Taylor tugged Vokes. \xe2\x80\x9cHe gets dragged around his waist. I have seen them given,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dyche, who praised his striker for an understated reaction. \xe2\x80\x9cWe value our honesty.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Swansea valued their industry. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had to scrap it out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Monk. Fittingly, then, the decisive goal came in scrappy style. \xe2\x80\x9cIt felt it was going to pan out as an indifferent 0-0,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dyche. Instead, Baf\xc3\xa9timbi Gomis flicked on Jonjo Shelvey\xe2\x80\x99s corner for Cork and when his shot was brilliantly touched on to the bar by Tom Heaton the midfielder miscued his attempt to convert the rebound. The grounded Heaton saved again, only to see the ball bounce in off Trippier\xe2\x80\x99s thigh.</p> <p>It was an indication of Shelvey\xe2\x80\x99s influence. His playmaking skills were apparent as he released first Wayne Routledge and then Gomis with raking passes. The Englishman lobbed wide of an unguarded net and the French striker blazed way over the bar. Despite playing a part in the goal, Gomis gave a decidedly mixed display and his replacement, N\xc3\xa9lson Oliveira, almost scored a second goal from an acute angle.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think there were too many chances for either side,\xe2\x80\x9d Monk said. But now Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s chances of staying up are altogether smaller.</p>'
