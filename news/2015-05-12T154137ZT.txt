b'<p>\xe2\x80\x98BLADES STUNNER\xe2\x80\x99 GETS A DUSTING OFF</p> <p>The play-offs, eh? Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s as if the entire eight-month trudge of actual league football is but a bizarrely bloated amuse-bouche for the post-season feasting to come. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a supposedly humorous tea-timely email in which the actually interesting bit \xe2\x80\x93 in the unlikely event of there actually being one \xe2\x80\x93 is preceded by a bizarre and only occasionally relevant, rambling introductory paragraph, which might start brightly in a spirit of blind optimism \xe2\x80\x93 much as most teams commence their own league campaigns \xe2\x80\x93 only to get bogged down in a senseless, spirit-sapping avalanche of words and clearly unnecessary and totally irrelevant perambulations involving, perhaps, the Sette Colli di Roma or the bespectacled Greek singer Nana Mouskouri or the blatant holes in the plotting that for many ruin Agatha Christie\xe2\x80\x99s Death on the Nile, leading to a great number of readers at some point developing an all-consuming feeling of hopelessness that may or may not result in them throwing their imaginary Fiver season tickets at the notional Fiver bench and stomping prematurely from the screen, even though the action they came here to find \xe2\x80\x93 inasmuch as there will be any action whatsoever \xe2\x80\x93 might be about to happen any moment now. But, we digress.</p> <p>Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s all in the name. Swine. Dun. Swindon. A town whose name amounts to little more than a simple description of its original purpose, as a dun \xe2\x80\x93 or hill, as non-Saxons might have it \xe2\x80\x93 full of swine. Glad. Win. Gladwin. A player whose name amounts to little more than a simple football sentence after all verbs, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, articles and indeed spaces have been removed. A man who would fit in perfectly playing in the hole behind Delightedscored, in front of a defence marshalled by Overmooncleansheet and Guttedlateequaliser. And a player whose late-season goal-spurt is propelling the Robins out of League One.</p> <p>Just a month ago Ben Gladwin could look back at a Swindon career of 28 starts and 13 substitute appearances over two seasons to which he had contributed just three goals. In six games since he has scored eight. Six remarkable games in which his side have ended matches having collectively bagged one, one, two, three, four and now five goals.</p> <p>Two games ago, after Jacob Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s 43rd-second strike put Colchester United ahead against Swindon in the final game of the standard season, Gladwin promised his side would henceforth \xe2\x80\x9cstart games a lot sharper\xe2\x80\x9d. He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t kidding: last night he scored after four and 10 minutes of an absolute humdinger against Sheffield (a field by the river Sheaf, since you ask) United. It was a game in which the action zipped from one end to the other in a madcap manner and that ended with the improbable scoreline of 5-5 \xe2\x80\x93 five-a-side-football in more ways than one.</p> <p>Having led 3-0, 4-2 and finally 5-3 with two minutes of normal time to play, Swindon snatched a draw from the clutches of victory, and only after clinging on through nine uncomfortable minutes of stoppage time. Happily, with a 3-3 and a 1-1 also in their last four games \xe2\x80\x93 they also earned themselves a final chance to prove that they\xe2\x80\x99re more than a 22-legged pools bonanza with a 7-6 aggregate win and a place in the play-off final. Their opponents at Wembley, Preston, will be praying that Gladwin\xe2\x80\x99s nominative-determinism days are behind him. But then they should be good at that, what with originally being a town full of priests.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Simon Burnton from 7.45pm BST for MBM coverage of Bayern Munich 1-4 Barcelona (1-7 on agg).</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a world where lots of people talk \xe2\x80\xa6 and sometimes they speak too much. \xe2\x80\x9c[He] spoke but he has never come to see a training session, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know our atmosphere, he speaks from the outside \xe2\x80\xa6 He could have kept quiet; that would have been better\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Carlo Ancelotti as good as takes his belt and threatens to wrap Gareth Bale\xe2\x80\x99s Mr 15% across the laughing gear should he keep on speaking publicly about the Welshman\xe2\x80\x99s supposed on-field problems.</p>     That eyebrow\xe2\x80\x99s gone rogue.

The company\xe2\x80\x99s full name is Huskisson Bobcat, based in Liverpool. I once visited their premises for a job in the early 80s and asked where the \xe2\x80\x98Huskisson\xe2\x80\x99 bit came from. \xe2\x80\x98He was the first person killed on the railway \xe2\x80\x93 run over by Stephenson\xe2\x80\x99s Rocket,\xe2\x80\x99 I was told. \xe2\x80\x98Unlucky for him. Still, at least he\xe2\x80\x99s famous,\xe2\x80\x99 I joked. \xe2\x80\x98He was my great grandfather,\xe2\x80\x99 came the reply. I left\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Leo Roberts.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s not too early to be doling out prizes, can I offer a nomination for football\xe2\x80\x99s least mercenary, bullish, crass or grasping event of the year? It must go to Ajax players\xe2\x80\x99 mothers accompanying their sons out on to the pitch for Mothers\xe2\x80\x99 Day. A moment of pure, life-affirming love and pride.

Hence why he\xe2\x80\x99s doing one to Mainz.</p> <p>Two days after his Chesterfield side was knocked out of the League One play-offs, manager Paul Cook has hot-footed down \xe2\x80\x93 both the country and the divisions \xe2\x80\x93 to take over at Portsmouth. \xe2\x80\x9cBeing able to manage a massive club like this is something I\xe2\x80\x99m very excited about,\xe2\x80\x9d he cheered.</p> <p>Meanwhile in Honduras, Marlon Pe\xc3\xb1a, the Real Espa\xc3\xb1a right-back, decided that the best way to deal with an unruly pitch invader was to fly-kick him in the temple.</p> <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s nothing but F.U.N at Brisbane Road right now, where Leyton Orient are still making their players train despite being relegated to League Two nine days ago. \xe2\x80\x9cReally looking forward to double training sessions this week,\xe2\x80\x9d sniped defender Mathieu Baudry, turning the sarcasm up to 11.</p> <p>Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal is ready to consider offers for Robin van Persie. Bidding is understood to currently stand at two boxes of country chicken Wheat Crunchies and a thumbed copy of No Cigar magazine.</p> <p>Finally, the football writers of the land got together and decided two things. One: Sufjan Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 latest album is not his best. Picky lot, those football writers. And two: Eden Hazard is their player of the year.</p> STILL WANT MORE? <p>David Squires gets his teeth stuck into the fight to avoid Big Vase.</p>     Deeply awful decisions. Illustration: David Squires for the Guardian    <p>Goals! Goals! Goals! If you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a good time.</p> <p>Nick Ames prefers to watch re-runs of Ipswich\xe2\x80\x99s 1972\xe2\x80\x9373 Texaco Cup victory but he stopped long enough to write about the top-scoring Premier League defenders and where they are now.</p> <p>Scott Murray looks at the correlation between a well-designed kit and well-functioning team.</p> <p>Big in Japan.
