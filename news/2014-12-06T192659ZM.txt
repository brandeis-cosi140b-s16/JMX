b'<p>Eto\xe2\x80\x99o breaks into the area down the right and wins a corner off Demichelis. But his corner is easily cleared, and that\xe2\x80\x99s that! City hold on! They can count their lucky stars - they could easily have been down to nine men in the first half, while the decisive penalty was soft to say the least - but then they did lose star man Sergio Aguero within two minutes of kick off. So swings and roundabouts, I guess, even though Everton might not see it that way. City move to within three points of Chelsea at the top of the table. What looked an insurmountable eight-point gap now looks very workable. The 2014-15 Premier League title race: it\xe2\x80\x99s on!</p>     Martin Demichelis celebrates with Joe Hart.
