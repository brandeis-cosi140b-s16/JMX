b'Saturday Sundae: Smackdown! Worcester win by two goals and a submission'


b'HERO OF THE DAY <p>Picture the scene. Augsburg are 2-1 down with seconds left. Up goes the keeper, Marwin Hitz, the ball comes into the box, he leaps and Roy-of-the-Rovers it into the back of the net. The greatest Hitz.</p> Villains of the day <p>\xe2\x96\xa0 Ashley Barnes can count himself lucky that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t end Nemanja Matic\xe2\x80\x99s season with a tackle that was far too high, far too late and far too unpunished.</p> <p>\xe2\x96\xa0 And Worcester City\xe2\x80\x99s Shabir Khan \xe2\x80\x93 setting the internet alight after footage emerged of him carrying out a full body-slam on Stockport County\xe2\x80\x99s Charlie Russell in a feisty Conference North encounter. After a proper old\xe2\x80\x91fashioned melee, the former Pakistan international was sent off.</p> Celebration of the day <p>Having failed a medical at Hull last summer, QPR\xe2\x80\x99s Charlie Austin mocked the doc by hobbling in front of the fans when he scored.</p> Banner of the day <p>Crystal Palace fans in the Holmesdale stand dabbled in Premier League politics: sticking it to the man during the Arsenal match. \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa35bn in the trough, yet supporters still exploited. Share the wealth, pigs.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> RELIEF OF THE DAY <p>Joey Barton finally put an end to his run of seven consecutive yellow cards by landing a red for punching Hull\xe2\x80\x99s Tom Huddlestone right where it hurts, with the referee standing two yards away. He tweeted later: \xe2\x80\x9cMy actions weren\xe2\x80\x99t malicious \xe2\x80\xa6 but I can appreciate it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t right.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
