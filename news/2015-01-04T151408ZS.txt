b'Sunderland 1-0 Leeds United | FA Cup third round match report'


b'<p>Shortly before kick-off several members of Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s 1973 FA Cup-winning team were presented to the crowd. The only shame was that Dennis Tueart, Jimmy Montgomery, Micky Horswill and friends could not remain on the pitch on a day when Gus Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s class of 2014-15 rather huffed and puffed into the fourth round.</p> <p>It was the first time Sunderland had been drawn against Leeds United in the competition since that momentous May afternoon at Wembley almost 42 years ago. This time Leeds were very much the underdogs and, despite protests to the contrary, the suspicion lingered that the Cup was neither side\xe2\x80\x99s priority.</p> <p>While Neil Redfearn made seven changes to his Leeds line-up, Poyet fielded a reasonably strong team. He had agonised over whether to start Patrick van Aanholt after the left-back\xe2\x80\x99s lengthy lay-off following shoulder surgery but his gamble was fully vindicated. Not only did Van Aanholt score a fine goal but he was arguably the best player on view.</p> <p>With the former Chelsea full-back supplying much-needed pace and width, Sunderland began well but allowed their first-half superiority to evaporate. Leeds were vastly improved in the second period and the Premier League side were relieved to avoid a replay \xe2\x80\x93 or worse \xe2\x80\x93 after Rodolph Austin and Luke Murphy took charge of midfield.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe were totally in control in the first half and should have put the game to bed but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t. We\xe2\x80\x99re a bit disappointed with our finishing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Poyet, once an assistant manager to Dennis Wise at Leeds. \xe2\x80\x9cStarting Patrick was a massive decision. He played without having trained with the first team and I\xe2\x80\x99d have been killed if something had happened to him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Welcome as Van Aanholt\xe2\x80\x99s return turned out, a section of Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s support has been willing Poyet to play Emanuele Giaccherini and Ricardo \xc3\x81lvarez, arguably his two most creative individuals, in the same starting XI and they finally got their wish.</p> <p>It did not take long for the pair to combine in discomfiting Leeds. First Giaccherini turned Gaetano Berardi, leaving the defender on his backside, before forcing Marco Silvestri into a fine save. From the resultant corner \xc3\x81lvarez saw a left-foot shot deflected on to the bar.</p> <p>This initial, somewhat deceptive, home dominance was eventually made to count when Van Aanholt met Steven Fletcher\xe2\x80\x99s pass before beating Silvestri courtesy of a crisp, angled shot into the bottom corner from the edge of the area. Poyet replaced \xc3\x81lvarez \xe2\x80\x93 decent on the ball but worryingly ineffective off it \xe2\x80\x93 with Connor Wickham at half-time. Wickham had barely had a touch when Costel Pantilimon was required to save smartly from Adryan and then Brian Montenegro.</p> <p>Clearly galvanised by Redfearn\xe2\x80\x99s half-time homily, Leeds were transformed. A foul on Charlie Taylor by Sebastian Larsson prompted vociferous penalty appeals but the offence occurred fractionally outside the box and Austin fluffed the free-kick. \xe2\x80\x9cIt looked a penalty to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said a rueful Redfearn. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd if we\xe2\x80\x99d made it 1-1, I think we\xe2\x80\x99d have gone on and won.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>With Sunderland fading, chances came and went at both ends as the match turned surprisingly open.</p> <p>When Liam Cooper connected with Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s cross a replay beckoned but the defender\xe2\x80\x99s header struck a post with Pantilimon beaten. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were the better side by a fair stretch in the second half,\xe2\x80\x9d said Redfearn. \xe2\x80\x9cWe turned it into a cup tie.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Man of the match Patrick van Aanholt (Sunderland)</p>'
