b'Real Madrid v Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid: Copa del Rey \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s that. Well, Real paid the heaviest of prices for a sloppy start in both halves. That will really anger Carlo Ancelotti. The possession his team had \xe2\x80\x93 and the chances \xe2\x80\x93 didn\xe2\x80\x99t really matter after each goal was scored. It felt like they\xe2\x80\x99d given themselves a needless extra hurdle to leap before they could get going again. As for Fernando Torres, it was nice to see him smiling like that again. He had very little of the ball apart from his two goals but the confidence he showed for both finishes has been in absence for the best part of the past four years. Maybe this really will be his Second Coming. Enjoy feeling the love Fernando. Thanks for your emails. Goodnight. </p>         '
