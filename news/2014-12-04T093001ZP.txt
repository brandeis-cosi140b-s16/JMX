b'Premier League: 10 talking points from the midweek action | Guardian writers'


b'1) Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s mental block against Chelsea a familiar story <p>That was a great story from Roy Keane recently, in one of his less embittered moments about Sir Alex Ferguson, when he recalled a game at Manchester United that had shown him that sometimes a manager does not need to go into too much detail in his team-talk.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was Tottenham at home,\xe2\x80\x9d Keane recounted. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought: \xe2\x80\x98Please don\xe2\x80\x99t go on about Tottenham, we all know what Tottenham is about, they are nice and tidy but we\xe2\x80\x99ll fucking do them.\xe2\x80\x99 He came in and said: \xe2\x80\x98Lads, it\xe2\x80\x99s only Tottenham.\xe2\x80\x99 And that was it. Brilliant!\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Only Tottenham? It is certainly tempting to wonder if Chelsea have started to feel the same way about this supposed rivalry. It is 28 matches since Spurs last won at Stamford Bridge in February 1990 (six of their starting XI were not even born) and, home and away, their record is now five wins out of the last 58 encounters.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cTo be fair, many of our players don\xe2\x80\x99t know that,\xe2\x80\x9d Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho countered. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe many of the Spurs players know that either. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t play a part. Every game is a separate event. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what happened five, 10 or 20 years ago. Obviously, though, it\xe2\x80\x99s a long time, a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Long enough to wonder if there is now a mental block for Spurs when it comes to these fixtures. The players changes, the managers change, but always they seem to have the same shortcomings. It is known as being a soft touch and their latest defeat at Stamford Bridge showed, again, this is a team that needs to re-invent themselves. Daniel Taylor</p> 2) Forster\xe2\x80\x99s consistency means he deserves England chance     Fraser Forster makes a flying stop to deny Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Aaron Ramsey in another impressive performance for Southampton. Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA    <p>Fraser Forster had another excellent game at the Emirates. He continues to look an athletic and imposing goalkeeper. At the same time his consistency raises an interesting question. How many excellent games does it take before perceptions begin to shift and it becomes more widely accepted that Forster, for all his lack of caps and shampoo-flogging glitz is simply an excellent goalkeeper, on balance perhaps the best England have right now? There were at least two excellent saves in Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s 1-0 defeat, the best the arching, clawing, rather cinematic effort to keep out Olivier Giroud\xe2\x80\x99s late header. Beyond this Forster did all the basics well, as he tends to, kicking and catching with assurance. He is an old fashioned kind of presence, an echo of the Nigel Martyn-ish style goalkeeper: unassumingly complete, quietly physical. Not charismatically wiry like David de Gea, currently the most compelling goalkeeper in the league, nor as eye-catching as Joe Hart. But while Hart often seems to have a mistake lurking in him Forster just looks solid. If you were starting from scratch, all pecking orders forgotten, he would have a good chance of being England\xe2\x80\x99s goalkeeper on merit. Goalies usually rely on their rivals making a mistake to get a chance in the first team. Forster deserves one simply for his own fine form. Barney Ronay</p> 3) Steven Gerrard: Quarterback or No10? <p>Last season Steven Gerrard morphed into a quarterback and was picking the ball up off the back four. On Tuesday at Leicester the Liverpool captain was deployed in between the two wide receivers and causing problems at the top end of the pitch \xe2\x80\x93 quite a shift but one that Brendan Rodgers suggested has the potential to work well going forward for player and club.</p> <p>The Liverpool manager explained the lack of pace up front this season, as a result of Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez\xe2\x80\x99s departure to Barcelona and Daniel Sturridge\xe2\x80\x99s injury problems, meant that Gerrard was better suited to a more advanced role, as opposed to sitting deep and playing those long, raking passes that encouraged speed merchants to stretch their legs. </p>   <div data-embed-type="table" class="player-card player-card--football" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <div class="player-card__image-container">  </div> <div class="player-card__player"> <div class="player-card__position" itemprop="jobTitle">Midfielder</div> <div class="player-card__name" itemprop="name">Steven Gerrard</div> </div> <dl class="player-card__stats"> <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Appearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">14</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Goals</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">3</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">17</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots on target</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">18%</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Offsides</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">0</dd> </dl> </div>   <p>Rodgers said: \xe2\x80\x9cHow I set the team up last year, Steven was a playmaker, he played behind the midfield, the reason for that was we had three super quick players up front, in Sturridge, who could spin off the shoulder, Su\xc3\xa1rez, who wanted to run in behind, and obviously Sterling. We looked at that again this year, looking at how we are set up and we don\xe2\x80\x99t have that similar type of game, so we had to change the structure. For me, Steven can still have a great influence but maybe I can pick him in a different role.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Rodgers went on to talk about how he would be \xe2\x80\x9cmapping out the rest of the season\xe2\x80\x9d for Gerrard and \xe2\x80\x9clooking at the games to play\xe2\x80\x9d, all of which points to the 34-year-old being rested again on Saturday, when Sunderland visit Anfield. After all, Liverpool host Basel in the Champions League the following Tuesday, in a game they must win to reach the knockout stage, and visit Old Trafford five days later. The following Wednesday they have a tricky Capital One Cup quarter-final at Bournemouth to negotiate. Three games in little more than a week that could make or break Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s season. Gerrard will not want to miss any of them. \xe2\x80\x9cI know that if I can manage him, he can still have a real impact for this team,\xe2\x80\x9d Rodgers said. Stuart James </p> 4) Pardew runs the risk of over-caution <p> \xe2\x80\x9cYou should always take risks in the Premier League,\xe2\x80\x9d Alan Pardew claimed after the 1-1 draw at Burnley, explaining why he had introduced R\xc3\xa9my Cabella at half time to bring some technical ability to bear on an otherwise lifeless performance. The substitution paid off, within a couple of minutes the Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s blocked shot led directly to Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s equaliser, leading Tyneside fans to wonder why Pardew decided not to start with the player. It was the same against West Ham at the weekend, when Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s winning run came to an end and Pardew was accused of timidity in his team selection. At least West Ham are riding fairly high in the table, however. Many Newcastle fans could not work out why Pardew opted for a defensive selection against bottom three Burnley \xe2\x80\x93 at least they were at the start of play \xe2\x80\x93 and then moaned that nothing was being created. \xe2\x80\x9cThe first half was hard to watch,\xe2\x80\x9d the manager admitted. \xe2\x80\x9cI was quite pleased to see the fans stayed for the second half.\xe2\x80\x9d Paul Wilson</p> 5) Swansea make a mockery of Redknapp\xe2\x80\x99s defence <p>In pleading his case at QPR Harry Redknapp continues to stress how difficult it is for promoted teams to survive in the Premier League, but the Liberty Stadium provided an unfortunate context. Swansea, promoted in 2011, have finished comfortably in mid-table for the last three seasons and their 2-0 victory over Redknapp\xe2\x80\x99s charges lifted them to sixth. Moreover they are not just surviving, they are playing some of the best football to be found anywhere in the league \xe2\x80\x93 and at a fraction of QPR\xe2\x80\x99s investment. Southampton are another obvious example of teams who came up and more than held their own, ditto Stoke and West Ham. Old Harry\xe2\x80\x99s excuse is a poor one this time. Joe Lovejoy </p> 6) What happens if West Brom keep losing?      Pos Team P GD Pts      16 West Brom 14 -6 13    17 Hull 14 -6 12    18 Burnley 14 -12 12    19 QPR 14 -13 11    20 Leicester 14 -10 10       <p>West Bromwich Albion have become renowned for making ruthless managerial changes when they feel momentum is building against them but there must be a law of diminishing returns inherent within this tactic.</p> <p>Roberto Di Matteo was in his second season at The Hawthorns when Jeremy Peace and Dan Ashworth, the chairman and the then-technical and sporting director, sensed that the Premier League status recently earned was in jeopardy. After an autumn in which West Brom had won at Arsenal and drawn at Manchester United, a winter of six straight defeats left Di Matteo out in the cold. Identifying Roy Hodgson, deemed as damaged goods after his stint at Liverpool, as the man to steady the ship proved a masterstroke.</p> <p>One England appointment later, with mid-table security seemingly assured, Steve Clarke looked another steady appointment as head coach. Perhaps Peace, with Ashworth having followed Hodgson into the FA\xe2\x80\x99s embrace, thought he could repeat the magic of two years earlier when he decided he could dispense with Clarke this time 12 months ago. But Pepe Mel proved to be no Hodgson; and when Albion recognised they had made a mistake, a club who have prided themselves on stability were onto their fifth head coach in as many years.</p> <p>Irvine is known throughout the game as an excellent coach and a good guy. But perhaps what Albion are crying out for now is a manager with authority. Perhaps Irvine can be that man; admitting he will do his best to coach players he does not necessarily sign reflects problems within this \xe2\x80\x9ccontinental structure\xe2\x80\x9d. Facing games against Hull City, Aston Villa \xe2\x80\x93 gulp \xe2\x80\x93 and Queens Park Rangers could leave Peace with nowhere to turn should they fail to end this losing sequence. The addition of Terry Burton as a footballing technical director last summer should add a calming influence.</p> <p>But then how long does the next guy get? Three months? What once looked like ruthless efficiency is starting to resemble a random hire-and-fire approach. West Brom fans should be hoping Irvine can turn this momentum around and earn himself \xe2\x80\x93 and the club \xe2\x80\x93 time. Peter Lansley</p> 7) Wilson vindicates Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s trust in youth     James Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s performance for Manchester United against Stoke would suggest he will get plenty more chances this season. Photograph: Matthew Ashton/AMA/Corbis    <p>The sight of James Wilson bursting through the Stoke City defence in the second half of Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 win on Tuesday evening may convince a few more fans the decision to allow Danny Welbeck to leave for Arsenal was correct. Just 19 on Monday, Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s jet-heeled pace impressed but so too did the quick feet he again showed to create the space to run into, having previously done so earlier in the contest when bedazzling the visiting defence in their area.</p> <p>Without Welbeck\xe2\x80\x99s departure Wilson may still be consigned to the Under-21s. Instead he now directly competes with Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Radamel Falcao for a place in the XI. Of this challenge Wilson says: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s great to be in contention with such names in the world of football as theirs. Obviously with the competition in training and even in the games as well, if I can just get a few minutes here and there, then hopefully I can get my chance further down the line.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>At Old Trafford on Tuesday Wilson was given more than a brief cameo. The Biddulph-born boy was handed the nod ahead of the bona fide superstar, Falcao, who was a reserve.</p> <p>Here Louis van Gaal maintained his promise to give youth a chance. Wilson failed to score but sparkled enough to take the opportunity. There should be many more this season. Jamie Jackson</p> 8) First sign of Europa excuses for Everton <p>Goodison Park heard not only boos for Everton\xe2\x80\x99s laboured display against Hull City on Wednesday but the first sound of a Europa League excuse from Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez. Having claimed European football has not exacted a toll on his squad this season \xe2\x80\x93 prior to hamstring injuries to the influential pair of Steven Naismith and James McCarthy admittedly \xe2\x80\x93 the Everton manager cited the extra workload as a factor in his side\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective response to Sone Aluko\xe2\x80\x99s merited equaliser for Steve Bruce\xe2\x80\x99s side. \xe2\x80\x9cHull stopped and started the game a lot and the referee did well to add six minutes of stoppage time but they were no good to us because we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the energy,\xe2\x80\x9d he lamented. The worry for Mart\xc3\xadnez is that Everton\xe2\x80\x99s poor results at home, and inability to break down opponents, are not a recent trend. Nor does tiredness carry much weight as a reason for Ross Barkley\xe2\x80\x99s current difficulties. The Everton midfielder has featured in only nine domestic matches this season due to injury, Sylvain Distin in 12, but the pair epitomised the lack of invention and defensive frailty that enabled Hull to depart Goodison with a point. Andy Hunter</p> 9) With Zabaleta around City will always be in with a shout <p>Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero and his goals are bound to have a very big say in the destination of this year\xe2\x80\x99s Premier League title and so, too, will Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s habit of dominating midfields but no one should underestimate Pablo Zabaleta\xe2\x80\x99s importance to Manchester City.</p>   <div data-embed-type="table" class="player-card player-card--football" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <div class="player-card__image-container">  </div> <div class="player-card__player"> <div class="player-card__position" itemprop="jobTitle">Defender</div> <div class="player-card__name" itemprop="name">Pablo Zabaleta</div> </div> <dl class="player-card__stats"> <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Appearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">10</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Goals</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">1</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">7</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots on target</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">14%</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Offsides</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">0</dd> </dl> </div>   <p>When Sunderland began brightly on Wednesday night the right-back \xe2\x80\x93 keeping Bacary Sagna on the bench \xe2\x80\x93 proved Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s best defender. Later Zabaleta completed a one-two with Samir Nasri before directing an impudent lob over Costel Pantilimon and into the far corner. It was a goal most striker\xe2\x80\x99s would cherish. City fans may harbour mixed views about Mark Hughes but few \xc2\xa36.5millions can have been better spent than that the Welshman invested in bringing Zabaleta to Manchester from Espanyol in 2008. Few right-backs can have enjoyed so much trust from assorted team-mates and successive managers. In many ways Zabaleta has become City\xe2\x80\x99s heart and soul. Louise Taylor </p> 10) Villa need Benteke firing     Aston Villa\xe2\x80\x99s Christian Benteke celebrates his goal against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Tuesday Photograph: Neville Williams/Aston Villa FC via Getty Images    <p>Aston Villa were fortunate to beat Crystal Palace on Tuesday night. In truth, they were extremely limited going forward with only Christian Benteke as a genuine threat. The Belgian scored his first goal since March \xe2\x80\x93 a fine run from wide and finish after dispossessing Scott Dann \xe2\x80\x93 and now hopes to return to the kind of form that made him one of the league\xe2\x80\x99s top strikers not so long ago. Injury has curtailed his progress since then but how Villa need him to stay fit. Paul Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s side have only scored eight goals this season. James Riach</p>'
