b'Football transfer rumours: Joe Allen to Manchester United?'


b'<p>We\xe2\x80\x99ll start the day with some high-grade banter: \xc3\x81ngel Di Mar\xc3\xada has handed in a transfer request after Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s Capital One Cup fiasco against MK Dons. Ho ho ho, tee hee hee.</p> <p>And here\xe2\x80\x99s some more banter for you \xe2\x80\x93 United were actually clever to make an early exit from the cup, as it will allow them to concentrate on their relegation battle. Kaboom! It\xe2\x80\x99s always good to let off some steam in the morning.</p> <p>All in all, it\xe2\x80\x99s not looking great for United. At this rate, Louis van Gaal is going to start his next press conference by saying he has something to tell the world, before peeling off a mask to reveal he\xe2\x80\x99s actually been David Moyes all along. At this point, nothing would be a surprise \xe2\x80\x93 not even news that United are plotting a \xc2\xa320m move for Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Joe Allen in a hasty bid to shore up their midfield. Good luck with that one, lads.</p> <p>Arsenal are also giving off a whiff of desperation now that it has been confirmed that Olivier Giroud has foot knack. Weirdly, now the worst has come to the worst, Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger seems less than keen to rely on Yaya Sanogo for the next few months and is thus plotting a move for the striker he should have signed a year ago. But who could it be? The usual names are in the mix. PSG\xe2\x80\x99s Edinson Cavani is available for a cool \xc2\xa350m. Torino\xe2\x80\x99s Alessio Cerci has been mooted. United will happily sell Danny Welbeck for \xc2\xa316m. Nikola Zigic is a target.</p> <p>Yes, that Nikola Zigic. The lumbering, goal-shy Birmingham City hotshot will soon be leading the Arsenal attack, according to the Serbian media. Clearly Wenger believes that if he can turn Thierry Henry from a callow winger into the greatest striker in the world, he can have a similar transformative effect on Zigic\xe2\x80\x99s game, turning him from a big man with a surprisingly bad touch into a big man with a surprisingly bad touch who plays up front for Arsenal. That Wenger \xe2\x80\x93 what a maverick.</p> <p>One player Arsenal look unlikely to sign is Radamel Falcao, though. Why? Well, who needs Falcao when you have Zigic? But more pertinently, Real Madrid, flush with the Di Mar\xc3\xada cash, are going to sign the Monaco striker instead.</p> <p>Whatever happened to Leandro Dami\xc3\xa3o?</p> <p>Tottenham are close to wrapping up the signing of Sevilla defender Federico Fazio. They\xe2\x80\x99ll pay \xc2\xa38m for the 27-year-old after finally ridding themselves of Michael Dawson.</p> <p>QPR are after a midfielder who looks flashy for a few moments in every game but who believes in his own hype and has no end product. That midfielder is West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s Mohamed Diam\xc3\xa9.</p> <p>Milan are after a striker. But if they can\xe2\x80\x99t get one, they\xe2\x80\x99ll sign Chelsea klutz Fernando Torres instead.</p>'
