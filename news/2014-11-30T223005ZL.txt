b'Louis van Gaal keen to adapt festive plans after timely win against Hull'


b'<p>After this canter to victory over an insipid Hull City gave Manchester United a third consecutive win for the first time under Louis van Gaal, the manager expressed his concern about the busy festive period.</p> <p>As is the Dutchman\xe2\x80\x99s wont, the protest was delivered in his own particular way as Van Gaal shoehorned in a mention of marital bliss, extended family, and a pastoral concern for his players.</p> <p>Asked if he was pleased with the side\xe2\x80\x99s momentum before Stoke City\xe2\x80\x99s visit on Tuesday evening, Van Gaal answered a different question. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m not happy because I do not agree with that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I cannot change that. Because I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s good for the football players that they play within two days another match.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn the December months, it shall be like that. We also have families. I also have a wife and kids and grandchildren and I cannot see them this Christmas. But I want to work in the Premier League, I have to adapt and I shall adapt. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it is good for players, neither for the families.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>This was more a stern observation than a rant and featured Van Gaal chuckling at least once. Here again, though, was the latest reminder of a dominant personality United\xe2\x80\x99s players continue to respond to in a manner lacking under David Moyes last season.</p> <p>The 63-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s driving determination to always be better, always strive for perfection, showed when denying that a lack of European football gives United an advantage over those around them at the top of the Premier League.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. It depends on the injuries and the other clubs are used to playing in the Champions League,\xe2\x80\x9d said Van Gaal. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot say Chelsea are not used to playing in the Champions League, the Premier League, the League Cup and the FA Cup. They are used to that and they have all those selections for that. When you are challenged during the whole season you become better, and we have to train to become better. It\xe2\x80\x99s a longer way than to play the games against top opponents.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Hull were dominated throughout. Chris Smalling\xe2\x80\x99s first goal since Boxing Day and Wayne Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s fifth of the term arrived in the first half, before a beauty from Robin van Persie suggested that he may soon find form, and kept United in the Champions League berths, 11 points behind Chelsea.</p> <p>Van Gaal said: \xe2\x80\x9cWinning for a top club like Manchester United is the most important thing, especially when we are in fourth position in the league table. We need to win otherwise others will overcome you. Of course I had hoped we would win today, but we have to win also against Stoke.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou see Liverpool struggling against Stoke, only scoring in the 85th minute. Then you see Arsenal struggling also against West Bromwich Albion. They could have lost.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEvery game is difficult. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the Premier League is exciting because you never know. There is also an atmosphere in the stadiums and the fans are always supporting their team until the end \xe2\x80\x93 that\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I want to work in the Premier League, because of the atmosphere.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xc3\x81ngel Di Mar\xc3\xada lasted only 13 minutes before suffering a hamstring injury that rules him out for Stoke and potentially for longer, while Rooney took knocks to a calf and knee, though there is optimism he will be fine.</p> <p>Radamel Falcao came on for a 20-minute cameo following a calf problem and disappointed but despite Di Mar\xc3\xada\xe2\x80\x99s injury, Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s long list of absentees is easing. \xe2\x80\x9cMore players are fit now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>Hull are only separated from the relegation positions by goal difference and they have not won since 4 October. Asked about retaining self-belief, the manager Steve Bruce said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my job, you have to keep believing. I still believe we\xe2\x80\x99re a better team than we were last year.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve still got a long, long way to go. We\xe2\x80\x99ve made four or five changes in the summer and that will improve us, I\xe2\x80\x99m convinced of that. We have to find a formula for winning games but I\xe2\x80\x99m convinced we will.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Man of the match: Robin van Persie (Manchester United)</p>'
