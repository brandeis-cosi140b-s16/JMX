b'Frank Lampard should be welcomed by Chelsea fans, says Harry Redknapp'


b'<p>Harry Redknapp says Chelsea fans have no reason to berate Frank Lampard when he returns to Stamford Bridge with Manchester City for Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s crucial Premier League contest, insisting the home crowd should instead acclaim the midfielder for his years of excellent service for the London club.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe should get an excellent reception, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d said the Queens Park Rangers manager. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s he done wrong? He played for Chelsea for God knows how many years, scored how many goals, won every cup there is to win. Surely he should get a good reception.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Lampard left Chelsea last year after 13 successful years during which he won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, two League Cups and the Champions League in addition to becoming the club\xe2\x80\x99s all-time lead goalscorer. He was not offered a new contract by Chelsea and ended up joining Manchester City in the summer.</p> <p>Redknapp says the fact that Lampard could still play an important role in the title race at the age of 36 is testament to his unique devotion to his profession. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got fantastic drive and determination, far above anybody else I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever met in football,\xe2\x80\x9d said Redknapp, who managed Lampard, his nephew, when the player started his career at West Ham.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe trains harder than anyone I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen by a million miles,\xe2\x80\x9d added Redknapp. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen anyone else come close. When he was 15-16, I\xe2\x80\x99d be sitting at 4 o\xe2\x80\x99clock in my office at West Ham. It would be dark and raining and I\xe2\x80\x99d see somebody 200 yards away and thought it was someone who\xe2\x80\x99d climbed over the fence but it was him doing doggies, dribbling between cones, running with the ball, shooting. Every day. Not one day a week, every day.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Redknapp would not be surprised to see Lampard score against Chelsea again, as he did when equalising for City when the sides met at the Etihad earlier this season. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99ll always score. He\xe2\x80\x99s just got that knack. Anticipation it\xe2\x80\x99s called. He anticipates the ball arriving in the penalty box and he\xe2\x80\x99s on the end of it.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as someone gets wide with the ball he\xe2\x80\x99ll run in there. You\xe2\x80\x99ll see him run in there 15-20 time a game and when the ball comes he\xe2\x80\x99s there to score. He\xe2\x80\x99s got to be one of the all-time great Chelsea players. They\xe2\x80\x99ve had some fantastic players over the years and he\xe2\x80\x99s up there with them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
