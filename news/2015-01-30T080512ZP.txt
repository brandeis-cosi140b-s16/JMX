b'Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend | Paul Doyle'


b'1) Hull and Newcastle both battling doom and gloom  <p>Unless Thergothon, the pioneers of Finnish funeral metal, are about to head out on a resurrection tour, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be hard pressed to find a gloomier band of brooders in England this weekend than the fans of the team who fail to win Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s early kick-off. Hull City are in the grip of an ominous despondency, with the regime unpopular, the injury list cruel and the manager losing faith in key players if Steve Bruce\xe2\x80\x99s public scolding of Allen McGregor and Curtis Davies after the 3-0 defeat at West Ham is anything to go by. One of the few sources of hope for Hull at the moment is a relatively benign run of fixtures (apart from an imminent trip to Manchester City). Five of their next seven matches are against teams who could conceivably finish below them, starting with the game against Newcastle, one of the few clubs as woebegone as the Tigers. Bruce looks likely to deploy Sone Aluko up front and the striker has the speed to trouble Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s plodding defence provided he is given adequate service \xe2\x80\x93 this weekend, then, would be a good time for Tom Huddlestone to rediscover the form that had some people suggesting he was worthy of a place in England\xe2\x80\x99s squad for the last World Cup, or for Robbie Brady or Gast\xc3\xb3n Ram\xc3\xadrez to show they can be relied upon to shoulder creative duties consistently. Victory for the home side would inject much-needed confidence into Hull \xe2\x80\x93 and increase the disillusionment of Newcastle fans who claim John Carver is not the head coach to prevent their season from petering \xe2\x80\x93 or should that be Ashleying? \xe2\x80\x93 out again.</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Newcastle close in on three teenagers but Sissoko hints at exit\xe2\x80\xa2 Newcastle and West Ham club together to fly players home from Africa\xe2\x80\xa2 Ashley faces disciplinary hearing before Scottish FA on 2 March</p>  2) Funky Palace can upset Everton\xe2\x80\x99s mojo <p>Tony Pulis got lucky when he kept Palace up last season and Alan Pardew got lucky when he lost Yannick Bolasie and Mile Jedinak to international duty just after taking charge this season because it enabled him to get Dwight Gayle into the team. That, ladies and gentlemen, is some whopping great cobblers brought to you in association with Neil Warnock, who may not have twigged that the reason Pulis and Pardew got better performances out of the same group of players that struggled under him is that they are better managers than him. If Palace were the reflection of their old manager\xe2\x80\x99s limitations in the first half of the season, they now exude their new boss\xe2\x80\x99 confidence. Pardew has funked them up like a suited Bootsy Collins and suddenly Palace ooze goals and Selhurst Park is a groovy place to be again.</p>           Alan Pardew on Crystal Palace\xe2\x80\x99s new signings    <p>Palace are now on the same number of points as Everton, who could do with relocating their own mojo pronto, otherwise doubts over Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez\xe2\x80\x99s methods will grow. The brittle Everton defence is likely to be given a serious stress test, and Everton will need James McCarthy to slip straight back into his pre-injury form if they are to claim a win.</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Palace sign QPR\xe2\x80\x99s Jordon Mutch and free agent Ameobi\xe2\x80\xa2 Mart\xc3\xadnez not seeking more striking or creative options\xe2\x80\xa2 Everton academy player in hospital after alleged fight</p>            Everton manager Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez: Crystal Palace are dangerous    3) Liverpool have defensive questions to answer. And attacking ones      Pos Team P GD Pts      6 Tottenham Hotspur 22 2 37    7 West Ham 22 10 36    8 Liverpool 22 4 35    9 Swansea 22 -4 30       <p>There are few more infuriating players in the Premier League than Glen Johnson, who has both exceptional speed and a bizarre instinct to slow everything to a standstill when he runs on to the ball. He is a player with oodles of ability but nowhere near as much time as he seems to think when in possession, and he is often caught out by more sprightly opponents. So it said a lot when Brendan Rodgers called on Johnson after Mamadou Sakho got injured against Chelsea on Tuesday. What it said was that Dejan Lovren is still in the dog house. Sakho has been quietly excellent since replacing the injured Croat at Bournemouth in mid-December but now the Frenchman looks set to miss this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s clash with West Ham, who, like Liverpool, are jostling for a top-four finish. It will be interesting to see whether Rodgers picks Johnson ahead of Lovren again. Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s superior mobility suggests he may be more comfortable than Lovren in a back three and also better able to cope with the pace of Diafra Sakho and Enner Valencia, though Lovren should be better equipped to help Martin Skrtel contain Andy Carroll. But those are options that will probably encourage Sam Allardyce more than Liverpool fans. Whichever Rodgers plumps for, he is going to need his forwards to improve their chance-conversion rate if Liverpool are to take three points that would send them above West Ham in the table. Might this be the match that Daniel Sturridge makes a triumphant return?</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Liverpool join transfer window scramble for Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s Ings\xe2\x80\xa2 Balotelli will leave Liverpool for \xe2\x82\xac60m-70m or \xe2\x80\x98die there\xe2\x80\x99, says agent\xe2\x80\xa2 The Rumour Mill: Chelsea target Valencia and Sakho?\xe2\x80\xa2 Newcastle and West Ham combine to fly players home from Africa</p>            West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s Sam Allardyce shrugs off Diafra Sakho\xe2\x80\x99s Africa Cup of Nations ban    4) Are Manchester United going backwards again? <p>Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s 5-3 defeat at Leicester back in September turned out to be pretty misleading. Firstly it suggested that Leicester would steer clear of relegation trouble this season, yet immediately after that victory they slipped into a 13-match winless streak. Now they are bottom of the table, though they have perked up in recent weeks and the early signs are that Andrej Kramaric could help keep them scoring regularly, though Nigel Pearson knows that he needs to sign another creative midfielder as soon as possible, especially with Riyad Mahrez still away with Algeria. United are not what the September match suggested they would be: they remain sloppy, of course, and there are mounting concerns that Louis van Gaal is cramping their style. Some of the Dutchman\xe2\x80\x99s decisions seem perverse \xe2\x80\x93 the removal of \xc3\x81ngel Di Mar\xc3\xada from a position where he had been so influential, for instance, or Phil Jones taking corners \xe2\x80\x93 and he could do with them being vindicated this weekend. They may be fourth in the table at the moment but their performances so far do not suggest they will stay there, as others below them are improving more clearly.</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Man Utd fans must buy Cambridge ticket or miss Sunderland </p>  5) Crouch could be key for Stoke in absence of Krkic      Stoke City\xe2\x80\x99s Bojan Krkic is substituted after picking up a career-threatening injury against Rochdale. Photograph: Matt McNulty/JMP/REX    <p>The loss of Bojan Krkic for the season to knee ligament damage is a sad blow to Stoke and to all neutrals, but it gives QPR additional hope of ending their ridiculous away record. Harry Redknapp might be tempted to try once again to see if he can coax a little Bojan-esque magic out of Adel Taarabt but this is a match that is likely to be played mostly on the wings or in the air, both sides now being short of central creativity. Peter Crouch has not started a home match for Stoke since New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day but he is still a valuable weapon, which is why he was given a new contract this week, and Mark Hughes may unleash him on Saturday bearing in mind how Rangers defenders failed to deal with him when the sides met earlier this season \xe2\x80\x93 although Richard Dunne, or indeed almost anyone, might be expected to cope with Crouch better than Rio Ferdinand did that day.</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Krkic ruled out for season after injuring knee at Rochdale\xe2\x80\xa2 Palace sign QPR\xe2\x80\x99s Mutch\xe2\x80\xa2 Crouch and Whelan sign two-year contract extensions</p>  6) Defoe must start repaying Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s faith <p>Gus Poyet\xe2\x80\x99s gamble has to start paying off quickly. After splashing out on Jermain Defoe, the manager has revamped his whole formation in a bid to play to the striker\xe2\x80\x99s strengths but all he has got by way of early dividend are brief flashes of sharpness and many offside calls. The probable return of Adam Johnson after missing the FA Cup draw against Fulham should help increase supply to Defoe, who needs to begin taking his chances, particularly if Burnley exploit the uncertainty in Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s new three-man backline.</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 How does your team fare on Match of the Day\xe2\x80\x99s running order?\xe2\x80\xa2 Liverpool join transfer window scramble for Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s Ings</p>  7) Injury, suspension and form concerns give Chelsea pause for thought   <div data-embed-type="table" class="player-card player-card--football" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <div class="player-card__image-container">  </div> <div class="player-card__player"> <div class="player-card__position" itemprop="jobTitle">Defender</div> <div class="player-card__name" itemprop="name">Gary Cahill</div> </div> <dl class="player-card__stats"> <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Appearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">21</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots blocked</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">16</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Clearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">119</dd> </dl> </div>   <p>In these times of large versatile squads and tactical tinkering, the notion that a manager has to have a fixed idea of his \xe2\x80\x98best XI\xe2\x80\x99 seems as outmoded as black boots. But Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has been upholding it this term and there is little doubt which one he would like to be able to field against Manchester City this weekend \xe2\x80\x93 except, that is, for one position.</p> <p>Gary Cahill\xe2\x80\x99s recent dip in form, and the continued blossoming of Kurt Zouma, means Mourinho must be in two minds when it comes to deciding who should partner John Terry in central defence. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a decision he can afford to get wrong with Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero lurking. Factor in the injury concern over Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas and the possible suspension of Diego Costa and Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s spine could look very different to their manager\xe2\x80\x99s ideal lineup. If Manchester City, though shorn of Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9, cannot take advantage, then their chances of retaining their title will seem scrawny.</p>  <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Chelsea v Manchester City: big in England but does anyone else care?\xe2\x80\xa2 Mourinho puts Chelsea into lockdown after Costa stamp charge\xe2\x80\xa2 Chelsea close on \xc2\xa323.3m Cuadrado \xe2\x80\xa2 Inter poised to make summer bid for Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\xa2 Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Sinclair set to join Aston Villa on loan</p>  8) Swansea have a tough Sunday afternoon ahead of them           Matt Le Tissier\xe2\x80\x99s top three goals \xe2\x80\x93 brick-by-brick    <p>Swansea look set to sign Jack Cork but that nifty player is likely to be all they get from Southampton this week. With Wilfried Bony sold and Gylfii Sigurdsson suspended, Garry Monk has plenty to meditate on. It is difficult to see how the Welsh side can pierce the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s best defence, especially as Maya Yoshida has returned from international duty and could start instead of Florin Gardos, who was found wanting against Crystal Palace as he tried to replace Toby Alderweireld. Sadio Man\xc3\xa9 is also back, but, despite his fine form prior to departing for the Africa Cup of Nations, he may not be cast straight back into the starting line-up given Eljero Elia\xe2\x80\x99s impressive displays in his absence. But he\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be ready to spring from the bench if Saints need a goal.</p>           Matt Le Tissier: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve never drunk a pint of lager in my life\xe2\x80\x99    9) Could the new free-scoring (ish) Villa trouble Arsenal? <p>For most of this season it has seemed like Aston Villa\xe2\x80\x99s plan to avoid relegation has consisted of being so boring that people will block them out of their minds and not even notice them when they look at the table. But then the club went and signed Carles Gil from Valencia and the new recruit immediately flashed his creative potential by ramming in a spectacular opener as Villa went completely goal-crazy against Bournemouth last week, hitting two (TWO!) in one game. Then Fabian Delph banished all rumours of a January departure by signing a bumper new contract at the club and suddenly Villa look interesting again. A couple of weeks ago even the most gloomy Arsenal fans would have had this fixture down as a big home win but now, well, the chances of that win could be narrower.</p>           Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger hopes Arsenal can put a run of results together in the fight for a top-four place     <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Sinclair set to join Aston Villa on loan\xe2\x80\xa2 Wenger warns Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez is uncertain to face Aston Villa\xe2\x80\xa2 Lambert given full backing of Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner\xe2\x80\xa2 The Diaby dilemma: should Arsenal him a new contract?</p>  10) Eriksen the key to unlocking West Brom   <div data-embed-type="table" class="player-card player-card--football" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person"> <div class="player-card__image-container">  </div> <div class="player-card__player"> <div class="player-card__position" itemprop="jobTitle">Midfielder</div> <div class="player-card__name" itemprop="name">Christian Eriksen</div> </div> <dl class="player-card__stats"> <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Appearances</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">22</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Goals</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">8</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">63</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Shots on target</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">27%</dd>  <dt class="player-card__stat-name">Offsides</dt> <dd class="player-card__stat-value">0</dd> </dl> </div>   <p>Stifling Cristian Eriksen is tantamount to neutering Tottenham Hotspur. Pulis surely knows this and will probably entrust the operation to Claudio Yacob, the Argentine dynamo whom he has rehabilitated since taking over at the Hawthorns. After being overlooked by Alan Irvine, Yacob has found the form that he showed in his first season at the club and, under Pulis, re-affirmed his ability to knit together his own team\xe2\x80\x99s play while tearing up the opposition\xe2\x80\x99s. He could become what Jedinak was to Pulis\xe2\x80\x99 Crystal Palace. So, to win this game, Spurs will have to display authentic top-four credentials.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Eriksen steers Spurs to final and warns of Chelsea \xe2\x80\x98revenge\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\xa2 McManaman joins West Brom on three-and-a-half year deal</p>      Pos Team P GD Pts      1 Chelsea 22 32 52    2 Man City 22 23 47    3 Southampton 22 21 42    4 Man Utd 22 15 40    5 Arsenal 22 14 39    6 Tottenham Hotspur 22 2 37    7 West Ham 22 10 36    8 Liverpool 22 4 35    9 Swansea 22 -4 30    10 Stoke 22 -4 29    11 Newcastle 22 -9 27    12 Everton 22 -4 23    13 Crystal Palace 22 -8 23    14 West Brom 22 -9 22    15 Aston Villa 22 -14 22    16 Sunderland 22 -14 20    17 Burnley 22 -15 20    18 Hull 22 -10 19    19 QPR 22 -16 19    20 Leicester 22 -14 17     '
