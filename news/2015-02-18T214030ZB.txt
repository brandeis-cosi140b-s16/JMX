b'Basel 1-1 FC Porto \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened! | Alan Smith'


b'<p>Two goals, nine yellow cards, both sides content that they are very much in with an even enough shout of progressing. You would fancy Porto on the evidence available here, though \xe2\x80\x93 they dominated in possession only to find Basel\xe2\x80\x99s defensive wall very difficult to break down. Man of the match: Mark Clattenburg. That\xe2\x80\x99s all for me. Thanks for reading. Bye!</p>'
