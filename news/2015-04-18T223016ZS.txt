b'Saturday Sundae: All rosy in Eden\xe2\x80\x99s garden but Leo still reigns in Spain'


b'MAN OF THE DAY <p>There shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really be much debate about the player of the season and Eden Hazard displayed once again why that is with a glorious finish for Chelsea.</p> Goal of the day <p>They might have only drawn in the end, but Bournemouth\xe2\x80\x99s Matt Ritchie produced a moment of magical power by slamming a shot in from way, way, way out against Sheffield Wednesday.</p> STAT OF THE DAY <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to let the relentless flow of records from Leo Messi wash over you but a 400th goal for Barcelona was something special.</p> Stand-in of the day <p>Leonardo Ulloa didn\xe2\x80\x99t think he was playing half an hour before the kick-off of Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s game against Swansea but an injury to David Nugent thrust him into the action, and he opened the scoring after just 15 minutes. Be prepared, kids.</p> GAME OF THE DAY <p>The reputation of the Championship as the go-to division for excitement and entertaining defending was held up by Huddersfield and Derby, who combined for a pulsating 4-4 draw, with both teams throwing away the lead only to equalise.</p> TURNAROUND OF THE DAY <p>Last season Leyton Orient skipped past MK Dons 3-1 on the way to the League One play-offs. This time they lost 6-1, possibly on their way to relegation.</p> BRIBE ATTEMPT OF THE DAY <p>After Heerenveen\xe2\x80\x99s Joey van den Berg jokingly suggested 10 cases of beer would be enough for them to throw their game against PSV, some Eindhoven fans cheekily took 20 to the game. Van den Berg politely declined but PSV won 4-1 to take the title.</p>'
