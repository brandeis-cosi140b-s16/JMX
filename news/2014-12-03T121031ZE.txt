b'Emmanuel Petit: arrogant French don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve Thierry Henry'


b'<p>The retired France midfielder Emmanuel Petit has criticised his country for its \xe2\x80\x9chypocritical and cowardly\xe2\x80\x9d treatment of his former Arsenal team-mate Thierry Henry and suggested it may have been better if they had been \xe2\x80\x9coverrun\xe2\x80\x9d by Germany in the second world war.</p> <p>Petit played alongside Henry in the team that won the 1998 World Cup on home soil and spent three years at Arsenal from 1997 to 2000.</p> <p>His comments come in the wake of Henry\xe2\x80\x99s announcement that he is to leave New York Red Bulls after four and a half years in the MLS. Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s record scorer has not yet confirmed if he will retire from professional football, stating he would \xe2\x80\x9ctake the next few weeks\xe2\x80\x9d to decide on his next move.</p> <p>Asked for his favourite memories of his former team-mate, the question sparked an outburst from Petit about the perception of Henry in the national media.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn England, they\xe2\x80\x99ve built a statue of Thierry,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the French website sports.fr. \xe2\x80\x9cThat means a lot. He is revered there. This bad image [in the French press] of Thierry Henry, it annoys me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can we reproach Henry for? His handball against Ireland? He helped France qualify for the World Cup in South Africa. He has done nothing.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFrance is hypocritical and cowardly. Sometimes I think that if we\xe2\x80\x99d been overrun by the Germans, we\xe2\x80\x99d be better run.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Petit continued his rant by comparing Thierry Henry\xe2\x80\x99s treatment by the French media to Wayne Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s in the English press.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWayne Rooney is not hated in England, even though he was not always right in his boots on the field and off. Thierry Henry never had a bad move on the pitch and there were no stories in his private life,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not hated but he\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not loved. He got screwed by the French press after his handball and has since not spoken to the French media.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIn France, he has no collusion with the press, so what? Perhaps because he was not smiling when he scored for Les Bleus! Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s what I hate in this country.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI have great difficulty with the French, I have never seen such arrogant, smug, lying and hypocritical people.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Petit made 85 appearances for Arsenal and scored nine goals before joining Barcelona in 2000. He finished his playing career at Chelsea, retiring in 2004.</p> <p>Henry gave an interview to the French sports magazine L\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\x89quipe as part of the publication\xe2\x80\x99s 100-page special on the Arsenal legend. Speaking about his future, he expressed a desire to stay in football and said that he \xe2\x80\x9cwould like to see Arsenal win the Champions League\xe2\x80\x9d, while Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger said this week that he will \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly\xe2\x80\x9d return to the club one day.</p> <p>Petit made 85 appearances for Arsenal and scored nine goals before joining Barcelona in 2000.
