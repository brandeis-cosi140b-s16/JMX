b'Football rumours: Rafael Ben\xc3\xadtez to rejoin Liverpool?'


b'<p>When he was out of work, rumour had it that Rafael Ben\xc3\xadtez used to stroll into Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s training ground with his dog Nelson \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9dgreat man, great dog\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 and engage in witty repartee with Roy Hodgson, the fella who nicked his job. They really did like to see Benitez at first, although there came a time when they wondered whether it was appropriate for him to keep coming in. But the visits soon stopped. Ben\xc3\xadtez started a blog. He won a blogging award, which convinced Chelsea to hire him. Then Napoli lured him to Italy last year and the future looked bright again but now Ben\xc3\xadtez is hinting that he will leave Naples at the end of the season, leading to speculation that he is set for a glorious return to Liverpool. His odds have been slashed to 6-1. No one tell Brendan Rodgers. That poor man.</p> <p>Meanwhile Ben\xc3\xadtez has announced that Mario Balotelli will not be joining Napoli. Well, duh. It all makes sense now. He wants him to be his new Dirk Kuyt, his Crouchigol, his Morientesgol, his new Lord of the Manor of Frodsham.</p> <p>Speaking of people who want to leave Italy for England, apparently Milan\xe2\x80\x99s Nnamdi Oduamadi has said that it would be a dream come true for him to join Crystal Palace. Clearly this is a cry for help. Someone alert the authorities.</p> <p>Luka Modric\xe2\x80\x99s thigh injury means that Arsenal and Chelsea will not be signing Sami Khedira from Real Madrid in January. But they can still have some transfer market fun! After all, they both want Bayern Munich\xe2\x80\x99s Xherdan Shaqiri. So do Liverpool. Shaqiri will be off to Chelsea, then.</p> <p>Not to worry, Arsenal fans. You\xe2\x80\x99re going to be spending some money - \xc2\xa360m on the Porto pair of Jackson Mart\xc3\xadnez and Juan Fernando Quintero, \xc2\xa324m on Sevilla\xe2\x80\x99s Gregorz Krychowiak, \xc2\xa35m on Marcelo Brozovic and \xc2\xa30.00 on a new defender, which should keep Arsenal Fan TV entertaining.</p> <p>And finally, Tottenham continue to show their customary lack of imagination by targeting Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s Jay Rodriguez. Honestly, will they ever get bored with plundering that club? It seems not, but Southampton are ready to put up a fight and want Andros Townsend and Harry Kane in return. Daniel Levy is frowning. Be afraid.</p>'
