b'<p>Manuel Pellegrini has admitted he is open to extending Frank Lampard\xe2\x80\x99s loan at Manchester City beyond January.</p> <p>Lampard joined New York City from Chelsea in the summer before moving to the Etihad on a six-month deal. The 36-year-old scored against his former club on Sunday to  earn the champions a point against Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side and now Pellegrini has acknowledged that Lampard could stay longer with the MLS season not starting until March.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I can\xe2\x80\x99t answer about that in this moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pellegrini before the Capital One Cup tie against Sheffield Wednesday.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFrank will stay until January because until January he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to do in the United States because they are not working. In January we will see what is happening and we will make a decision thenPellegrini also confirmed David Silva and Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero will miss Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s game but are expected to be fit for Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Hull. The striker Stevan Jovetic is also in line to return for next week\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League match with Roma because of a hamstring injury.</p> <p>Lampard could start for City against Wednesday at the Etihad and without a win in their last four games City could do with a victory.</p> <p>Pellegrini said fortune has not been on City\xe2\x80\x99s side. \xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all, we were very unlucky not to win one of those games but of course when you don\xe2\x80\x99t win, you have some problems you must improve.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut [am I] worried about the team? No, because I think we are not playing bad. Especially in the games against Arsenal and Chelsea we played really well.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe against Bayern we didn\xe2\x80\x99t play the 90 minutes in the way I like the team to do it but it is not easy to play against Bayern away. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t do a bad game. But it is important for us to start getting three points in every game.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini also played down reports of City being interested in signing Everton\xe2\x80\x99s midfielder Ross Barkley. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t talk about rumours. We are not trying to bring anyone to our squad. We have an important restriction on money and the amount of players we can have in our squad. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where the news comes from but for here in Manchester City we have the squad. I am not looking at any other players.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pellegrini will urge his players to treat Sheffield Wednesday with respect, as they are coming off a good run and City were victims to Championship opponents in the FA Cup last season, when Wigan won at the Etihad.</p> <p>He said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you play against a Championship team it is very difficult, the motivation is not the same and they always try to come here and win. Last season, we were eliminated here in the FA Cup against Wigan, a Championship team.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe won the Capital One Cup last year and we hope tomorrow we can start in the same way we played in the competition, conceding I think just one goal [en route to the final] and winning all the games.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSheffield Wednesday have lost just one in the last 10 games, they but I am sure the team will be conscious of what we have to do if we want to continue in the Capital One Cup.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
