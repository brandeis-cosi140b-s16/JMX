b'Arsenal v Newcastle United: match preview'


b'<p>Newcastle begin an important week with a visit to one of their bogey teams. They have beaten Arsenal only once in 17 meetings and Alan Pardew has lost on each of his three visits with the club to the Emirates. The 7-3 defeat in December 2012 was sobering but Newcastle are in confident mood after beating Chelsea and they want another tonic before the Capital One Cup tie at Tottenham and the derby against Sunderland next Sunday.
