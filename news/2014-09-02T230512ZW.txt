b'<p>\xe2\x80\x9cWith the news of 15-year-old Norwegian Martin Odegaard being called up to the senior squad, we inch closer and closer to the moment when the first footballer born in the 21st century plays an international match,\xe2\x80\x9d notices Alexandre Queir\xc3\xb3s. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that raises the question: who was the first footballer born in the 90s to be capped for his country?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Certain events are guaranteed to make you feel a little old \xe2\x80\x93 twinges in your hip, Mars bars getting smaller, things being far more expensive than they used to be \xe2\x80\x93 but nothing quite brings it home like the birthdates of professional footballers. You can be wandering along, enjoying your day, and then \xe2\x80\x93 bang \xe2\x80\x93 you notice someone who was born in 1999 making their debut for Rochdale. So if you\xe2\x80\x99re getting towards the age where you feel that career as a footballer/video-game tester/astronaut/president might not happen, then brace yourself. This might be a difficult couple of paragraphs.</p> <p>Several of you got in touch to point us towards the ever-excellent RSSSF\xe2\x80\x99s page of youngest internationals. They suggest that MacDonald Taylor Jr\xe2\x80\x99s debut for the US Virgin Islands against the Dominican Republic on 1 October 2006 was the first by any player born in the 1990s, Taylor Jr having been born on 22 March 1992.</p> <p>But, wait a second, here\xe2\x80\x99s Tim Dockery: \xe2\x80\x9cThe first Fifa capped footballer to be born in the 1990s was Ver\xc3\xb3nica Charlyn Corral,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes. \xe2\x80\x9cBorn in September 1991, she represented Mexico in a 3-0 loss to the United States on 23 October 2005. If you go outside of Fifa, you could count Serena Guthrie as the first. Born on 5 January 1990, she represented Jersey in a 3-1 loss to Guernsey on 26 June 2005.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>And Tim\xe2\x80\x99s on a roll: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I am allowed to answer a question that was not asked, the first soccer player born in the 1980s to be capped must surely be Ghana\xe2\x80\x99s Stephen Appiah who was born on December 24, 1980. On November 12, 1995, he represented his country in a 2-0 win over Sierra Leone at the age of 14 years and 323 days.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSkipping the 1970s and the 1960s, I reckon that the first soccer player to be born in the 1950s to be capped was Allan \xe2\x80\x98Skill\xe2\x80\x99 Cole who was born in October 1950. On 13 June 1966, he represented Jamaica in a 1-0 loss to Mexico. He did not go on to have a stellar soccer career, but at least he is credited with co-writing the Bob Marley song \xe2\x80\x98War\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Odegaard, if he does indeed make his Norway debut, could take the new mantle of the most-recently-born international from the hands of Northern Mariana Islands tyro Joel Fruit, who is an international footballer despite being born on 31 May 1998, just before the World Cup in France. Odegaard was born on 17 December 1998.</p> <p>And after all that, we need a stiff drink \xe2\x80\x93 something for which, conveniently enough, you do need to be a certain age.</p> CAPTAIN CAROUSEL <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI noticed that the armband was passed on twice in Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s 0-0 draw against Besiktas in Turkey,\xe2\x80\x9d emails Peter O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the record for a single game?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Andrew Beasley points us towards the halycon days of 2003, when all this were fields, you could leave your front door unlocked when you went on holiday, and Sven Goran Eriksson was England manager.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBack in the days when Sven was able to change an entire team at half-time and hand out caps like confetti, England had four captains in a match against Serbia &amp; Montenegro in 2003,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Andrew. \xe2\x80\x9cSurely the likes of Beckham, Gerrard and rest of the infamous Golden Generation made up the four? Nope \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Michael Owen began the friendly, being played at Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s then Walkers Stadium, with the armband but, like half the team, he was substituted at the interval. Emile Heskey then took over the duties until the 61st minute, when he was replaced by Darius Vassell and the armband went to Phil Neville. Still with us? Good. Neville survived until the 88th minute when he was replaced by James Beattie, winning the second of his five caps, at which point Jamie Carragher, who had sprung from the bench midway through the second half, was made captain.</p> <p>Has anyone named more than four captains in a single game? Let us know at the usual address \xe2\x80\x93 knowledge@theguardian.com</p> IN SHIRT SUPPLY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cManchester United\xe2\x80\x99s club shop has reportedly run out of the letter \xe2\x80\x98r\xe2\x80\x99 for their replica shirt printing,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Gareth Eales. \xe2\x80\x9cAre there other instances of similar football club-shop bother?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Why yes, and where else to take you once again than 2003? It\xe2\x80\x99s not yet another grasping excuse for The Knowledge to glug greedily from the fountain of eternal youth: 2003 really does have all the answers this week, and this one in fact owes plenty to a current Manchester United stalwart.</p> <p>Wayne Rooney played for Everton back then, the precocious young buck making his full England debut at 17 that February. \xe2\x80\x9cRoo-mania\xe2\x80\x9d was sweeping the nation, and not in the way certain modern scaremongerers would have it. When England released yet another new shirt that spring, just in time to rise the wave of fans\xe2\x80\x99 enthusiasm for absolutely no major tournament whatsoever, its sellers got far more than they had bargained for. \xe2\x80\x9cRooney 9\xe2\x80\x9d was the nation\xe2\x80\x99s shirt du jour, and the letters \xe2\x80\x93 as they do \xe2\x80\x93 flew off the shelves, laying bare a chronic shortage of letter Ys. That was the case in Liverpool, at least, although you would imagine that by August of the following year the lucky souls who got hold of one were more than happy to return them to the mix. Aflame.</p> <p>Is the letter Y jinxed? Or perhaps just rare: there are only two of them in a Scrabble set. Cardiff City fans were left pondering this in 2010 when Craig Bellamy signed for his hometown club amid an understandable tide of local-boy-made-good emotion. The poor club shop assistant was forced to explain exactly why fans would have to make do with \xe2\x80\x9cBellam\xe2\x80\x9d if they wanted their shirt now, now, now. At least Cardiff fans were magnanimous in their disappointment: \xe2\x80\x9cDespite not having his name on their shirt,\xe2\x80\x9d reads the Wales Online article, \xe2\x80\x9cJulie still has a lot of faith in Bellamy and believes he can take Cardiff City to the very top.\xe2\x80\x9d There, and back again. Y bother?</p> <p>After Y comes Z, though, and they can keep each other company here. It may seem less than plausible now, but Aston Villa\xe2\x80\x99s club shop really did once run out of Charles N\xe2\x80\x99Zogbia Zs. According to the man himself, anyway. We\xe2\x80\x99re told by Stefan Glosby that something similarly, and rather more understandably, occurred when Gianfranco Zola signed for Chelsea in 1996, too, but the interweb isn\xe2\x80\x99t clever enough to stand that up for us.</p> <p>Time to delve into some weightier apocrypha, and Crystal Palace will feel the force of our determined dredging for the next minute or two. First up is a tale from Eleanor Drywood, who tells us: \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you might be interested in a predicament faced by the Crystal Palace club shop in 2001 due to the increasing popularity of club legend and Finnish international Aki Riihilahti.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>We are, so please continue.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAt the end of his first season with the club, the shop found they could not meet the demand for the letter \xe2\x80\x98i\xe2\x80\x99, which appears no less than four times in his surname. Their solution? The club asked Riihilahti if he would change the name on the back of his shirt to Aki, quartering the demand for \xe2\x80\x98i\xe2\x80\x99s. As I recall, he refused on the basis that he was proud to wear his surname on his shirt. He went on to spend a further five seasons at Palace, so I can only assume a regular bulk order of \xe2\x80\x98i\xe2\x80\x99s was placed with the supplier.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Very nterestng ndeed \xe2\x80\x93 and perhaps inspiration for the increasing number of current-day players to choose abbreviated names with little obvious need.</p> <p>OK, so this next one involves an extra letter, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a comic caper of the highest order \xe2\x80\x93 within the obvious limits of these things \xe2\x80\x93 so we\xe2\x80\x99ll include it anyway. In 2004, upon their return to the Premier League and just three years after Riihilahti\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98i\xe2\x80\x99s didn\xe2\x80\x99t have it at all, Crystal Palace managed to misspell their own name on their shirts. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe the chant by the Selhurst Park crowd at the time went along the lines of \xe2\x80\x98there\xe2\x80\x99s only one H in Palace\xe2\x80\x99, chuckles Padraig Fox. \xe2\x80\x9cApparently the club offered to exchange the shirt for free, but the two Palace fans I know kept theirs as a constant reminder of \xe2\x80\x98typical Palace\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d Typical Palace, eh?</p> <p>Because we\xe2\x80\x99re nice, we\xe2\x80\x99ll finish with a personal touch from Peter Newbitt. \xe2\x80\x9cFor my 18th birthday, my uncle Martyn and his family bought me a West Ham away shirt with \xe2\x80\x98Newbitt, 18\xe2\x80\x99 to be emblazoned across the back,\xe2\x80\x9d he speaks through sepia. \xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately, West Ham ran out of the number 1 so it remains numberless to this day. Which at least spared me the indignity of having the number of West Ham fans\xe2\x80\x99 public enemy number one and England\xe2\x80\x99s newest retiree on the back of my shirt for the next fifteen years.\xe2\x80\x9d He means Frank Lampard, everyone.</p> KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHas a goalkeeper ever been booked or sent off for diving?\xe2\x80\x9d asks Allam Jeeawody back in 2007.</p> <p>Where better to start the search than with Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Jens Lehmann? He collected eight yellow cards in the Premier League last season, but the best of the lot came at Chelsea when he got up Didier Drogba\xe2\x80\x99s nose by pushing him while the referee had turned his back. Drogba dived pathetically, leapt to his feet and went for revenge with a barge. Lehmann also went down and both players were booked.</p> <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s probably worth mentioning the infamous incident involving Chile\xe2\x80\x99s Roberto Rojas, a flare and some fake blood, as reported in this previous Knowledge column, but Luis Vallesp\xc3\xadn\xe2\x80\x99s story about the Real Madrid goalkeeper Paco Buyo comes closest to a goalkeeper booking for diving. \xe2\x80\x9cReal were playing Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid in December 1988 and Atl\xc3\xa9tico\xe2\x80\x99s Paolo Futre was sent off for punching Buyo,\xe2\x80\x9d declares Luis. \xe2\x80\x9cBut TV replays showed Buyo had fallen to the floor without being punched so he was suspended.\xe2\x80\x9d Lehmann would be proud.</p> <p>For thousands more questions and answers take a trip through the Knowledge archive.</p> Can you help? <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhat with Portsmouth only narrowly avoiding dropping into the Conference and Southampton enjoying a great season in the Premier League, I was wondering if there are any other examples of rival clubs enjoying such extreme changes of fortune in such a short period of time,\xe2\x80\x9d begins Andrew Chambers. \xe2\x80\x9cIn 2007-08 Portsmouth were eighth in the Premier League (and won the FA Cup) and Southampton 20th in the second tier \xe2\x80\x93 a difference of 32 places in Portsmouth\xe2\x80\x99s favour. Six years later, in 2013-14, Southampton were eighth in the Premier League and Portsmouth 13th in the fourth tier - a difference of 72 places in Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s favour. There are other footballing rivalries I can think of where one club declines, but none where there has been such dramatic swings of fortune within just a few years. Can anyone beat this?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhich clubs have been forced to wear shirts with another club\xe2\x80\x99s name on them?\xe2\x80\x9d wonders Wayne Ziants. \xe2\x80\x9cTwenty years ago Lazio\xe2\x80\x99s shirts were emblazoned with the name of their city rivals when their sponsor was Banco di Roma. A similar thing happened around the same time to Norwich (Norwich &amp; Peterborough Building Society, IIRC), and there must be more examples \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHaving been taken off on a tangent by Wikipedia, not for the first time, I arrived at the page of Guy Roux,\xe2\x80\x9d begins Eamonn Kelly. \xe2\x80\x9cReading on I saw that Roux had resigned from RC Lens during a 2-1 loss to Strasbourg. Upon further investigation I discovered that he actually resigned after the game but my interest in the subject was piqued and hence my question: have any managers resigned from their posts during a game? (Rather than been fired, which we\xe2\x80\x99ve covered before \xe2\x80\x93 Knowledge Ed)\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAs of 1 September two teams \xe2\x80\x93 Blackpool in the Championship and Crewe Alexandra in League One \xe2\x80\x93 are yet to win a point, both having played five games,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Ed Richardson. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the longest losing streak at the start of a season in the Premier League or Football League?\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Send your questions and answers to the lovely people at knowledge@theguardian.com</p>'
