b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s former scout returns to Chelsea in search of an upset'


b'<p>As someone who once worked for Chelsea under Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho, watching upcoming opponents and players across Europe, Steve Walsh knows just how thorough the Portuguese will be when it comes to preparing his team for the visit of Leicester City on Saturday. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll know every blade of grass that we\xe2\x80\x99ve covered, every set piece. He\xe2\x80\x99ll know exactly what we\xe2\x80\x99re about and he\xe2\x80\x99ll probably second-guess our team,\xe2\x80\x9d Walsh says, smiling.</p> <p>Walsh is Leicester\xe2\x80\x99s joint assistant manager as well as the club\xe2\x80\x99s head of recruitment. He turns up for this interview with a suitcase in his hand, after an overseas scouting trip. A former school teacher who played non-league football for Morecambe, Chorley and Leyland Motors, Walsh has an interesting back story that includes spending 16 years working for Chelsea, going back to the early 1990s, when Ian Porterfield was manager.</p> <p>The brother of Mickey \xe2\x80\x93 who spent six seasons with Porto and will be remembered by older generations for scoring Match of the Day\xe2\x80\x99s goal of the season for Blackpool against Sunderland in 1975 \xe2\x80\x93 Walsh scouted for Bury and Chester before getting his break at Chelsea.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cGwyn Williams took me on. He was Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s assistant manager at the time. I did the opposition match analysis but also did some scouting as well,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI was still teaching but I was paid decently for part-time work. Towards the end I was getting on a plane on a Friday after school, getting back on a Sunday and then going straight back to school again on the Monday. I think at that point it was decided I would finally make the plunge.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Although Mourinho was in charge when he accepted the chance to go full time, Walsh reported to Andr\xc3\xa9 Villas-Boas, who was responsible for opposition scouting. He remains close to the former Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur manager and believes that the man who is now in charge of Zenit St Petersburg was ahead of his time with some of his ideas, even if there were a few teething problems.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAndr\xc3\xa9 was a real techno-kid. He designed a software program using CorelDRAW and wanted me to use it,\xe2\x80\x9d Walsh says. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you were doing a diagram on team shape, you had to move the players into place. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy now with what is available but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in those days. Andr\xc3\xa9 produced little players and you had to move them. But sometimes you would move the torso and the hands would stay or the number would move! The only trouble was that all the drop-down boxes were in Portuguese. I think I had been to watch Barcelona, because we were playing them in the Champions League, and I lost a complete night\xe2\x80\x99s sleep just trying to work out this program.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Scouting assignments required great attention to detail, something that Walsh believes is a hallmark of Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s work \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s very methodical, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t leave anything to chance\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 and extended well beyond identifying formations and set-piece routines. \xe2\x80\x98What is their preferred method of attack? If that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work, what\xe2\x80\x99s the second method and the third? How many times do they give it to the left centre-back or do they always give it to the right centre-back because he\xe2\x80\x99s better on the ball?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Walsh also looked at prospective signings from time to time and his name has been mentioned in relation to Didier Drogba and Michael Essien, as well as Gianfranco Zola and Tore Andre Flo. He is quick to stress, however, that he was a cog in a big wheel. \xe2\x80\x9cI was part of the process, in the same way that the scouts that work for me are now. I went to see Drogba and Essien, as well as the other two, so you hope that the information that you relayed was [valued].\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>In 2006 Walsh accepted an offer to become chief scout under Sam Allardyce at Newcastle, which is where he met Nigel Pearson. When Pearson became Leicester manager in 2008, Walsh joined him and the two returned to the club in 2011, along with Craig Shakespeare, the other joint assistant, after a spell at Hull City in between.</p> <p>The trio have enjoyed great success at Leicester, culminating in promotion to the Premier League as champions last season. \xe2\x80\x9cNigel makes the decisions,\xe2\x80\x9d Walsh says, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I would say he makes informed decisions based on a lot of knowledge from a lot of people, so it\xe2\x80\x99s a real collegiate approach.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Recruitment has been shrewd. Walsh has good contacts at Manchester United \xe2\x80\x93 a steady stream of players have been brought in from Old Trafford \xe2\x80\x93 and they have plucked a couple of gems from French football, in Anthony Knockaert and Riyad Mahrez. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople think \xe2\x80\x98Moneybags Leicester\xe2\x80\x99 but that\xe2\x80\x99s wrong. Our spend record is good,\xe2\x80\x9d Walsh says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve bought one player [Leonardo Ulloa, \xc2\xa38m from Brighton] in so far this summer.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ulloa had been on the radar for a while. \xe2\x80\x9cI watched him quite a lot, the first time against [Nottingham] Forest and I came away thinking: \xe2\x80\x99He\xe2\x80\x99s not bad, I need to keep an eye on him\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d Walsh says. \xe2\x80\x9cSo we had him watched quite a few times, and then after all our players had been out celebrating [promotion] we played Brighton at home and he took advantage \xe2\x80\x93 he beasted us. I said to the two centre-halves, Marcin Wasilewski and Wes [Morgan]: \xe2\x80\x99Who is the hardest forward you\xe2\x80\x99ve had to mark this season in the Championship?\xe2\x80\x99 They both said Ulloa.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>For Walsh, who sits alongside Pearson in the stand at matches rather than on the bench, the trip to Stamford Bridge will bring back a few memories and also raise the possibility of exchanging a few words with Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cWill he seek me out? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I hope he remembers me,\xe2\x80\x9d Walsh says, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll make a point of trying to see him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The level of post-match hospitality may well depend on the result. \xe2\x80\x9cChelsea played really well against Burnley but I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to the game,\xe2\x80\x9d Walsh says.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll treat all our opponents with respect this season but not fear them. And we\xe2\x80\x99ll try and impose the way we play, whether against Chelsea or anyone else. We\xe2\x80\x99re not a team that parks the bus. We\xe2\x80\x99ll try to win the game. That\xe2\x80\x99s Nigel\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
