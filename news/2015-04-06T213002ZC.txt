b'Chris Ramsey puts friendship with Tim Sherwood aside to keep QPR up'


b'<p>For Chris Ramsey and Tim Sherwood, there is one ideal scenario that could yet play out this season. If Queens Park Rangers and Aston Villa both avoid relegation from the Premier League, the two friends will be able to share their regular pint together and bask in mutual success.</p> <p>Friendship, though, will be put aside on Tuesday night when they meet for a pivotal game at the foot of the division. QPR, resurgent after a fine 4-1 victory at West Bromwich Albion, will go above Villa if they win, with Sherwood\xe2\x80\x99s side having been dragged back into the fight.</p> <p>It is a twist of fate that Ramsey and Sherwood should meet in such circumstances. Having worked together for many years at Tottenham, and with Sherwood so close to joining Rangers as manager earlier in the season, a year ago neither would have predicted the current scenario.</p> <p>Ramsey\xe2\x80\x99s task is certainly more challenging than his counterpart\xe2\x80\x99s, and there have already been suggestions that he could join up with Sherwood should his QPR reign end this summer. However, the result at the Hawthorns has provided genuine optimism that a late salvage job can be achieved this year, despite many weeks where hope has appeared forlorn.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDo I see myself working with Tim in the future? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know, I would say yes but I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s not in the near future,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ramsey. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be strange because we\xe2\x80\x99ll probably have a pint later in the week. I\xe2\x80\x99m going there as a representative of Queens Park Rangers and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he will be doing the same as regards Aston Villa. The game really isn\xe2\x80\x99t about me and Tim, it\xe2\x80\x99s about Aston Villa versus Queens Park Rangers.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Asked what made his partnership with Sherwood so effective, Ramsey added: \xe2\x80\x9cI think we are quite measured in how we bounce off each other. So as much as we appear to be bad cop and bad cop, I\xe2\x80\x99m not really that bad a cop with the players. I haven\xe2\x80\x99t given out that many real rollickings since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been here.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why we work so well together. It\xe2\x80\x99s more the fact that he knows that if I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with something that he\xe2\x80\x99s put forward, then I\xe2\x80\x99m going to give him an opinion that may be different. Sometimes he\xe2\x80\x99ll take it and sometimes he won\xe2\x80\x99t, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t have yes man around you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He added: \xe2\x80\x9cConsidering we worked together for four-five years before, there is going to be some sort of strange feeling. But Tim\xe2\x80\x99s Tim, he\xe2\x80\x99s the manager of another team. I block that out of my head. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to play on the front foot, that\xe2\x80\x99s how I am and that\xe2\x80\x99s what we\xe2\x80\x99ll do.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Before Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s victory, Ramsey\xe2\x80\x99s tenure at QPR had provided only one league win. Given that he was not Tony Fernandes\xe2\x80\x99 first-choice replacement for Harry Redknapp in February, questions regarding his future security have already been raised.</p> <p>Yet three points at Villa Park would drag Rangers out of the bottom three and above their opponents, something Ramsey described as a potentially significant boost for his side. Eduardo Vargas is out for the rest of the season for Rangers having sustained a knee injury at the Hawthorns, while the South Korean defender Yun Suk-young will also miss out after a head injury against West Bromwich.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThat [a win] would be a fantastic boost for us because it would see us above the line,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ramsey. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would give the fans a lot of hope that we have a chance of staying up and obviously it will give us a lot of hope for the game against Chelsea on Sunday. We\xe2\x80\x99re just looking to get a positive result tomorrow.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cTim\xe2\x80\x99s very good at what he does and he\xe2\x80\x99s got some good people around him, Tony Parks, Mark Robson, people that can help him. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that he will keep them up and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure he\xe2\x80\x99ll do well for them in the future. What I\xe2\x80\x99m looking at from our point of view is that he keeps them up and we keep ourselves up, and that we are able to play them in the Premier League next season.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
