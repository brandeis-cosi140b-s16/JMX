b'AFC Wimbledon v Liverpool <p>Venue Kingsmeadow, Monday 7.55pm</p> <p>Ref J Moss</p> <p>Odds AFC Wimbledon 14-1 Liverpool 1-4 Draw 6-1</p> <p>Perhaps the most evocative tie of the round, stirring memories of 1988 as well as putting a spotlight on the refounded Dons\xe2\x80\x99 remarkable rise. Wimbledon won both their League Two matches over the festive period and will test a Liverpool side now preparing for life without their captain, Steven Gerrard.</p> <p>Match pointer Liverpool have never lost a Cup match to a team from the fourth tier, winning 10 and drawing twice</p> Arsenal v Hull City <p>Venue Emirates Stadium, Sunday 5.30pm</p> <p>Ref R Madley</p> <p>Odds Arsenal 1-3 Hull 9-1 Draw 9-2</p> <p>Memories will inevitably drift back to last season\xe2\x80\x99s Cup final, when Hull had one hand on the trophy at 2-0 up after eight minutes only for Arsenal to power back to win in extra time. Hull want a measure of revenge but Arsenal may come to view another Cup run as fundamental to their season.</p> <p>Match pointer Only George Ramsay (six with Aston Villa) has won the Cup as a manager more times than Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger</p>     Kieran Gibbs, right, consoles Jake Livermore after Arsenal came from behind to beat Hull City in the FA Cup final in May.

They are six points adrift at the bottom of the Championship and the Norwich loanee, Jacob Murphy, has departed in disgrace for mocking the team on Twitter. Villa, with several players out and one eye on top-flight survival, could be vulnerable.</p> <p>Match pointer Blackpool have not beaten a side from the top flight in the Cup since their 1-0 defeat of Burnley in 1976</p> Barnsley v Middlesbrough <p>Venue Oakwell, Saturday 3pm</p> <p>Ref D Whitestone</p> <p>Odds Barnsley 7-2 M\xe2\x80\x99brough 4-5 Draw 5-2</p> <p>Barnsley \xe2\x80\x93 who have not played since Boxing Day after their previous game against Oldham was postponed due to icy weather \xe2\x80\x93 will be without new signing George Williams, who is Cup-tied after playing for Worcester City in their run to the second round. Patrick Bamford may play for the visitors after extending his loan spell from Chelsea to the end of the season.</p> <p>Match pointer Middlesbrough have lost only two of their past 26 Cup games against sides from a lower division</p> Blyth Spartans v Birmingham City <p>Venue Croft Park, Saturday 3pm</p> <p>Ref M Jones</p> <p>Odds Blyth Spartans 10-1 B\xe2\x80\x99ham 3-10 Draw 5-1</p> <p>Five divisions may separate the sides but Blyth, in the bottom half of the Northern Premier League, are on a roll, having won their past seven games, including the second-round win at Hartlepool. Birmingham have picked up under Gary Rowett, who may rejig his side on Saturday and hand Nikola Zigic a start.</p> <p>Match pointer Birmingham have not lost to a non-league side in the Cup since Kidderminster beat them 2-1 in 1994</p> Bolton Wanderers v Wigan Athletic <p>Venue Macron Stadium, Saturday 3pm</p> <p>Ref P Dowd</p> <p>Odds Bolton 6-4 Wigan 2-1 Draw 12-5</p> <p>Bolton have comfortably the better form of the two Lancashire sides, though they will be without Lee Chung-yong on Saturday through injury. Wigan, marooned in the Championship\xe2\x80\x99s bottom three, are without Callum McManaman and Grant Holt but the 2013 winners will hope to draw on their fine recent Cup pedigree.</p> <p>Match pointer Excluding losses in penalty shootouts, Wigan are unbeaten in their past 13 Cup matches</p> Brentford v Brighton &amp; Hove A <p>Venue Griffin Park, Saturday 3pm</p> <p>Ref D Coote</p> <p>Odds Brentford 11-10 Brighton 5-2 Draw 12-5</p> <p>Chris Hughton\xe2\x80\x99s first game as Brighton manager takes him to the second tier\xe2\x80\x99s surprise high-fliers. Brentford are likely to reshuffle and the winger Sam Saunders could start. Brighton will also be much-changed, with the loanees Darren Bent, Greg Halford, Gary Gardner and Elliott Bennett all recalled.</p> <p>Match pointer There has been a goal between the 30th and 36th minute in each of Brighton\xe2\x80\x99s past six Cup games</p> Burnley v Tottenham Hotspur <p>Venue Turf Moor, Monday 7.45pm</p> <p>Ref R East</p> <p>Odds Burnley 3-1 Tottenham 8-11 Draw 3-1</p> <p>Burnley will be monitoring the fitness of their captain, Jason Shackell, who was substituted with a calf injury during their New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day draw at Newcastle. Dean Marney and Kevin Long may also miss out. Nabil Bentaleb will be unavailable for Tottenham as he joins Algeria for their Africa Cup of Nations campaign in Equatorial Guniea. Otherwise, Mauricio Pochettino has the same squad available that beat Chelsea 5-3 on Thursday.</p> <p>Match pointer Burnley have conceded 14 goals in their past four Cup matches and have gone 12 without a clean sheet</p>     Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s Nabil Bentaleb will not play at Burnley after joining Algeria national squad for the Africa Cup of Nations. Photograph: Ian Walton/Getty Images    Cambridge United v Luton Town <p>Venue Abbey Stadium, Saturday 3pm</p> <p>Ref T Harrington</p> <p>Odds Cambridge 7-4 Luton 7-4 Draw 12-5</p> <p>Cambridge, 14th in League Two, will look to beat a side 10 places above them for the first time in six meetings. They lost to Luton earlier this season, 1-0 at home in September. The visitors expect to be able to pick from a full strength squad, with Paul Benson, Luke Guttridge and Alex Lawless all available.</p> <p>Match pointer None of the past seven meetings between these sides in all competitons has ended in a home win</p> Charlton Athletic v Blackburn Rovers <p>Venue The Valley, Saturday 3pm</p> <p>Ref K Stroud</p> <p>Odds Charlton 12-5 Blackburn 7-5 Draw 12-5</p> <p>These clubs met at Ewood Park two weeks ago, with Charlton on the wrong end of a 2-0 scoreline. They have goalkeeper Neil Etheridge available after his loan deal was extended while Blackburn have Jason Steele available as his loan from Middlesbrough has been made permanent, but Ryan Tunnicliffe has returned to Fulham after a 17-game loan spell. Jack O\xe2\x80\x99Connell may make a second Rovers appearance after returning from a loan period at Rochdale.</p> <p>Match pointer There have been just eight goals scored in the past six Cup meetings between these sides</p> Chelsea v Watford <p>Venue Stamford Bridge, Sunday 4pm</p> <p>Ref K Friend</p> <p>Odds Chelsea 1-6 Watford 20-1 Draw 15-2</p> <p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho is expected to rest players following an arduous festive schedule and he will expect whoever comes in to produce a display that banishes memories of the 5-3 defeat by Tottenham on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day. Watford, for their part, have beaten Chelsea only once in 26 meetings in all competitions.</p> <p>Match pointer Chelsea have scored nine unanswered goals in their past two home meetings with Watford in the Cup</p>     Florent Malouda was among the goals the last time Chelsea played Watford back in 2010, resulting in a 5-0 scoreline.

Simon Dawkins, Craig Bryson and Omar Mascarell may also feature. Scott Kay returns after serving a three-game suspension for Southport, who are 20th in the Conference with 30 points from 26 games.</p> <p>Match pointer There have been four red cards in the five Cup matches involving Southport so far this season</p> Doncasters Rovers v Bristol City <p>Venue Keepmoat Stadium, Saturday 3pm</p> <p>Ref S Duncan</p> <p>Odds Doncaster 9-5 Bristol City 7-5 Draw 5-2</p> <p>Doncaster face the League One leaders on the back of three games unbeaten, and could play full-back Reece Wabara after he extended his short-term contract with Rovers to the end of the campaign. City beat their opponents 3-0 at Ashton Gate in the league on 13 September, and have asked Fulham for permission to field loanee Matt Smith, with fellow forwards Kieran Agard and Aaron Wilbraham injury doubts.</p> <p>Match pointer There have been four goals scored in the final five minutes of Doncaster\xe2\x80\x99s past three Cup matches</p> Dover Athletic v Crystal Palace <p>Venue Crabble Athletic Ground, Sunday 1pm</p> <p>Ref A Marriner</p> <p>Odds Dover 7-1 Crystal Palace 5-11 Draw 15-4</p> <p>Eighty-eight league places separate Dover \xe2\x80\x93 13th in the Conference \xe2\x80\x93 and top-flight Palace. The hosts are in excellent form, unbeaten in the league since a 1-0 defeat at Macclesfield in October. Alan Pardew could take charge of Palace for the first time when confirmed as Neil Warnock\xe2\x80\x99s successor. Palace will be without captain Mile Jedinak, who is with Australia at the Asian Cup.</p> <p>Match pointer Dover have played four times in the Cup already this season and have yet to concede a single goal</p> Everton v West Ham United <p>Venue Goodison Park, Tuesday 7.45pm</p> <p>Ref A Taylor</p> <p>Odds Everton 5-6 West Ham 3-1 Draw 13-5</p> <p>The Everton\xe2\x80\x99s winger Christian Atsu has joined the Ghana squad for the Africa Cup of Nations and Antol\xc3\xadn Alcaraz is also out, suspended after being sent off in the Premier League defeat by Hull City. Diafra Sakho and Cheikou Kouyat\xc3\xa9 are also Equatorial Guninea-bound, although Sam Allardyce says negotiations are ongoing between Cameroon and Alex Song.</p> <p>Match pointer Romelu Lukaku has scored in all of his three matches for Everton against West Ham in all competitions</p>     Romelu Lukaku has an excellent recent scoring record for Everton against West Ham United.

The Wolves manager, Kenny Jackett, has promised to play a strong team against Championship opposition, although Kevin McDonald is suspended and Kortney Hause is Cup-tied. The pair met at Craven Cottage in the league back on 20 August \xe2\x80\x93 Wolves won 1-0.</p> <p>Match pointer Wolves have not won away in the Cup in London since they beat Crystal Palace 1-0 in 1979</p> Huddersfield Town v Reading <p>Venue John Smith\xe2\x80\x99s Stadium, Saturday 3pm</p> <p>Ref P Gibbs</p> <p>Odds Huddersfield 7-5 Reading 2-1 Draw 13-5</p> <p>Grant Holt has gone back to Wigan after suffering a serious injury while on loan at Huddersfield. The manager, Chris Powell, will look to continue a good relationship with the Cup, having taken Charlton to the quarter-finals last year. The Reading captain, Jem Karacan, may return after a more than three months out with a knee problem.</p> <p>Match pointer Reading\xe2\x80\x99s past four win against Huddersfield in all competitions have all been by a 1-0 scoreline</p> Leicester City v Newcastle United <p>Venue King Power Stadium, Saturday 3pm</p> <p>Ref L Mason</p> <p>Odds Leicester 9-5 Newcastle 9-5 Draw 5-2</p> <p>Nigel Pearson was once No2 at Newcastle, even briefly serving as caretaker following Sam Allardyce\xe2\x80\x99s sacking, so the Leicester manager will know what John Carver is experiencing. Carver would relish succeeding Alan Pardew on a longer-term basis but his Newcastle squad are ravaged by injury and, as with Leicester, the Cup is not a priority. Could be a bit of a phoney war.</p> <p>Match pointer Newcastle have had a player sent off in three of their past four Cup matches away from home</p>     Nigel Pearson was Newcastle United\xe2\x80\x99s caretaker manager in 2008 \xe2\x80\x93 seen here marshalling his players at Old Trafford. Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters    Manchester City v Sheffield Wednesday <p>Venue Etihad Stadium, Sunday 3pm</p> <p>Ref M Oliver</p> <p>Odds Man City 1-6 Sheff Wed 22-1 Draw 7-1</p> <p>Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s press conferences often mention how Manchester City want to win every trophy and Sheffield Wednesday stand in the way as seek progress to the FA Cup fourth round. Little hope can be found for the Owls in the last time they faced City at the Etihad Stadium \xe2\x80\x93 that ended in a 7-0 drubbing in the League Cup.</p> <p>Match pointer Sheffield Wednesday have failed to win any of their past 15 Cup games against top flight sides</p> Millwall v Bradford City <p>Venue The Den, Saturday 3pm</p> <p>Ref D Webb</p> <p>Odds Millwall 11-10 Bradford 3-1 Draw 5-2</p> <p>The lower-placed side are arguably favourites in this meeting of Championship strugglers and League One promotion contenders. Bradford, whose striker James Hanson was a summer transfer target for Millwall, are unbeaten in nine games while Ian Holloway\xe2\x80\x99s team have lost three in a row.</p> <p>Match pointer Bradford have won their past nine penalty shootouts in the FA Cup and League Cup \xe2\x80\x93 an English record</p> Preston North End v Norwich City <p>Venue Deepdale, Saturday 3pm</p> <p>Ref S Attwell</p> <p>Odds Preston 12-5 Norwich 5-4 Draw 12-5</p> <p>Promotion is the priority for both these sides but one of the strongest teams in League One should pose a stern test for Norwich, who have moved into play-off contention in the Championship and have scored 14 goals in four games. Simon Grayson may give new signing Sylvan Ebanks-Blake his Preston debut.</p> <p>Match pointer There have been 20 goals scored in Norwich City\xe2\x80\x99s past four Cup matches away from home</p> Queens Park Rangers v Sheffield United <p>Venue Loftus Road, Sunday 1pm</p> <p>Ref M Clattenburg</p> <p>Odds QPR 3-4 Sheff Utd 9-2 Draw 3-1</p> <p>The last time QPR hosted a League One side in the Cup, in 2013, they were humiliated 4-2 by MK Dons. Harry Redknapp may rotate his side on Sunday and the Blades must make changes too, with defender Chris Basham suspended and loan striker Chris O\xe2\x80\x99Grady recalled by parent club Brighton.</p> <p>Match pointer Sheffield United have won their two previous Cup meetings with QPR \xe2\x80\x93 both times at Loftus Road</p> Rochdale v Nottingham Forest <p>Venue Spotland, Saturday 3pm</p> <p>Ref G Sutton</p> <p>Odds Rochdale 5-2 Nottm Forest 6-5 Draw 13-5</p> <p>Keith Hill has done a fine job in charge of Rochdale, twice getting them promoted and taking them into play-off contention this term. They should threaten an out-of-sorts Forest but will be without the midfielder Matty Lund and the on-loan defender Jack O\xe2\x80\x99Connell. Forest are missing the suspended Henri Lansbury.</p> <p>Match pointer There have been five 90th-minute goals scored in Nottingham Forest\xe2\x80\x99s past five Cup matches</p> Rotherham United v AFC Bournemouth <p>Venue New York Stadium, Saturday 3pm</p> <p>Ref N Swarbrick</p> <p>Odds R\xe2\x80\x99ham 3-1 B\xe2\x80\x99mouth 10-11 Draw 13-5</p> <p>The Rotherham manager Steve Evans described the FA Cup as a \xe2\x80\x9cwonderful distraction\xe2\x80\x9d this week despite facing an unglamorous yet daunting tie against the Championship leaders. Bournemouth must make a change in goal, however, with Lee Camp in for the loanee Artur Boruc, who is ineligible.</p> <p>Match pointer Bournemouth have managed to keep just one clean sheet in their past 13 Cup matches</p>     Bournemouth are one point clear at the top of the Championship under manager Eddie Howe. Photograph: Tom Jenkins    Southampton v Ipswich Town <p>Venue St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s Stadium, Sunday 3pm</p> <p>Ref M Atkinson</p> <p>Odds Southampton 4-9 Ipswich 8-1 Draw 19-5</p> <p>Mick McCarthy has guided Ipswich Town to second place in the Championship and will regard the trip to St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s as a chance to prove his side can cut it at the highest level. David McGoldrick, formerly of Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s academy, is their star man. Yet Southampton, unbeaten in four games, have regained their spark.</p> <p>Match pointer Ipswich have failed to win any of their six Cup matches since losing 2-1 at St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s in January 2010</p> Stoke City v Wrexham <p>Venue Britannia Stadium, Sunday 3pm</p> <p>Ref S Hooper</p> <p>Odds Stoke 1-6 Wrexham 22-1 Draw 8-1</p> <p>The 2011 finalists will have to do without Mame Diouf, who has gone with Senegal to the Africa Cup of Nations. They will have Peter Crouch available, after Mark Hughes rebuffed talk he might be sold this month. Wrexham have not played since Boxing Day after their home game with Forest Green Rovers was postponed due to a frozen pitch.</p> <p>Match pointer These sides have met 15 times before in all competitions with Wrexham winning only once</p> Sunderland v Leeds United <p>Venue Stadium of Light, Sunday 1pm</p> <p>Ref M Dean</p> <p>Odds Sunderland 4-7 Leeds 11-2 Draw 16-5</p> <p>Talk about an evocative tie. This one transports you straight back to Wembley in May 1973 and Ian Porterfield\xe2\x80\x99s winner for Bob Stokoe\xe2\x80\x99s Sunderland against then all-conquering Leeds as well as Jimmy Montgomery\xe2\x80\x99s double save. More than four decades on and United arrive as the Championship underdogs but will the Sunderland manager, Gus Poyet, once assistant to Dennis Wise at Elland Road, prioritise avoiding relegation over a Cup entanglement?</p> <p>Match pointer Leeds have won just one of their six Cup games since beating Manchester United in January 2010</p> Tranmere Rovers v Swansea City <p>Venue Prenton Park, Saturday 3pm</p> <p>Ref P Tierney</p> <p>Odds Tranmere 17-2 Swansea 2-5 Draw 4-1</p> <p>Tranmere have had a terrible couple of years, having been relegated last season and sucked in to a battle for league survival in this campaign. But they have lost only three times since Micky Adams took over in October and could spring a surprise against a Swansea side likely to include several fringe players.</p> <p>Match pointer The past five Cup games at Prenton Park have all been won by a one-goal margin (three wins for Rovers)</p> West Bromwich Albion v Gateshead <p>Venue The Hawthorns, Saturday 3pm</p> <p>Ref A Madley</p> <p>Odds West Brom 1-4 Gateshead 14-1 Draw 6-1</p> <p>Tony Pulis takes charge of Albion for the first time after being confirmed as Alan Irvine\xe2\x80\x99s replacement on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day. Youssouf Mulumbu will be unavailable as he joins the DR Congo squad for the Africa Cup of Nations. Gateshead \xe2\x80\x93 11th in the Conference \xe2\x80\x93 have played Albion twice, both in the FA Cup fourth round, in 1949 and 1952, and lost twice.</p>     Tony Pulis takes charge of his first game against Gateshead after watching West Brom\xe2\x80\x99s 1-1 draw with West Ham from the stands Photograph: Paul Harding/Action Images    <p>Match pointer Albion have not played a non-league side in the Cup since they lost 2-1 to Halifax in November 1993</p> Yeovil Town v Manchester United <p>Venue Huish Park, Sunday 3.30pm</p> <p>Ref C Pawson</p> <p>Odds Yeovil 14-1 Man Utd 1-4 Draw 6-1</p> <p>Yeovil have, perhaps unsurprisingly, never beaten Manchester United, losing both their previous meetings and conceding 11 times without reply in the process. They look ill-placed to improve on that record on Sunday as they are currently bottom of League One having scored just five times at home all season.</p> <p>Match pointer This match ends a run of nine consecutive Cup draws where United have faced another top-flight side</p>'
