b'From Sami Khedira to Dani Alves: 15 of the best players available on free transfers | Tor-Kristian Karlsen'


b'Sami Khedira <p>Age 28 Position Midfielder Club Real Madrid</p> <p>Arguably the most high-profile player whose contract is up this summer, Khedira has scarcely featured for the Spanish giants this season after it became clear that he would play the second part of 2015 elsewhere. Predominantly a defensive midfielder, the imposing German also participates constructively in the buildup phase. The World Cup winner from last summer has been strongly linked with Arsenal.</p> James Milner <p>Age 29 Position Midfielder Club Manchester City</p> <p>Perhaps surprisingly has being able to run down his contract at Manchester City, having been among the club\xe2\x80\x99s best players this season and establishing himself as something of a fans\xe2\x80\x99 favourite at Eastlands. Respected for his industry, versatility and professionalism, the England man will be an asset to whichever top club \xe2\x80\x93 Arsenal and Liverpool seem to be the front runners \xe2\x80\x93 ends up signing him.</p> Andr\xc3\xa9 Ayew <p>Age 25 Position Forward Club Marseille</p> <p>The son of the Marseille legend Abedi \xe2\x80\x9cPel\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x9d has enjoyed an impressive season in Ligue 1, finding the net 10 times and supplying six assists in his club\xe2\x80\x99s fight for a Champions League spot. The pacy left-footed winger or second striker is a self-declared Liverpool fan and has made it clear that a move to the Premier League is his No1 priority this summer.</p>     Marseille\xe2\x80\x99s Andr\xc3\xa9 Ayew in Ligue 1 action earlier this month. Photograph: Pascal Rossignol/Reuters    Sergio Romero <p>Age 28 Position Goalkeeper Club Sampdoria</p> <p>Curiously, the temperamental Argentina No1 has featured more for his country \xe2\x80\x93 including a World Cup final \xe2\x80\x93 than at club level over the past two seasons, yet Romero should have no problems finding a new employer this summer. An aggressive goalkeeper with excellent reflexes, he still needs to improve his footwork.</p> Dani Alves <p>Age 32 Position Right-back Club Barcelona</p> <p>Having failed to agree a new deal with the Catalans, the Brazilian with nearly 400 La Liga appearances to his name \xe2\x80\x93 and considered by many the best right-back over the past decade \xe2\x80\x93 is said to be attracting interest from Manchester United. Being somewhat past his prime, the full-back \xe2\x80\x93 whose defensive game was never a top priority \xe2\x80\x93 might also be a possible recruitment for an MLS side.</p> Andr\xc3\xa9-Pierre Gignac <p>Age 29</p> <p>Position Striker</p> <p>Club Marseille</p> <p>The Frenchman has been perennially watched by Premier League clubs without anyone being convinced enough to pay the required amount for the agile and opportunistic centre-forward. A no-brainer signing for Sam Allardyce during his Bolton days, the runner-up top scorer of Ligue 1 might finally secure a move to a mid- to lower-half Premier League side this summer.</p> Ignazio Abate <p>Age 28 Position Right-back Club Milan</p> <p>Though the Italy international is expected to sign a new deal with Milan, the negotiations appear to be moving along slowly because of the ownership question \xe2\x80\x93 let alone who will be the head coach next season \xe2\x80\x93 at the once successful club. The quick, hardworking right-back has been one of the few Milan players who can look back on the current season with any sense of pride.</p> Marcell Jansen <p>Age 29 Position Winger/full-back Club Hamburg</p> <p>As a part of cost-cutting measures at the relegation-threatened German club, the left-winger turned full-back is not going to be staying beyond this summer. Despite 45 caps for Germany, his injury record \xe2\x80\x93 he has picked up semi-serious muscle injuries during most recent seasons in his career \xe2\x80\x93 might deter some potential interested parties from offering a long-term contract.</p> Ron Vlaar <p>Age 30 Position Centre-half Club Aston Villa</p> <p>With most Premier League clubs desperate to bolster the heart of their defence, the Dutchman is likely to be picking and choosing from a fine variety of offers. Experienced, solid and a recognised leader, Vlaar could emerge as a safe acquisition for one of the top clubs \xe2\x80\x93 unless Tim Sherwood convinces him to sign a new deal.</p> Neto <p>Age 25 Position Goalkeeper Club Fiorentina</p> <p>Locked for months in unsuccessful contract negotiations with Fiorentina, the Brazilian seems set to capitalise on his Bosman status this summer. A flamboyant and slightly extrovert goalkeeper with impressive reflexes, he has inevitably been linked with Liverpool in the past, although Juventus are reported to be his most likely destination.</p> Nigel de Jong <p>Age 30 Position Midfielder Club Milan</p>     Nigel de Jong playing for Milan. Photograph: Antonio Calanni/AP    <p>Even though the combative Dutch midfielder has struggled in a disgracefully poor Milan side this season, it is worth remembering that De Jong \xe2\x80\x93 a Premier League champion with Manchester City in 2012 \xe2\x80\x93 still looked useful in last summer\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup and has found his previously worrying injury record improve significantly. With the juicy tackle still appreciated by many British managers, De Jong should have no problems finding another club in the Premier League.</p> Carlos Zambrano <p>Age 25 Position Centre-half Club Eintracht Frankfurt</p> <p>The no-nonsense Peruvian centre-back has resurrected a faltering Bundesliga career after initially being discarded by Schalke 04. His slightly on-the-edge playing style makes him prone to rough challenges and getting involved in the odd scrap. While a renewed deal with his current club is the most likely scenario, an impressive Copa Am\xc3\xa9rica campaign may earn him even more attractive options.</p> Danny Ings <p>Age 23 Position Striker Club Burnley</p>     Saying goodbye: Danny Ings. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images    <p>Despite enjoying a respectable campaign with Burnley, there\xe2\x80\x99s still some doubt as to whether Ings is ready to make the jump to a Champions League-level club or if he should be content for now with a move to a mid-table team. The busy, intense and hardworking forward in the British tradition could move abroad for nothing (though a switch to an English club would command a fee set by a tribunal), but his future is likely to be in the Premier League.</p> Michael Lang <p>Age 24 Position Right-back Club Grasshoppers</p> <p>A member of the Swiss World Cup squad last summer, the right-back \xe2\x80\x93 who can also deputise as a centre-back or defensive midfielder \xe2\x80\x93 is currently attracting interest from several Ligue 1 and Bundesliga clubs \xe2\x80\x93 though a full-back with good aerial ability might also come in handy for a newly-promoted Premier League side.</p> Stefan Strandberg <p>Age 24 Position Defender Club Rosenborg</p> <p>Another option for the budget-conscious, the Norwegian centre-back is determined to carry on his career abroad after previous prospective moves hit unexpected snags. Good on the ball, an intelligent reader of the game and calm in possession, the former Under-21 national team captain has also been capped three times at senior level.</p>'
