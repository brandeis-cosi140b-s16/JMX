b'Who should your club buy in the January transfer window?'


b'<p>The January transfer window is a little bit like New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve. You look forward to it with hope and trepidation, you spend a fair portion of the time checking your phone to see if anything more interesting is happening elsewhere and, by the time the countdown has been completed and your old acquaintances have been forgotten and replaced by new signings, you realise that not much has changed. </p> <p>Spending money in January rarely brings immediate success, but every fan knows their club is only a few signings away from where they want to be, so let\xe2\x80\x99s dream a little.</p> <p>As is customary at every transfer window, it\xe2\x80\x99s all about goals. Some clubs need to score more, other need to concede fewer, and most teams need to do both. Arsenal are in want of a defender, Sunderland could use a striker, and Burnley need both. Liverpool could do with a better goalkeeper, Everton should look to freshen things up and Queens Park Rangers are down to the bare bones. Who should your club buy in the window?</p>'
