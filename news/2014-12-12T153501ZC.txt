b'Chelsea v Hull City: match preview'


b'<p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho will see this as an opportunity to restore momentum after losing at Newcastle. Petr Cech will start given the muscular injury sustained by Thibaut Courtois, though that does not suggest weakness. Hull, with one win in 14 matches, arrive fragile if perhaps marginally encouraged by the points taken off Everton and West Brom in their past two fixtures. They have never won at Chelsea. Given they will begin the game below the relegation cut-off, this would be a timely occasion to make history.
