b'<p>Paul Pogba\xe2\x80\x99s agent says the France midfielder will leave Juventus this summer if the Italian champions receive \xe2\x80\x9cthe right offer\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Pogba, 22, is currently out of action with a hamstring injury and will miss the second leg of Juve\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League quarter-final against Monaco on Wednesday night.</p> <p>The former Manchester United player has been linked with a move to some of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s biggest clubs, with Juventus director Pavel Nedved admitting earlier this month that Barcelona are among those to have registered an interest.</p> <p>Now Pogba\xe2\x80\x99s agent, Mino Raiola, has acknowledged his client\xe2\x80\x99s time in Turin could be numbered despite signing a new five-year contract last October.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSince the beginning of the season, I received over 2000 phone calls about Pogba, about 20 a day,\xe2\x80\x9d he told La Stampa.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI received many engagement proposals, but none of them were worthy of marriage. We signed with Juventus for five more years, but we\xe2\x80\x99re all gentlemen: if the right offer arrives, we\xe2\x80\x99ll take it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid, Chelsea and Manchester City have also been linked with a move for Pogba, who left Old Trafford in 2012 on a free transfer. And Raiola believes his potential departure could have disastrous consequences for Juventus, who are on the verge of sealing a fourth successive Serie A title.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cJuventus will face a big challenge: they have to rebuild the team, they have to do that when they\xe2\x80\x99re on top, not when you\xe2\x80\x99e obliged to do that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNext year they\xe2\x80\x99d need four or five new players. Do you remember when they sold [Zinedine] Zidane?\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
