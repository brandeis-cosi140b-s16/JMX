b'Rio Ferdinand calls John Terry an \xe2\x80\x98idiot\xe2\x80\x99 over Anton Ferdinand race row'


b'<p>Rio Ferdinand has said John Terry acted like \xe2\x80\x9can idiot\xe2\x80\x9d over the incident three years ago in which the Chelsea captain was accused of racially abusing Ferdinand\xe2\x80\x99s brother, Anton. Writing in his forthcoming autobiography, the Queens Park Rangers defender expressed a deep sense of betrayal at the actions of his former England team-mate, claiming that his international career was wrecked in the aftermath of the incident.</p> <p>Following a five-day trial at Westminster magistrates\xe2\x80\x99 court in July 2012, Terry was absolved of racially abusing Anton Ferdinand in a heated exchange during a west London derby at Loftus Road the previous October. He had been accused of calling his opponent a \xe2\x80\x9cfucking black cunt\xe2\x80\x9d, a claim he denied, telling the court that he was simply repeating words he believed Anton Ferdinand had said to him as they argued.</p> <p>An FA hearing subsequently found Terry guilty of racial abuse, imposing a four-game ban and a \xc2\xa3220,000 fine on the Chelsea defender. Rio Ferdinand was omitted from Roy Hodgson\xe2\x80\x99s England squad for Euro 2012 amid fears that the inclusion of both players might have a divisive effect, although the manager claimed it was for football reasons. That effectively signalled the end of Ferdinand\xe2\x80\x99s international career, the player announcing his retirement the following May.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFor me the biggest idiot will always be John Terry,\xe2\x80\x9d claimed Ferdinand. \xe2\x80\x9cAs England captain and my centre-back partner he could have saved everyone a lot of pain by admitting immediately he used the word in the heat of the moment, but was no racist. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s probably what happened and what the truth is. Anton and I would\xe2\x80\x99ve accepted that \xe2\x80\x93 instead he never gave us a chance. That was the betrayal. He tried to run away from what he had done.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ferdinand\xe2\x80\x99s disappointment about being overlooked by Hodgson was exacerbated by what he saw as a failure by the England management to establish whether he would be willing to maintain a working relationship with Terry. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one ever asked,\xe2\x80\x9d added Ferdinand, who revealed that the pair became estranged and have not spoken since. \xe2\x80\x9cI find that pretty extraordinary because I\xe2\x80\x99d let it be known [that he would].\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The former Manchester United player also took aim at Ashley Cole, Terry\xe2\x80\x99s Chelsea team-mate at the time, for agreeing to give evidence for the defence at the court hearing. \xe2\x80\x9cAshley Cole had long been a friend of mine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ferdinand in an extract from his book #2sides. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve known each other since we were kids. But for me it ended the day he decided to go to court in support of John Terry. Anton rang me and my head nearly blew off. He was betraying Anton, who he\xe2\x80\x99d also known for years.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As Ferdinand makes clear, the fallout from the incident extended beyond the pitch, also affecting his wider family. \xe2\x80\x9cThere were bullets in the post,\xe2\x80\x9d added the QPR defender. \xe2\x80\x9cMy Mum had her windows smashed and bullets put through her door, and ended up in hospital because of the stress.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
