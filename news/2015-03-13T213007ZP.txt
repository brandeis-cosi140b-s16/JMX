b'Pochettino v Van Gaal: the man with a plan against the man without one? | David Hytner'


b'<p>As a boy in the Netherlands, Louis van Gaal was seduced by Tottenham Hotspur\xe2\x80\x99s white shirts, by the club\xe2\x80\x99s double-winning campaign of 1961 and by the twinkle-toed genius of Jimmy Greaves. \xe2\x80\x9cI was a fan of Tottenham during my childhood,\xe2\x80\x9d Van Gaal said. \xe2\x80\x9cJimmy Greaves was my idol. Those fantastic white shirts. And Jimmy Greaves \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The approach from Daniel Levy, the Tottenham chairman, came last December, after the sacking of Andr\xc3\xa9 Villas-Boas, and it was effectively to offer Van Gaal the manager\xe2\x80\x99s job at White Hart Lane. Van Gaal made it clear that anything would have to wait until the summer, because of his focus on the World Cup finals with Holland but he wanted to come to England and Tottenham ticked a lot of boxes.</p> <p>Then, in April Manchester United sacked David Moyes. At Tottenham, they had begun to fear that Van Gaal was holding out for a bigger Premier League club and they were prudent to broaden their search for a permanent successor to Tim Sherwood, the glorified interim. They settled on Mauricio Pochettino; Van Gaal would go to Old Trafford. \xe2\x80\x9cI came very close,\xe2\x80\x9d Van Gaal said of Tottenham. \xe2\x80\x9cVery close.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Where does Louis van Gaal stand in the Premier League tinker table? | Conrad Leach </p>   <p>It is difficult to find any Spurs supporter who is not grateful or a little bit relieved at how things worked out. Before the league fixture between the clubs at Old Trafford on Sunday, Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s travails are big box office, particularly in the wake of Monday night\xe2\x80\x99s tame FA Cup quarter-final exit at home to Arsenal and Pochettino has emerged as his antithesis; as an uncomfortable counterpoint.</p> <p>Both managers are fond of referring to their football \xe2\x80\x9cphilosophy\xe2\x80\x9d, which is a snazzy and more worldly take on the plain, old notion of style. It sounds deeper, more scholarly and profound. But Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy looks dynamic and consistent, with feelgood factors thrown in, none more so than his faith in homegrown, academy players.</p> <p>Tottenham had four of their own in the lineup for the Capital One Cup final against Chelsea, which they lost 2-0 \xe2\x80\x93 Harry Kane, Ryan Mason, Nabil Bentaleb and Andros Townsend \xe2\x80\x93 and another starter, Danny Rose, who is a product of the Leeds United academy, has been with them since he was 17.</p> <p>The fans identify with these players, especially Kane, and a bond has been built. \xe2\x80\x9cThe connection between the team and supporters is special,\xe2\x80\x9d Pochettino says. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the beginning of the season, it was different. Now it is fantastic.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy, by contrast, appears stodgy, confused and alienating. He did warn that it would take time to take hold. To paraphrase him, his approach is so idiosyncratic and the demands he places on players are so different it is only natural he tends to start slowly in new jobs. But, in mid-March, the process remains painfully slow, which is a neat way of summing up how his team have looked.</p> <p>Van Gaal continues to give the impression he does not know his best team or best system. According to Opta, Pochettino has started with a 4-2-3-1 formation in all but two of Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s 28 league games \xe2\x80\x93 he went with a classic 4-4-2 in the away wins over Aston Villa and Swansea City.</p> <p>The squad have become increasingly familiar with their roles and Pochettino has arrived at something approaching a regular lineup. Eight players have started in 21 or more league matches. Pochettino said, after last Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s win at Queens Park Rangers, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe most important thing I got from the team is they believe in our way.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>     Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino takes a photograph on his mobile phone after the game against QPR. Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images    <p>Van Gaal has flitted and is still flitting. He switched to 4-2-3-1 for the first time in the league for United\xe2\x80\x99s last two fixtures \xe2\x80\x93 the wins over Sunderland and Newcastle United but, generally, he has favoured 3-4-1-2 and 3-1-4-2 (six times apiece), and 4-4-2 with a midfield diamond (nine times). There has also been 4-1-4-1 (four times) and 4-3-3, once, in the home win over Hull City \xe2\x80\x93 a performance that Van Gaal rates as one of the best of the season.</p> <p>Three Premier League managers have played different starting formations more times \xe2\x80\x93 Harry Redknapp, who left QPR at the beginning of February; Steve Bruce (Hull City) and Nigel Pearson (Leicester City). But what is striking about Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s selections is that, in broad terms, he has given each system a run of consecutive games before moving on to the next one.</p> <p>Most of them have not been mere flashes in the pan but there is the sense that he has not been comfortable with any and does not trust the players to play the way he wants.</p> <p>In his own words, the 4-4-2 diamond formation gives him a \xe2\x80\x9ctwitchy ass\xe2\x80\x9d and he seems to feel more secure with three central defenders. But for this to flourish, they have to be comfortable on the ball and creative, and it is doubtful whether any of his centre-halves fit the description.</p> <p>Van Gaal has overseen progress of sorts. In the dog days of the Moyes era last March, the club lost 3-0 at home to both Liverpool and Manchester City. After the City defeat, they lagged 12 points off the Champions League pace.</p> <p>It is important to remember that Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s team sit fourth in the division. The record at Old Trafford is decent. Only three teams have scored more league goals and, thanks in part to their inspirational goalkeeper, David de Gea, only Chelsea and City conceded fewer.</p> <p>United were in a mess last summer, when Van Gaal started at Carrington on 16 July \xe2\x80\x93 eight days later his team were playing Los Angeles Galaxy in California. The churn of players in and out of the club was massive and the number of injuries over the season has not helped.</p> <p>Van Gaal has support behind the scenes and the little touches have gone a long way. For example, players have their lunch with people from other areas of the club, such as administrative staff, to get to know them and their roles.</p> <p>But what is bugging the fans is how un-United it all feels. To them, results are only part of the equation and slow, safe, sideways football \xe2\x80\x93 let alone lumping it long to the head or chest of Marouane Fellaini \xe2\x80\x93 is never going to sit well. Van Gaal has sought to nullify the lesser teams rather than simply going for it and his comment after the home win over Leicester City was jarring. \xe2\x80\x9cI want the players to play forward, without risky passes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> <p>Tottenham will travel to Old Trafford with the belief that their glass is half full. Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s season has not been without glitches and he spoke early on of a softness about the players\xe2\x80\x99 mentality \xe2\x80\x93 which echoed a complaint of several of his predecessors.</p> <p>But his methods have helped point the club in the right direction. The fitness regime he has overseen has led to remarkably few injuries and enabled the squad to cope with more official games than any other Premier League club.</p> <p>This is a young team that is growing and becoming harder. Pochettino has spent relatively little on transfers so there can be further satisfaction at how he has kept Tottenham on the fringes of the top four. Unlike Van Gaal, he is not expected to qualify for the Champions League, which might be of benefit.</p> <p>One of the principal rules of football journalism is that any article in which Tottenham are broadly talked up has to be the prompt for them to slump. United desperately need to rouse themselves.</p>'
