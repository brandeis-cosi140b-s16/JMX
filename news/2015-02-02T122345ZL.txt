b'<p>Leicester City, have signed the centre-back Robert Huth on loan from Stoke City until the end of the season. The 30-year-old German has become their third signing of the transfer window after the Croatian striker Andrej Kramaric for \xc2\xa39.7m and the goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer on a free from Chelsea.</p> <p>Huth will serve the second game of a two-match suspension after he admitted breaching Football Association rules in relation to social media comments when City host Crystal Palace on Saturday but will be available for selection when they travel to Arsenal on 10 February.</p> <p>He had apologised for interacting with a Twitter account that invited users of the social media site to guess from cropped photographs of people in explicit poses whether those pictured had male or female genitalia. In addition to the two-match ban, Huth was fined \xc2\xa315,000 and ordered to complete a mandatory education course.</p> <p>Huth, a Stoke player for more than five years, has made only one Premier League appearance since suffering a knee injury in November 2013.</p>'
