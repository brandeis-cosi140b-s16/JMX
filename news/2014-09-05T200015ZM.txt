b'Manchester City stalling over new contract for Joe Hart'


b'<p>Manchester City are keeping Joe Hart waiting regarding a new contract despite the champions recently extending the terms of Vincent Kompany, Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero, David Silva, Edin Dzeko, Samir Nasri and Aleksandar Kolarov on long-term deals.</p> <p>Hart, 28, is thought to be relaxed about the situation despite the England goalkeeper entering the final two years of his contract. While he has retained the No1 jersey this season, Manuel Pellegrini spent \xc2\xa36m on Willy Caballero in the summer to provide direct competition for Hart.</p> <p>City suffered a shock 1-0 defeat by Stoke City at the Etihad Stadium in their last match before the international break, with Hart letting Miame Diouf\xe2\x80\x99s 58th-minute winner through his legs, though the keeper was not helped by team-mates who allowed the striker to make a 50-yard solo run before the finish.</p> <p>The error, which recalled Hart\xe2\x80\x99s problems in the opening half of last season, may cause Pellegrini to consider his position and whether to field Caballero as City next face Arsenal, Bayern Munich and Chelsea.</p> <p>Last season Pellegrini dropped Hart following a series of mistakes that culminated in allowing Fernando Torres to score a late winner for Chelsea.</p> <p>Costel Pantilimon took his place and the Romanian was given a run in the side until the 4-2 win at Fulham on 21 December when Hart returned.</p> <p>Hart subsequently had a virtually faultless second part of the season, drawing praise from Pellegrini for his form and the strong character displayed to bounce back from being discarded.</p>'
