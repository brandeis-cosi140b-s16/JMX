b'Manchester United on alert over future of Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s Lionel Messi'


b'<p>Lionel Messi has alerted Manchester United to his potential availability by casting doubt over his future at Barcelona, with the Argentina forward admitting he does not know where he will be playing next year.</p> <p>United are the only English club that could afford to buy Messi, particularly if Barcelona were to demand his \xe2\x82\xac250m (\xc2\xa3195m) buyout fee in one payment, which would be likely.</p> <p>Although Manchester City have explored bringing the 27-year-old from Barcelona and retain an interest in him, Uefa\xe2\x80\x99s financial fair play rules mean the champions would struggle to generate enough revenue and have the requisite cash reserves to buy the four-times world player of the year.</p> <p>This is not the case at United, where Louis van Gaal has been assured there is no limit on the transfer budget. Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, stated in July: \xe2\x80\x9cWhether it\xe2\x80\x99s a [world] record or not doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really resonate with us. What resonates is an elite player that the manager wants who is going to be a star for Manchester United.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Alongside the buyout clause is Messi\xe2\x80\x99s five-year contract, agreed last May, worth \xc2\xa316.3m a season. When this salary is factored in, the total cost of any deal for his transfer would be in the region of an eye-watering \xc2\xa3275m.</p> <p>Real Madrid are the only club who appear able to rival United\xe2\x80\x99s financial muscle \xe2\x80\x93 Paris Saint-Germain would also have the restrictions of FFP to consider \xe2\x80\x93 but it seems inconceivable Messi would end up at Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s fiercest rival.</p>           Messi hits back at rumours about Luis Enrique tensions    <p>Messi was asked in Zurich before the Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or ceremony, at which he finished second to Cristiano Ronaldo, whether he would be interested in playing at another club, having also turned out, as a youth, for Newell\xe2\x80\x99s Old Boys in Argentina. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure If I will go back to Newell\xe2\x80\x99s Old Boys one day,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not sure where I will be next year. I have always said that I will end my career at Barcelona but as Cristiano said: \xe2\x80\x98Only God knows the future.\xe2\x80\x99 Things in football can change overnight.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>United\xe2\x80\x99s record \xc2\xa3750m, 10-year kit deal with Adidas starts next season, meaning the club can expect \xc2\xa375m a season from that contract alone. With Woodward continuing to expand the club\xe2\x80\x99s portfolio of major sponsors and the fanbase claimed at 659 million around the world, United would be confident that Messi\xe2\x80\x99s signing would be financially successful.</p> <p>Messi\xe2\x80\x99s comment came hours after he said it was \xe2\x80\x9clies\xe2\x80\x9d that there had been conversations between his representatives and City and Chelsea. Speaking after a 3-1 win over Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid, in which he scored the final goal, Messi told Bar\xc3\xa7a TV: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t demand anything for me to stay because I have no intention of leaving anywhere. I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard stories I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken to Chelsea or City, that\xe2\x80\x99s all lies.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Lionel Messi helps Barcelona unite to avert a crisis \xe2\x80\xa6 for now | Sid Lowe </p>   <p>The comments came in an attempt to quell speculation of a rift with Luis Enrique, the manager, following a turbulent week in which Messi was on the bench as Bar\xc3\xa7a lost to Real Sociedad and during which Andoni Zubizarreta, the sporting director, was sacked.</p> <p>Van Gaal was expected to have held talks with Radamel Falcao on Monday after he dropped the striker from United\xe2\x80\x99s 1-0 defeat to Southampton at Old Trafford.</p> <p>The Colombian was informed he was not in the matchday squad just before the kick-off, Van Gaal deciding he wanted only one striker on the bench and that this should be 19-year-old James Wilson, owing to his pace.</p> <p>The future of Falcao, who is on a season-long loan at a total cost of \xc2\xa316m, is in the balance. A move to sign the striker on a permanent contract from Monaco would cost around \xc2\xa343m.</p> <p>Falcao may have a route back into the squad if Robin van Persie\xe2\x80\x99s ankle problem proves serious enough to rule him out of United\xe2\x80\x99s trip to play Queens Park Rangers on Saturday.</p>'
