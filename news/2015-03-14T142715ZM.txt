b'<p>Who needs Jordan Rhodes anyway? That was the question Patrick Bamford emphatically posed as his second-half brace enhanced Middlesbrough\xe2\x80\x99s prospects of reaching the Premier League and all but eliminated Ipswich Town from the\xc2\xa0Championship\xe2\x80\x99s automatic promotion race.</p> <p>Middlesbrough were hoping to take Blackburn Rovers striker Rhodes \xe2\x80\x93 nephew of their assistant manager, Steve Agnew \xe2\x80\x93 on loan for the rest of the season, with a view to a \xc2\xa39m permanent switch should they go up. Last August, Rhodes was the subject of two similar-size bids from Hull City, where Agnew worked previously. However, this latest bid, like those before it, appears to have been rebuffed.</p> <p>So the changes Aitor Karanka, the Middlesbrough manager, made were positional rather than additional, switching personnel and altering his team\xe2\x80\x99s shape to 4-4-2 as they entered the final 10 matches of a pulsating campaign. The moving of Bamford from the right of a supporting three to a central area proved pivotal to the north-east club\xe2\x80\x99s most resounding win for three months.</p> <p>Only half a dozen times in their previous 13 league matches had Middlesbrough scored more than once, but Bamford \xe2\x80\x93 in partnership with Dutchman Jelle Vossen \xe2\x80\x93 provided a more clinical edge to their attack .</p> <p>Twice during the opening period his pace resulted in penalty appeals: the first, with Luke Chambers in attendance, resulted in the corner from which Middlesbrough went in front and the second \xe2\x80\x93 just before half-time \xe2\x80\x93 a seemingly clear-cut one, not given, that incensed the home crowd and allowed Christophe Berra a sigh of relief.</p> <p>However, there was no catching the on-loan Chelsea striker when, anticipating Vossen\xe2\x80\x99s instinctive 64th-minute flick on the halfway line, he outstripped his pursuers and kept his composure to round substitute keeper Bartosz Bialkowski and roll in Boro\xe2\x80\x99s third goal. A quarter of an hour later, Bamford struck his 15th goal of the season to punish Ipswich\xe2\x80\x99s ragged defence with a low left-footed drive on the run that beat Bialkowski all too comfortably.</p> <p>Bamford squandered the chance to keep the match ball four minutes from time, when Albert Adomah\xe2\x80\x99s adept lay-off during another typically incisive home counter-attack was met with a wild finish. However, Karanka, who refused to discuss the Rhodes situation, was pleased enough: \xe2\x80\x9cPatrick is the kind of player who needs to score goals to be confident. I am not concerned with my strikers because I have the best strikers in the league.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Middlesbrough, who began the day as one of four teams separated only by goal difference at the summit of the Championship, went in front inside the opening four minutes. The returning Daniel Ayala was first to Adam Clayton\xe2\x80\x99s clip into the area from a short corner routine, his forehead deflecting the ball beyond Ipswich goalkeeper Dean Gerken, who was flattened a split second later by his own defender Berra, and later went to hospital for a scan.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s never nice to see one of your players taken off with an oxygen mask attached,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Ipswich manager, Mick McCarthy, whose side equalised immediately after the six-minute delay for Gerken\xe2\x80\x99s medical treatment.</p> <p>Middlesbrough goalkeeper Dimi Konstantopoulos inexplicably patted Jonathan Parr\xe2\x80\x99s speculative effort back into play, rather than around a post, and the Championship\xe2\x80\x99s top scorer, Daryl Murphy, displayed his predatory instincts to pounced for the 23rd time this season a day shy of his 32nd birthday. At that stage, Ipswich\xe2\x80\x99s own automatic promotion hopes remained alive, and Murphy struck the base of the post with a twice-deflected shot midway through the half.</p> <p>But Middlesbrough took the lead, and a psychological advantage in the pursuit of a top-two finish, from a second short corner routine on the half-hour: a blocked Grant Leadbitter shot fell to Adomah, whose fifth goal of the season, took a nick on its way through. With Derby and Bournemouth their next opponents, Bamford and Boro appear to have rediscovered their shooting boots at exactly the right time.</p>     Middlesbrough\xe2\x80\x99s Albert Adomah celebrates with Patrick Bamford after making it 2-1 against Ipswich.
