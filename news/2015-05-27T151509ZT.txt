b'The Fiver | Nothing to see here'


b'<p>FIF \xe2\x80\xa6 AH</p> <p>As you\xe2\x80\x99ll probably know, it all kicked off at Fifa on Wednesday morning. Nine of the governing body\xe2\x80\x99s assorted wonks have been indicted by the frankly terrifying-sounding USA! USA!! USA!!! Department of Justice, on charges including but not limited to \xe2\x80\x9cracketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies\xe2\x80\x9d. The lucky chaps are: Jeffrey Webb, Eugenio Figueredo, Eduardo Li, Julio Rocha, Costas Takkas, Rafael Esquivel, Jos\xc3\xa9 Maria Marin, Nicol\xc3\xa1s Leoz and, of course, our old friend Jack Warner.</p> <p>In addition, the Swiss authorities will be conducting their own investigation, during which they will have a word on the QT with 10 members of the Fifa ExCo who took part in that lovely old World Cup vote back in 2010. Those are: Issa Hayatou (Cameroon), Vitaly Mutko (Russia), Angel Mar\xc3\xada Villar Llona (Spain), Michel D\xe2\x80\x99Hooghe (Belgium), Senes Erzik (Turkey), Worawi Makudi (Thailand), Marios Lefkaritis (Cyprus), Jacques Anouma (Ivory Coast), Rafael Salguero (Guatemala) and Hany Abo Rida (Egypt). The Swiss attorney general says they\xe2\x80\x99ll be asked about \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal mismanagement and money laundering\xe2\x80\x9d, having seized assorted electronic data and documents from Fifa HQ.</p> <p>So, all in all, quite a day, and quite a collection of dignitaries. And a day you would think is, to say the least, not ideal for Fifa given that the coronatio \xe2\x80\xa6 sorry, election of Sepp Blatter as top dog, major domo and El Presidente is due to take place on Friday. Not a bit of it, mind, according to Fifa human shield Walter de Gregorio, who stepped up to face the world\xe2\x80\x99s press as their collective jaw swung on its hinges: \xe2\x80\x9cThis for Fifa is good. It is not good in terms of image or reputation, but in terms of cleaning up, this is good \xe2\x80\xa6 It is not a nice day, but it is also a good day.\xe2\x80\x9d And on Sepp\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind, for that is what we were all wondering about, De Gregorio repeatedly made clear that has boss had absolutely nothing to do with the officials he oversaw as president being arrested, and that he was \xe2\x80\x9crelaxed\xe2\x80\x9d but not \xe2\x80\x9cdancing in his office\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>He wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only one declaring that there was nothing to see here. Warner released a statement saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI have fought fearlessly against all forms of injustice and corruption. I have been afforded no due process and I have not even been questioned in this matter. I reiterate that I am innocent of any charges. I have walked away from the politics of world football to immerse myself in the improvement of lives in this country where I shall, God willing, die.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s also worth noting what a few of those who are to be asked for their views on all of this had to say before about such allegations:</p>  <li>Leoz, in 2013: \xe2\x80\x9cA while ago the press in England were at it, now the German press do it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. What is it that drives these people?\xe2\x80\x9d</li>   <li>Mutko, who in 2010 attacked the British press for \xe2\x80\x9cportraying Russia as a hotbed of corruption\xe2\x80\x9d, said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re prepared to show everything. We\xe2\x80\x99ve always acted within the law.\xe2\x80\x9d</li>   <li>And in January, Webb said: \xe2\x80\x9cI believe that the tremendous work that our integrity committee did in bringing a level of transparency to our confederation \xe2\x80\xa6 we will have implemented every single one of their recommendations for transparency in governance.\xe2\x80\x9d</li>  <p>Five days on from Sepp declaring that \xe2\x80\x9cthe next two months will showcase some of our key events\xe2\x80\x9d, the investigation continues.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t really admit it \xe2\x80\x93 I decided to write it as a novel \xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I have any real quotes from him. I tried to get an illusion of him, to try and find the story. I tried to find the literary Ibrahimovic \xe2\x80\xa6 The first thing he said was: \xe2\x80\x98What the [eff] is this? I never said this!\xe2\x80\x99 But after a while I think he understood what I was trying to do. Nowadays he thinks it\xe2\x80\x99s really his story\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Zlatan Ibrahimovic\xe2\x80\x99s ghostwriter David Lagercrantz admits that those quotes you liked from \xe2\x80\x98I Am Zlatan\xe2\x80\x99 were made up by him.</p>     \xe2\x80\x98You want answers?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98I want the truth!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98You can\xe2\x80\x99t handle the truth!\xe2\x80\x99 Photograph: Loic Venance/AFP/Getty Images    GET YOUR VASE ON <p>When The Fiver wakes up every morning, it is faced with choices. Stay in bed till 2pm, drinking tins and eating the two-day old bacon and egg sandwich that it found stuffed between the wall and mattress, or get up. Wallow in its natural aroma \xe2\x80\x93 a smell that whiffs like a cross between a turd covered in burnt hair and the time the raccoon got in the copier \xe2\x80\x93 or wash. Stay on the couch with the curtains closed, shoving great big spoons of butter into its mouth while watching another episode of Kirstie Allsopp\xe2\x80\x99s Home Style, or go outside and into the sunshine. Needless to say that butter tasted almost as good as the sandwich and The Fiver is used to that smell by now, even if the neighbours aren\xe2\x80\x99t.</p> <p>But The Fiver is not the only entity with choices to make these days. Football clubs do too. They can choose to have a crack at winning a trophy and writing their names in the history books. They can choose to try and give their fans something to remember for the rest of their lives. They can choose to chase glory and success, the whole point of competitive, top-level sport. Or, they can choose to dodge the glory and the success and instead opt to rest their players\xe2\x80\x99 tired, little legs in the hope that the poor lambs can muster a few more piddling points that get the club a slightly higher place in the league and thus more cash money. Modern football clubs, eh? Yeah, with a capital C.</p> <p>But come here, not every side club can be smeared by The Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s one-coloured paintbrush. Take tonight\xe2\x80\x99s Big Vase finalists, Sevilla and Dnipro, for example. The Spaniards clearly care about the glory as they are aiming for a record fourth title, while the Ukrainians have fought their way to the final despite having to face some of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s biggest clubs, play 18 games and all of their home matches in front of stands \xe2\x80\x93 often empty \xe2\x80\x93 400 miles away across the war-torn region in Kiev. Makes all those other complaints about too many games and tiredness look weaker than seven days, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it?</p> <p>And what\xe2\x80\x99s more, both sides are more excited about it than a kid tasting popping candy for the first time. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are emotional, we are excited because this is a first final for Dnipro,\xe2\x80\x9d cheered captain Ruslan Rotan. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will try to get hold of ourselves as soon as the whistle blows as we will have to concentrate. However, we are hungry for it so we will do everything we can to win.\xe2\x80\x9d Sevilla\xe2\x80\x99s Jos\xc3\xa9 Antonio Reyes was equally starry-eyed when quizzed about winning: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is history and for Sevilla it would be a fourth title, which would be a record. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great goal for us, so we are hopeful that we will be lucky, make our supporters happy and make history.\xe2\x80\x9d It is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities, sniffed someone somewhere sometime ago. Some clubs would do well to remember that, as would The Fiver in fairness.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Paul Doyle from 7.45pm BST for MBM coverage of Dnipro 1-3 Sevilla in Big Vase final.</p> RECOMMENDED VIEWING <p>What do you mean you already know everything there is to know about Dnipro? Liar. Allow Jonathan Wilson and Andy Brassell to fill in the gaps about the Big Vase finalists.</p>            FIVER LETTERS <p>[Snip \xe2\x80\x93 Fiver Lawyers].</p> <p>[Snip \xe2\x80\x93 Fiver Lawyers].</p> <p>[Snip-snippety-snip \xe2\x80\x93 Fiver Lawyers].</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSo Xavi is leaving Barcelona at the end of the season, a one-club man who was born and raised in the local area, captained the club to European glory and seemed to be the embodiment of the club on the pitch and that\xe2\x80\x99s it, he just effs off? No six-month farewell tour? No get-Xavi-to-Berlin campaign? No mawkish final game at Camp Nou where a guard of honour greats him and his children while various Bar\xc3\xa7a legends sit in the stands holding back the tears? I suppose he\xe2\x80\x99ll just have to make do with polishing his umpteen league winners medals\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Adrian Foster.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted rid of Big Sam (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver) when he was at Blackeye Rovers. Despite a top-10 finish and Milk Cup semi-final, I knew we would likely struggle without him and suspected we may well end up in a relegation dogfight, but just did not care. He manages teams the same way I manage my diet: Monday to Thursday dull \xe2\x80\x98heart healthy\xe2\x80\x99 type things, like chicken breast (no skin) boiled potatoes, broccoli and peas; I go through the motions because on Friday I want a vindaloo and naan bread takeaway, Saturday to eat out and Sunday, well, the Sunday roast (still with broccoli and peas, but wearing a gravy overcoat). Allardyce sets his seasons out like that: away at Manchester United, chicken and broccoli, home to West Brom, steak and chips. And that\xe2\x80\x99s fine when it\xe2\x80\x99s me trying to keep my weight the right side of 17 stone, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not OK when you mess with people\xe2\x80\x99s delusions and set out realistic expectations. I know we will likely lose away to United, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t ever want to believe we will lose, not secretively, not really. Every time I watch my team I want all the excitement of a Friday night curry, even though I know it will likely be chicken and broccoli. Allardyce strips you of that hope. He fights the fights he can win, he makes a realist of you and that\xe2\x80\x99s not on. Football\xe2\x80\x99s the fancy trifle, not the stick of celery. Bah, I\xe2\x80\x99m all hungry now\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Marten Allen.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cCan I be the first person to make a prediction for the new footballing season ahead? Think of all the assistant managers of our time, freeloading on the back of the success of the manager who employed them \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking Sammy Lee, Brian Kidd, Alan Irvine, etc. Now, what happened when they stepped up to become a No1? Exactly. So Derby County fans should look away now \xe2\x80\x93 Paul Clement of Real Madrid, prove me wrong, sir\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Marc Meldrum.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
