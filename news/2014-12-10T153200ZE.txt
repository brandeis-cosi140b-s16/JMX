b'<p>Mauricio Pochettino had no hesitation in granting Emmanuel Adebayor\xe2\x80\x99s request to return home to deal with a family matter.</p> <p>As Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s squad made their way to Turkey for Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s Europa League match with Besiktas, Spurs announced the striker would be absent because of a \xe2\x80\x9cprivate matter\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Adebayor returned to Togo for what the club called \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal reasons\xe2\x80\x9d, with reports suggesting a close relative of the striker had fallen ill.</p> <p>Pochettino confirmed on arriving at the Ataturk Olimpiyat Stadium it was a family-related matter and that Adebayor had requested permission to return home.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have a problem, your mind is not quite \xe2\x80\xa6 it is difficult to give your best,\xe2\x80\x9d the manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have always told you that players are human. Many problems happen and it is important to fix this type of problem because always family is important.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut we hope when he comes back he will be ready to start training and to help the team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>       <p>Adebayor has not played for Spurs since the 2-1 defeat at home to Stoke on 9 November, having been laid low by back and hamstring complaints as well as a virus.</p> <p>He has struggled for form since Pochettino\xe2\x80\x99s arrival at White Hart Lane, scoring twice in 12 appearances.</p> <p>While the 30-year-old misses the trip to Turkey, there could be a return to action for Kyle Walker.</p>       <p>The right-back has not featured for Spurs since the first leg of the Europa League last-16 meeting with Benfica in March because of an abdominal problem that led to him missing out on England\xe2\x80\x99s World Cup squad and undergo surgery in September.</p> <p>Walker returned to training a month ago and could now make his first appearance in nine months against Besiktas.</p> <p>Pochettino said he would decide after training there whether to start Walker or put him on the bench.</p> <p>Besiktas will be without their former Chelsea striker Demba Ba, who has a broken toe. His fellow attacker Mustafa Pektemek is also absent for Slaven Bilic\xe2\x80\x99s side.</p> <p>Besiktas\xe2\x80\x99 progression to the knockout stages has already been secured but they will be going in search of the win.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got a good form, we have got good results,\xe2\x80\x9d the former West Ham and Everton defender Bilic said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe have before us a great team and a tough test awaits. There are a number of our players missing and we have to be careful about injuries and fatigue.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
