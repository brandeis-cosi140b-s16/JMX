b'Alan Pardew banks on payback from Moussa Sissoko against Chelsea'


b'<p>Alan Pardew said Moussa Sissoko owes Newcastle United a good game at home to Chelsea on Saturday after serving a silly suspension but is expecting to fend off bids for the France midfielder when the transfer window opens next month.</p> <p>Sent off for collecting a thoroughly unnecessary second yellow card \xe2\x80\x93 just moments after his first for kicking the ball away \xe2\x80\x93 at West Ham last Saturday, Sissoko missed Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s 1-1 draw with Burnley at Turf Moor and Pardew is relieved to have arguably his best player back for the visit of Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s team.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think Moussa does owe the team a little bit if I\xe2\x80\x99m honest,\xe2\x80\x9d Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s manager said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat sending off was needless and he would possibly be the first to admit it. On the other hand, if there\xe2\x80\x99s one player Chelsea will have a close eye on it is Moussa \xe2\x80\x93 and I know how thorough Mourinho is with his preparations. Moussa\xe2\x80\x99s been absolutely superb for us this season \xe2\x80\x93 and I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for a big game from him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>An amalgam of formidable power, pace and technical precision, Sissoko has thrived since been shifted to a more central, slightly deeper role. Still extremely dangerous offensively but also adept at disrupting opponents\xe2\x80\x99 play, he is seen as Newcastle\xe2\x80\x99s answer to Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9.</p> <p>The comparisons have heightened interest in the former Toulouse midfielder from clubs involved in the Champions League, with both Mourinho and Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger known admirers of his talent.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve not had contact from anybody else or heard from anybody else,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pardew, who would resist any attempt to prise a prize asset away from St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park. \xe2\x80\x9cMoussa is playing for a club where big clubs have come before and taken players away. I understand that so therefore I guess he\xe2\x80\x99s a player they\xe2\x80\x99ll be looking at. That\xe2\x80\x99s all I can say because he\xe2\x80\x99s been terrific for us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>There is a caveat. Sissoko suffered a prolonged dip in form earlier this year. Until this autumn\xe2\x80\x99s renaissance, memories of his stunning home debut against Chelsea in February 2013, when he scored twice in a 3-2 Newcastle victory, were fading fast.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong, Moussa had a great day back then but he\xe2\x80\x99s a better player now,\xe2\x80\x9d Pardew said. \xe2\x80\x9cPart of his problem after that was, because the team dipped, they took him with them. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t put everything at his door though. He\xe2\x80\x99s only a young player, only 25 and he already has 27 caps for France. This is a guy who could win 50, 60, 70 international caps. He\xe2\x80\x99s always been powerful but he\xe2\x80\x99s a better player than he was in that game against Chelsea nearly two years ago. Moussa now has more experience and a better knowledge of the Premier League. And without a doubt he\xe2\x80\x99s improved technically.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Pardew had hoped the technically accomplished Davide Santon would have a similarly influential impact his season but instead the Italy left-back \xe2\x80\x93 a particular favourite of Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s during their Internazionale days \xe2\x80\x93 is sidelined following another operation on his troublesome right knee last May. Yet if Santon has almost become a forgotten man on Tyneside, his offensive qualities are missed at St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cDavide hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been forgotten by us,\xe2\x80\x9d Pardew said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know we have an outstanding talent there. He\xe2\x80\x99s on the way back and has made some big strides this week. By the start of January I expect to see Davide in and around the team.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the surgeon went in to his knee it was a little bit worse than we expected. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it was career-threatening but the rehab was always going to take a bit longer than we thought.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
