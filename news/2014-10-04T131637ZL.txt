b'Leeds United v Sheffield Wednesday: Championship \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>So, after all that, it\xe2\x80\x99s a point each, and little really changes for either team. Leeds move up to 11th, Wednesday stay 9th. The hosts dominated much of the first half, and Antenucci forced Westwood into three fine saves at the start of the second. Unfortunately, during that flurry, Wednesday broke at the other end and took the lead. Leeds reeled and the game dissolved into a series of skirmishes, until Giuseppe Bellusci showed rare composure to snatch a point. You might argue neither team really did enough to win \xe2\x80\x93 and you\xe2\x80\x99d be right. That\xe2\x80\x99s all from me. Thanks for reading. Bye.</p>'
