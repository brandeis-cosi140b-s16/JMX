b'Stoke City v Chelsea: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened!'


b'<p>An impressive show of strength from Chelsea. They restore their three-point lead over Manchester City thanks to goals in each half from John Terry and Cesc Fabregas. They were rarely under threat; Jose Mourinho will be delighted with the way his side dealt with Stoke, although there may be some concern about Eden Hazard limping off near the end. John Terry walks down the tunnel beating his chest as the Chelsea fans salute him. Next up for Chelsea: the visit of fourth-placed West Ham on Boxing Day. Thanks for reading. Bye.</p>'
