b'<p>Kelvin Davis has waited 14 months since his last Southampton appearance, but called upon as an early replacement for the injured Fraser Forster \xe2\x80\x93 who will now almost certainly be forced to withdraw from Roy Hodgson\xe2\x80\x99s England squad \xe2\x80\x93 the 38-year-old made a contribution that could yet prove significant to the outcome of his side\xe2\x80\x99s season.</p> <p>Forster was carried off with his left knee in a splint after slipping awkwardly making a routine, 10th-minute clearance under pressure from Sam Vokes. The keeper has been outstanding this season and his departure was clearly a setback for a Southampton side anxious to register only their second win in six games and revive their fading hopes of forcing their way into the top four.</p> <p>Davis, though, proved a more than capable replacement, apparently unaffected by his lack of match action and producing a number of fine saves \xe2\x80\x93 full-length stops from Vokes and Danny Ings were particularly eye-catching \xe2\x80\x93 to deflate Burnley and lay the foundation for a victory secured through Shane Long\xe2\x80\x99s first-half effort and Jason Shackell\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate 58th-minute own-goal.</p> <p>While Sean Dyche, the Burnley manager, was convinced his side should have had a first-half penalty, Southampton ended the game comfortably in control.</p> <p>Anything less than victory would have been an enormous blow to Ronald Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s side. Instead, they will look forward to their remaining games with renewed confidence, with Davis expected to play a prominent role after the manager confirmed the news on Forster was not good. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s in hospital,\xe2\x80\x9d said Koeman. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not looking positive for his knee. The doctor wasn\xe2\x80\x99t positive. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99ll be available for England.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The win moved Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s side to within three points of Manchester United, who lie fourth before their meeting with Liverpool. Koeman has maintained his belief that his side can sustain their challenge for a place in next season\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League, setting his side the target of five wins in their final nine fixtures before this game.</p> <p>Last Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s draw at Chelsea suggested the manager\xe2\x80\x99s confidence had transmitted itself to his players and this was by no means a straightforward win against a side given fresh hope of avoiding relegation by their impressive victory over Manchester City seven days previously.</p> <p>Had Dyche\xe2\x80\x99s side managed to find a way past Davis when they enjoyed a period of first-half control, the visitors may have been able to add to those unexpected three points . As it was, they offered enough signs to suggest they will enjoy more productive days between now and the end of the campaign.</p> <p>Both managers were in agreement about Davis\xe2\x80\x99s contribution. \xe2\x80\x9cKelvin was fantastic,\xe2\x80\x9d said Koeman. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a long time ago that he last played, so that\xe2\x80\x99s difficult. But he\xe2\x80\x99s experienced, he\xe2\x80\x99s not nervous to come in and that\xe2\x80\x99s important for the defenders.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Dyche, though, believed his side were guilty of failing to make more of their chances and expressed his frustration at the referee Roger East\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to award a penalty when Jos\xc3\xa9 Fonte appeared to trip George Boyd. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was very surprising we didn\xe2\x80\x99t get a penalty and that was the third in a couple of weeks,\xe2\x80\x9d added Dyche. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell my players not to simulate but maybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to change\xe2\x80\x93 I must be the greenest manager in the world looking at that. But we had three key chances and didn\xe2\x80\x99t take them. I was disappointed in the finishing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The visitors found themselves behind in the 37th minute. Dyche\xe2\x80\x99s side had only themselves to blame for failing to clear a weak header from Sadio Man\xc3\xa9, but they were entitled to feel hard done to when Nathaniel Clyne\xe2\x80\x99s shot found its way to Long via a defender\xe2\x80\x99s boot and a Graziano Pell\xc3\xa8 miskick. Long took full advantage, finishing from close range.</p> <p>Efforts from Steve Davis and Long early in the second half suggested the home side were anxious to avoid a repeat of the nervy first period and they established a comfort zone when Ryan Bertrand\xe2\x80\x99s drilled cross was diverted past Tom Heaton off Shackell\xe2\x80\x99s knee.</p>'
