b"<p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger has said Arsenal have a even chance of signing the Villarreal centre-back Gabriel Paulista and that negotiations over a \xc2\xa315m deal are progressing.</p> <p>Any transfer for the Brazilian will be complicated by work permit issues. Gabriel has not yet featured for his country, meaning the club would have to appeal for an exemption under the \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional talent\xe2\x80\x9d rule.</p> <p>The Spanish club are holding out for the \xe2\x82\xac20m in a buy-out clause but Arsenal prefer to pay a lower up-front fee, thought to be around \xc2\xa36m, with add-ons. The manager believes the two clubs are close to an agreement.</p>  <p> Related: Transfer news: 'no possibility' of Juan Cuadrado joining Chelsea \xe2\x80\x93 live! </p>   <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe talks are progressing quite well. Can we find an agreement or not? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. We are slowly progressing and there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance. It\xe2\x80\x99s 50/50,\xe2\x80\x9d he said on Thursday. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are ready to pay the price for a player if he is good enough. If the price is right, we will pay.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Wenger said the club would battle to get Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s a work permit should the deal go through rather than wait until the summer when changes to the system would make getting a visa easier.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFirst of all, I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the logic of this rule. Secondly if a player we want needs a work permit we\xe2\x80\x99ll defend it [the application] now. We don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily want to do it in the summer. We are short now so no mater what the rules are, we have to do it now.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Asked if Gabriel could represent the end of his January business, should he arrive, Wenger said this was not necessarily the case.</p>     Gabriel Paulista could be on his way to north London.
