b'Mario Balotelli\xe2\x80\x99s half-time shirt swap leaves Brendan Rodgers fuming'


b'<p>Brendan Rodgers is planning to reprimand Mario Balotelli after another disappointing night for Liverpool in the Champions League and the latest demonstration that their manager is growing increasingly frustrated by the behaviour and form of the player he signed to take Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez\xe2\x80\x99s place.</p> <p>Rodgers confirmed he was unhappy with Balotelli\xe2\x80\x99s decision to swap shirts with Pepe before they had gone down the tunnel at the end of a first half in which Real Madrid had scored all their goals in a 3-0 win. Liverpool disciplined Mamadou Sakho when he did the same with Samuel Eto\xe2\x80\x99o in a game at Chelsea last December and Rodgers did not hide his annoyance about a player whose signing Jamie Carragher, analysing his former club in his television role, described as \xe2\x80\x9ca panic\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe will deal with it,\xe2\x80\x9d Rodgers said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had an incident with a player last year and we did it internally. It is not something I stand for. If you want to do that, you do it at the end of the game. It is something I will deal with tomorrow.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99s thinly-veiled criticisms of Balotelli, while explaining why he had substituted him at half-time, also showed how exasperated the Liverpool manager is becoming with a player who has scored only once, against Ludogorets, since his \xc2\xa316m move from Milan.</p> <p>Rodgers praised the substitute Adam Lallana for his workrate with the clear implication that Balotelli had not been trying hard enough. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was purely tactical,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAdam Lallana came on and he was tireless. That\xe2\x80\x99s the minimum requirement here. You need to press and you need to work. I felt we needed a bit more movement centrally to occupy the centre halves.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Cristiano Ronaldo gave Madrid a 25th-minute lead and the Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or winner was clapped off by the Anfield crowd on a night when Karim Benzema scored twice to leave Liverpool with one win and two defeats from their opening three Champions League games.</p> <p>There were isolated cheers for the announcement of Balotelli\xe2\x80\x99s substitution and Carragher was unsparing in his criticisms of the former Manchester City striker. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be surprised to see him here next season. It was just a panic; they needed someone. They left it too late. A lot of the players have come in and done a decent job here and there, but nobody\xe2\x80\x99s really done anything. They bring in Balotelli late on \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s obviously a panic.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Jamie Redknapp, also part of Sky\xe2\x80\x99s coverage, questioned why Liverpool had signed Balotelli in the first place. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t blame Mario Balotelli \xe2\x80\x93 I blame Brendan Rodgers for bringing him here. How he thought he could turn around a player that Mourinho, Mancini, Prandelli have all washed their hands of \xe2\x80\xa6</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a reason when you go to the supermarket and things are half price. Why on earth they went for him, I\xe2\x80\x99ll never know. They should have just left him alone. The fact he [Rodgers] went and got him, it just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any sense to me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
