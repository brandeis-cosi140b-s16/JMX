b'Frosinone join Carpi to Lotito\xe2\x80\x99s discomfort with fairytale promotion | Paolo Bandini'


b'<p>The end of Italian football is nigh. Or at least, that is how Claudio Lotito may view things. The Lazio owner had much to celebrate on Saturday night, his team taking another big stride toward the Champions League as they won 1-0 away to Sampdoria. But his joy will have been tempered by the news that Frosinone had secured their promotion to Serie A earlier in the same day.</p> <p>To most observers, this was a footballing fairytale. Frosinone represent a town of 46,000 people, tucked in among the Ernici and Lepini mountain ranges just south of Rome. Their team, first founded in 1912 has never competed in Serie A. This time last year they were playing in the Lega Pro \xe2\x80\x93 Italy\xe2\x80\x99s third-tier.</p> <p>Lotito, though, takes a less romantic view. He made that much clear during a now-infamous phone call to Pino Iodice, a director at the Lega Pro club Ischia Isolaverde, which was published on the website of La Repubblica this February. In among a broader discourse on Italian football\xe2\x80\x99s power structures, and his own importance within them, Lotito stressed the damage that he felt would be done by having smaller clubs promoted to the top-flight.</p> <p>Specifically, he referenced both Frosinone and Carpi \xe2\x80\x93 the latter representing a town of 70,000 people in Emilia-Romagna. The transcript ran as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cI said to [the Serie B president] Abodi: \xe2\x80\x98Andrea, we need to change. If you bring me up Carpi \xe2\x80\xa6 One can come up \xe2\x80\xa6 If you bring me teams who are not worth a fuck, in two or three years we will not have a lira left.\xe2\x80\x99</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBecause when I go to sell the TV rights \xe2\x80\x93 which brought in \xe2\x82\xac1.2bn thanks to my skill, I managed to bring Sky and Mediaset together, in 10 years nobody had managed that \xe2\x80\x93 in three years, if we have Latina, Frosinone, who the fuck will buy the rights? They don\xe2\x80\x99t even know that Frosinone exist.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Carpi\xe2\x80\x99s supporters responded with wit, presenting a banner at their next home game that read, \xe2\x80\x9cLotito, il tuo calcio ci fa Skyfo\xe2\x80\x9d. They were telling the Lazio owner that his view of football disgusted them but intentionally misspelled the final word, schifo, in a nod to the broadcasters whose views he professed to represent.</p> <p>Their team came up with an even better response, sealing promotion to the top flight at the end of last month. Two and a half weeks later, Frosinone have now joined them. As the latter club\xe2\x80\x99s president, Maurizio Stirpe, remarked on Saturday evening: \xe2\x80\x9cLotito is a great soothsayer. He saw it all coming.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>If the Lazio owner was no doubt correct that Carpi and Frosinone \xe2\x80\x93 with average attendances of 2,991 and 5,087 respectively \xe2\x80\x93 hold less appeal to broadcasters than rivals such as Bologna or Bari, then he might also have wanted to consider the positive example each club can set. Neither appears to have spent beyond their means to reach this point, building their success not on the backs of overpaid stars but instead well-rounded collectives.</p> <p>At a time when prominent figures within Italian football have expressed anxiety about the lack of opportunities being afforded to young domestic talents, Carpi arrive boasting a first-team squad whose average age is just 24.4 years old, and which contains only a handful of foreign players. Their annual player wage bill is a paltry \xe2\x82\xac3m (\xc2\xa32.17m). They turned a profit, even if only a very modest one (\xe2\x82\xac51,922) on their accounts for 2014.</p> <p>Frosinone\xe2\x80\x99s squad is a little older, with an average age of 26.4, but once again dominated by Italians. The stars of this campaign have been a pair of journeyman lower-league strikers. Daniel Ciofani and Federico Dionisi, 29 and 27 respectively, have played a combined four games of top-flight football in their careers but have banged in 26 goals between them this season in Serie B.</p> <p>Both clubs will need to strengthen to survive at the highest level but they do have good role models to follow. Empoli have comfortably kept afloat in Serie A with a squad whose combined salary at the start of this campaign stood at \xe2\x82\xac11m. Sassuolo have stayed up for two consecutive seasons by relying on a core of cheap Italian footballers.</p> <p>The Neroverdi had just one foreign player in the team that beat Milan 3-2 this weekend. Saphir Ta\xc3\xafder put in a so-so shift before being substituted early in the second-half but the stage belonged principally to his team-mate Domenico Berardi. After scoring four against Milan in the corresponding fixture last season, the Italy Under-21 striker had to settle for three this time around.</p> <p>His first goal, admittedly, should never have stood. The Milan goalkeeper Diego L\xc3\xb3pez blundered in allowing an unremarkable shot to bounce off his chest but recovered to pull the ball back before it had crossed the line. Somehow, the fourth official saw things differently.</p> <p>Such errors will hopefully be eliminated in Serie A next season, when Hawk-Eye will be introduced to help adjudicate on goalline decisions. It was supposed to be given a first run in this season\xe2\x80\x99s Coppa Italia final between Lazio and Juventus but that plan has now been aborted after the game was moved from the end of the season to the middle of this week.</p> <p>This late switch \xe2\x80\x93 brought on by Juventus\xe2\x80\x99s success in reaching the Champions League final, scheduled to take place one day before the original Coppa Italia final date \xe2\x80\x93 has led to entirely predictable problems that the footballing authorities have (entirely predictably) failed to prepare for.</p> <p>Lazio had been due to face Roma this coming Sunday, in a derby with huge implications for the top-three race. Lotito has protested that it is unfair to play this game so soon after the rescheduled cup final, and requested that it be moved back by one day \xe2\x80\x93 to Monday 25 May. Roma are less keen on this switch, as indeed will be the many hundreds of fans (and, ahem, journalists) with travel and hotel plans constructed around the game.</p> <p>A decision is expected from the league by the end of today. Unlike in the cases of Frosinone and Carpi, the suspicion is that this time Lotito will get his way.</p> Talking points <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Lotito\xe2\x80\x99s Lazio, incidentally, remain one point behind Roma in the standings \xe2\x80\x93 after the Giallorossi recovered from a goal down to beat Udinese on Sunday night. Roma remain a very long way from the team that we saw in the first half of this season but if any one player has maintained a high level throughout then it is Radja Nainggolan, who scored his fifth goal of the season and very nearly added a stupendous second, meeting Juan Iturbe\xe2\x80\x99s cross with a glorious inside-of-the-heel flick that Orestis Karnezis just barely managed to push on to the post.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Also in that game: a first Serie A goal for Udinese\xe2\x80\x99s 19-year-old Chelsea loanee Stipe Perica.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Lazio\xe2\x80\x99s goal against Sampdoria was scored by Santiago Gentiletti \xe2\x80\x93 in what was the defender\xe2\x80\x99s first appearance after an eight-month injury lay-off. The setting might have provided him with an additional layer of closure. He had torn his knee ligaments in the first place at the Marassi, during a 1-0 loss to Genoa in September.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Cagliari have now been mathematically relegated, after defeat at home to Palermo. Their slide into Serie B had been on the cards for months but they had hoped at least to achieve a stay of execution against opponents who had won only twice away from home all season. Their caretaker manager, Gianluca Festa, insisted on taking his share of the blame afterwards but suggested that he would be willing to stay on next season if the club was keen. He has collected seven points from his five games in charge.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Noteworthy from that game was the omission of Paulo Dybala from Palermo\xe2\x80\x99s team. Giuseppe Iachini, the coach, confirmed that the player \xe2\x80\x93 who has scored 13 goals this season \xe2\x80\x93 would be sold to Juventus this summer but added that the Argentinian\xe2\x80\x99s strike partner was expected to remain. \xe2\x80\x9c[Franco] V\xc3\xa1zquez said he does not know where he will play next year? The club wants to keep him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Iachini. \xe2\x80\x9cDybala, on the other hand, is a Juventus player. We are working for the future.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 A low-key Derby d\xe2\x80\x99Italia at San Siro on Saturday, Juventus beating Internazionale even with a weakened side. The Nerazzurri had started well, Mauro Icardi opening the scoring with his sixth strike in five Serie A appearances against Juve before Marcelo Brozovic had a goal wrongly disallowed for offside. But Inter reminded us of their defensive frailty soon enough with Nemanja Vidic giving away his fourth penalty of the season after being outpaced by Alessandro Matri. Claudio Marchisio equalised from the spot before \xc3\x81lvaro Morata put Juventus in front with the help of a goalkeeping howler from Samir Handanovic. Inter remain in the Europa League hunt only because Genoa were denied a Uefa licence.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Things might have worked out differently for Inter, of course, if it were not for the outlandish efforts of Marco Storari. Even at 38 he must still be one of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s best back-up goalkeepers.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 As for Genoa, that\xe2\x80\x99s nine goals in two games for Gian Piero Gasperini\xe2\x80\x99s team. Iago Falque alone has scored 11 goals since the start of 2015.</p> <p>Results: Atalanta 1-4 Genoa, Cagliari 0-1 Palermo, Internazionale 1-2 Juventus, Roma 2-1 Udinese, Sampdoria 0-1 Lazio, Sassuolo 3-2 Milan, Torino 2-0 Chievo, Verona 2-1 Empoli</p>'
