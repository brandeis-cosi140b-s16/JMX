b'<p>Paul Scholes has described Louis van Gaal as \xe2\x80\x9ca mad genius\xe2\x80\x9d who will bring to Manchester United the combination of charisma, ability, intimidation and fear with which Sir Alex Ferguson inspired a succession of title-winning charges.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t really come across him a lot,\xe2\x80\x9d said Scholes, who retired in 2013 following a trophy-laden career at Old Trafford and has recently joined BT Sport\xe2\x80\x99s team of pundits. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom what I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen in pre-season he looks a bit mad to me. He\xe2\x80\x99s a bit like a mad genius, he looks a bit crazy.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think he\xe2\x80\x99s brought a bit of fear back into the players, which is no bad thing. I played for 20 years for Sir Alex Ferguson and he could be a scary man. Sometimes fear can bring performances out from you. There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt these players need to perform this year or they won\xe2\x80\x99t be there for very long. Players will know where they stand, which is what you want. You knew where you stood with Sir Alex Ferguson. This manager has great experience with proper clubs and has been successful. Hopefully he can bring a bit of that to us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Scholes briefly returned to United at the end of last season as an assistant to Ryan Giggs following the sacking of David Moyes, as the team limped to a massively disappointing seventh place. \xe2\x80\x9cThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a great season. Confidence was at an all-time low,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think this manager has brought the confidence back. You can\xe2\x80\x99t take a lot from pre-season games but if you look back to last year it was a bit of a shambles. They got beat by an all-star Singha XI or something. Those things don\xe2\x80\x99t happen to United.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ll be a lot better this year. The first six games look favourable and if they can be near or top of the league at the end of those then you take it from there. They\xe2\x80\x99ve got players who should be good enough. People like Tom Cleverley and Ashley Young took a lot of stick last season but you don\xe2\x80\x99t become bad players overnight. These players know how to win leagues. It\xe2\x80\x99s only Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera, who have just come in, and Juan Mata and Marouane Fellaini who haven\xe2\x80\x99t won the league. I just worry that City and Chelsea have a bit too much for them.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Since the end of last season United have lost the core of their last title-winning defence, with Rio Ferdinand moving to Queens Park Rangers and both Nemanja Vidic and Patrice Evra now based in Italy, at Internazionale and Juventus respectively. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s massive,\xe2\x80\x9d said Scholes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Rio and Vidic were on song it makes your job so much easier as a midfield player, because you know when it gets to your defence Rio is just going to take that ball off them. The midfield don\xe2\x80\x99t have that freedom any more and maybe they don\xe2\x80\x99t have so much confidence in their back line.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cNormally it\xe2\x80\x99s part of the team that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change too much. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s time for other players to step up. The biggest thing with the three central defenders now is fitness. Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Jonny Evans all seem to pick up quite a few injuries, which is worrying. I know Van Gaal likes Michael Keane and Tyler Blackett, but are they ready to come into a team and win the league yet? I\xe2\x80\x99m not so sure. They are capable of getting close, but I think the best we can hope for is a Champions League place.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Manchester United v Swansea City is one of 38 Barclays Premier League matches exclusively live on BT Sport this season along with top games from the FA Cup, UEFA Europa League and live action from more top flight football leagues than any other UK TV provider</p>'
