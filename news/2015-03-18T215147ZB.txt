b'<p>The phrase in Spanish is ganar sin despeinarse. It means to win without even having to mess your hair up and, though Manchester City did briefly threaten to make something implausible happen, they were powerless ultimately to prevent this being one of those occasions. They were outclassed for the most part and the only glimmer of consolation is that Barcelona, and Lionel Messi, on this form could leave even the most distinguished opponents on their knees.</p> <p>Are Bar\xc3\xa7a back to their exceptional best? They certainly gave that impression at times on a night when the number of chances Messi and his colleagues stacked up gave the narrow margin of victory a deceptive appearance.</p> <p>Joe Hart put on one of the outstanding performances of his life to keep the score down and Messi must feel perplexed that he could decorate the game so elegantly yet be deprived of another goal for his personal collection. Messi brought the crowd to its feet, bewitched us with his footwork, found gaps that didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to exist and danced past opponents in a way that took the art of dribbling to its highest level. He did everything, in fact, apart from beat the opposition goalkeeper.</p> <p>Hart\xe2\x80\x99s brilliance earned him a long embrace at the final whistle from Luis Su\xc3\xa1rez and the Uruguayan\xe2\x80\x99s face was one of wonder. Hart\xe2\x80\x99s goalkeeping had prevented a rout and, amid that portfolio of second-half saves, it is just a pity from City\xe2\x80\x99s perspective that Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s other players could not be so inspired.</p> <p>They had their chance in the 77th minute when Gerard Piqu\xc3\xa9 brought down Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero but Marc-Andr\xc3\xa9 ter Stegen kept out the striker\xe2\x80\x99s penalty and that save removed any lingering argument. Everyone knew from that point onwards that the quarter-finals would go ahead without a single English team.</p> <p>City, unlike Arsenal and Chelsea, could not even claim they were particularly close at any stage. Bar\xc3\xa7a\xe2\x80\x99s football was dizzying at times, continuing where they had left off from the first leg. Messi looked absolutely determined to make up for that moment in Manchester when his stoppage-time penalty came back off Hart.</p>           Barcelona should have scored more goals against Manchester City, says Luis Enrique.    <p>The four-times world player of the year was somewhere close to his exhilarating peaks and that, in football terms, is an exquisite form of bullying. James Milner made the mistake of diving in at one point. The nutmeg from Messi left him on his backside and, high in the stands, Pep Guardiola could be seen with his head in his hands, howling with laughter at the impudence of his former player. By that stage, Messi had already done the same to Fernandinho. Neymar, however, was the first. The nutmeg is football\xe2\x80\x99s most patronising put-down; it happened to Fernandinho twice in a quarter of an hour during the first half. They were taking turns to humiliate him.</p> <p>Neymar was bright, elusive and dangerous. Su\xc3\xa1rez was as busy as always. Mostly, though, it was a beautifully choreographed show from the little guy in the No10 shirt. At times Messi would just amble around but that slow walk was a deception. Suddenly he would be on the ball, picking up speed, causing mayhem. It was a masterclass.</p> <p>Su\xc3\xa1rez and Neymar both struck a post during the first half. After the break, there was a disallowed goal from Jordi Alba and so many saves from Hart it was easy to lose count. City did at least start to play with a sense of adventure in that period. Their problem, nonetheless, was getting hold of the ball and not opening themselves to the swift, incisive counterattacking of Bar\xc3\xa7a\xe2\x80\x99s front three. Luis Enrique\xe2\x80\x99s players kept the ball with so much more refinement than their opponents and when they did give up possession they hunted in a pack to get it back. Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 was on the game\xe2\x80\x99s edges. Samir Nasri was removed at half-time, failing again on the big stage, and Vincent Kompany had another error-strewn night. City\xe2\x80\x99s was a frequently panicked defence.</p> <p>Pellegrini had at least abandoned the 4-4-2 system that played into Bar\xc3\xa7a\xe2\x80\x99s hands in the first leg but even a player with Silva\xe2\x80\x99s qualities can look inferior in the presence of Andr\xc3\xa9s Iniesta. Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s decision to play Bacary Sagna rather than Pablo Zabaleta made little difference and when the goal arrived, after 31 minutes, it was brilliantly constructed.</p> <p>Messi, inevitably, was prominently involved and his curling pass, from right to left, to pick out Rakitic\xe2\x80\x99s run was expertly delivered. Yet there was a lovely, deceptive touch, too, as he collected Alba\xe2\x80\x99s pass and backed off Aleksandar Kolarov in one movement. Alba\xe2\x80\x99s swift break out of defence had caught City on the break. Milner hurried back to double up on Messi with Kolarov but the little magician gives the impression sometimes he would not be fazed if there were half a dozen players trying to stop him. Messi simply kept advancing, floated the ball into Rakitic for the Croat to control the cross on his chest then clip his shot over City\xe2\x80\x99s goalkeeper.</p> <p>What followed from Hart was extraordinary, the highlight coming late on when he kept out Messi inside the six-yard area. Hart may never have played with greater authority but a club with City\xe2\x80\x99s ambitions will not want to remember these occasions because of their goalkeeper\xe2\x80\x99s heroics. Once again, they had come up short and the gap seems to be widening rather than getting any smaller.</p>         '
