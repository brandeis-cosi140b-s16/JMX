b'<p>Liverpool have cancelled contract talks with Raheem Sterling after his agent was quoted as saying that the England winger would \xe2\x80\x9cdefinitely not be signing\xe2\x80\x9d a new contract, even if he was offered \xc2\xa3900,000 a week.</p> <p>Aidy Ward, who represents Sterling, was due to meet the Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers and chief executive Ian Ayre on Friday to discuss his client\xe2\x80\x99s contract situation but after the emergence of Ward\xe2\x80\x99s comments, the Merseyside club have put discussions on hold.</p> <p>Ward has subsequently disputed the comments that were published in the Evening Standard on Thursday and has reportedly threatened legal action, but this does not appear to have had an effect on those inside the club.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t care about the PR of the club and the club situation. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care,\xe2\x80\x9d Ward was quoted as saying. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is definitely not signing. He\xe2\x80\x99s not signing for \xc2\xa3700, \xc2\xa3800, \xc2\xa3900 thousand a week. He is not signing.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy job is to make sure I do the best with them [my clients]. If people say I am bad at my job, or they are badly advised it does not matter.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ward also launched a personal attack on Jamie Carragher \xe2\x80\x93 calling him \xe2\x80\x9ca knob\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 after the former Liverpool legend was critical of the way that Sterling and his representatives had handled the contract negotiations.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cCarragher is a knob. Everybody knows it. Any of the criticism from current pundits or ex-Liverpool players \xe2\x80\x93 none of them things matter to me. It is not relevant.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ward\xe2\x80\x99s comments will be of keen interest to both Manchester United, who registered their interest in Sterling on Wednesday. Manchester City and Chelsea are also thought to be keen on the England winger, who recently rejected a five-year, \xc2\xa3100,000-a-week offer from Liverpool.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI am not worried,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Ward. \xe2\x80\x9cWorried is making a decision not knowing what is going to happen. Every Premier League club will make a bid for him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
