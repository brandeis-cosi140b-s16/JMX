b'BREAKING NEWS: 34-YEAR-OLD MAN WAS BETTER AT FOOTBALL WHEN 24-YEAR-OLD MAN  <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s another quiet Friday, so with no news to report, the Fiver has decided to assist a down-on-their-luck professional footballer with their contract negotiations, by publishing a few quotes brazenly designed to chivvy along their contract negotiations. Here\xe2\x80\x99s $tevie Mbe, who today admitted that his time at the heart of Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s midfield might soon be over. In terms of what the world already knew, news that the leggy legend can no longer seriously cut it at the very top level, his jaw now regularly seen hanging loose as he pants and runs around in circles like a confused dog who has misplaced his squeaky bone, is up there with other breaking stories such as JFK SHOT, MAN LANDS ON MOON and BIG FIRE AT REICHSTAG.</p> <p>But of course that\xe2\x80\x99s not the point he was making. The point he was making was that he might naff off somewhere else if Liverpool don\xe2\x80\x99t get their act together and fast. Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s contract runs out in the summer, and presently the club have their feet up on the desk, either as a result of laziness, ineptitude, or dare we suggest it, sheer ambivalence. With time running out, and Gerrard free in January to sign a pre-contract agreement with an overseas club, perhaps in Spain, Italy, the USA or the Faroe Islands, the player has deemed it necessary to rattle a few cages. \xe2\x80\x9cI won\xe2\x80\x99t be retiring this summer,\xe2\x80\x9d he announced in an interview with one of the Guardian\xe2\x80\x99s rival papers, Rival Paper. \xe2\x80\x9cI will play beyond this season. We will have to wait and see if that\xe2\x80\x99s at Liverpool or somewhere else. That\xe2\x80\x99s Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Those Liverpool fans yet to be totally convinced by Joe Allen\xe2\x80\x99s commanding, domineering, nay Sounessesque presence will be hoping that the club come to their senses and offer their captain the cuddle-in-shape-of-contract-extension he craves. And then, just as wily old Rafa Ben\xc3\xadtez did when he got Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s number the best part of a decade ago, play him out on the right or behind the front man where, relieved of tactical responsibility, he can still do some damage without doing any damage. Chances are the fans will get their wish, as despite Gerrard\xe2\x80\x99s waning powers, Liverpool surely can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to lose a second totemic figure in quick succession, and chivvied accordingly, will soon pony up some cash. So as we suggested at the start, this is a bit of a non-story, really. But the only other option was something about Daniel Sturridge remaining knacked for the next couple of weeks, and, well, we may as well have run with breaking events in Dealey Plaza.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cExperience tells me not to read the press or listen to anything and that\xe2\x80\x99s what I do but when there is a headline like this? You think I could have made these comments? How do you think I can motivate my players? People who know me know that I would not gift anything to anyone, even to my father, who is in heaven and is what I love most in the world. I have been working in football for many years and these kinds of headlines pi$$ me off\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Granada coach Joaqu\xc3\xadn Caparr\xc3\xb3s gets the funk on during a press conference to such an extent that he rips up a copy of Marca, who he claims misquoted him as saying \xe2\x80\x9cI only ask that they do not steamroller us\xe2\x80\x9d before the game with Real Madrid.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel.

Today, Paul Scholes: \xe2\x80\x9cPeople thought he was camera-shy; he just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be bothered. None of us liked doing interviews, but it was a responsibility of the dressing room, you shared the load. \xe2\x80\x98Scholesy\xe2\x80\x99s too humble to do it.\xe2\x80\x99 Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s [effing] doing it now, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he? Maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s more money involved now.
