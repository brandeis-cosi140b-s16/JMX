b'Brendan Rodgers says Liverpool \xe2\x80\x98team ethos\xe2\x80\x99 missing after United defeat'


b'<p>Brendan Rodgers admitted he was struggling to recreate the team ethos of last season after Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s problems deepened with a 3-0 defeat at Manchester United. The pressure continues to mount on the manager, whose side stand seven points away from a Champions League berth.</p> <p>Goals from Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Robin van Persie secured United\xe2\x80\x99s sixth consecutive Premier League victory and left them third, eight points behind the leaders, Chelsea. Rodgers was left to reflect on a fresh setback for Liverpool following last week\xe2\x80\x99s elimination from the Champions League.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe want to recapture the team ethos,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had a team that was growing for a couple of years and has changed with injuries and whatever. It is just that emphasis on the team.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is pretty clear we are searching to find solutions in the game to get wins. The players are working incredibly hard. There is not a lack of effort. The attitude was first-class but, when you are not winning as consistently, the feelings are a little bit different but you want to get wins and concentrate on your performances.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Rodgers said Brad Jones, who replaced the dropped Simon Mignolet, would keep his place for Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s Capital One Cup quarter-final at Bournemouth. \xe2\x80\x9cI said to Simon it was for an indefinite period,\xe2\x80\x9d Rodgers said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has played in a lot of games and Brad, in my first year, came in and did very well. It is something that can happen to keepers, taking them out of the firing line and giving them time to reflect.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Of Glen Johnson, who suffered an injury, Rodgers added: \xe2\x80\x9cGlen has stretched his groin.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
