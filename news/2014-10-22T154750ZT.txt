b'The Fiver | One, two or perhaps seven almighty smacks in the mouth'


b'REMEMBERING THE GOOD OLD DAYS: RONALD REAGAN, THE MARK-THREE FORD ESCORT, AND PROPER CUP <p>Liverpool used to be better than Real Madrid. Yep. The Fiver would normally advise any disbelieving child under the age of 35 to seek confirmation from mater or pater about this. But here comes the Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s time-travelling late-70s/early-80s throwback cousin, New Romantic Rubik\xe2\x80\x99s Cube Free Market Monetarism Disco Carter Reagan Callaghan Thatcher Sitcom Themes Written By Ronnie Hazlehurst JR Ewing Smokey And The Bandit II Ford Escort Mark III Fiver! Why don\xe2\x80\x99t we just ask him? So, were Liverpool once better than Real Madrid? \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d says New Romantic Rubik\xe2\x80\x99s Cube Free Market Monetarism Disco Carter Reagan Callaghan Thatcher Sitcom Themes Written By Ronnie Hazlehurst JR Ewing Smokey And The Bandit II Ford Escort Mark III Fiver, before putting on a brown suit and going out on strike.</p> <p>But times change, and tonight Real, the reigning European champions, are widely expected to rock up at Anfield in Big Cup and give the hosts one, two or perhaps seven almighty smacks in the mouth. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve only canvassed the opinion of the more optimistic Liverpool fans. Now, Real have never beaten Liverpool in competitive football. Indeed they\xe2\x80\x99ve lost all three games they\xe2\x80\x99ve played against the Reds: 1-0 and 4-0 reverses in Big Cup in 2009, and a 1-0 defeat in the 1981 final of the precursor to Big Cup, Proper Cup. But that record\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely to last much longer, not if Real\xe2\x80\x99s current form is anything to go by. They\xe2\x80\x99ve won their last seven matches on the bounce, a run which has included two 5-0 wins, two 5-1s, and an 8-2, plus 14 goals for Cristiano Ronaldo alone. By way of juxtaposition, there was Liverpool playing at QPR.</p> <p>Still, anything\xe2\x80\x99s worth a go, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it. And tonight Brendan Rodgers will be pinning all his hopes on Mario Balotelli. Everyone else meanwhile will be more realistically looking to Raheem Sterling, who has today once again found himself the subject of ludicrous headlines thanks to Mr Roy. Turns out Sterling went out to a London nightclub two days after helping England to win a game of football in Estonia. How dare he? Not only was the so-called tired player flagrantly awake, he was also clearly not dressed in a hair shirt. In fact, given that all this was going on last week, during the preposterous height of Sleepygate, the whole situation could almost be read as Sterling giving a stiff two-fingered salute in response to all that self-righteous moralising. Liverpool will be hoping their young star has a similarly impressive answer tucked up his sleeve for Real.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Scott Murray for Liverpool 0-2 Real Madrid while Paul Doyle will have Anderlecht 1-2 Arsenal from 7.45pm tonight.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHaving spoken with many of the victims in this case it appears that Abalimba is a charming and charismatic individual who was able to call on his previous football experience and the fact he bears some resemblance to the real Ga\xc3\xabl Kakuta to deceive them\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Police sergeant Adam Cronshaw comments on the jailing of failed footballer Medi Abalimba, convicted of impersonating Ga\xc3\xabl Kakuta \xe2\x80\x93 potentially the perfect crime since no one knows what the Chelsea player actually looks like, given his perma-loan status.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel.

It\xe2\x80\x99s far too high brow. If the Fiver had a Basque cousin (who would definitely be separate from your Spanish cousin), then their drink of choice would be kalimotxo, a drink which translates as \xe2\x80\x98Black Vulture\xe2\x80\x99 in Chile and \xe2\x80\x98Diesel fuel\xe2\x80\x99 in Romania\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Paul Dixon.</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
