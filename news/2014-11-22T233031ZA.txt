b'Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger calls players naive after Arsenal lose to Manchester United'


b'<p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger accused his players of being \xe2\x80\x9cnaive\xe2\x80\x9d after a 2-1 defeat to Manchester United that left Arsenal 15 points behind Chelsea at the top of the table and resulted in another show of mutiny against him from sections of the crowd.</p> <p>Wenger was also left worrying about whether Jack Wilshere has seriously damaged one of his troublesome ankles after the midfielder was forced off following a heavy tackle from the young United defender Paddy McNair.</p> <p>The result means Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s only four wins in the league this season have come against teams who are currently in the bottom seven and Wenger blamed poor defending and erratic finishing after Kieran Gibbs\xe2\x80\x99s own goal was followed by a breakaway strike from Wayne Rooney.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a game that we dominated for 80% of the time and we haven\xe2\x80\x99t dominated a game like that against Manchester United for a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the end of the day we were not efficient enough in the final third, defensively, and we made a mistake at the back which they took advantage of. That\xe2\x80\x99s the story of the game. We had plenty of chances and their goalkeeper is man of the match. That tells you the story. But defensively we were a bit naive.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Wojciech Szczesny was also forced off after being injured in the collision with Gibbs that preceded the opening goal but Wenger reported it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot bad\xe2\x80\x9d and concerns were more about Wilshere\xe2\x80\x99s condition given the midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s long history with ankle issues. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how bad it is because he tried to stay on and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Olivier Giroud scored in stoppage time after coming on as a late substitute on his return from injury, but United held on for their first away win of the season.</p> <p>Asked if it was United\xe2\x80\x99s best win since he took over, Louis van Gaal said: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. I was not pleased with the way we played in the first half. But it was an away game against a top team and we have won. So OK, then I can say yes.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut I have to say the first 35 minutes we gave the ball away so easily \xe2\x80\xa6 fortunately we have a very good goalkeeper.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Luke Shaw was forced off after just 15 minutes as Van Gaal saw yet another player added to his ever-lengthening injury list but he praised the efforts of his inexperienced defence as Chris Smalling, Tyler Blackett and McNair grew stronger as the game progressed.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFirst I hope the players are coming back from injuries because it\xe2\x80\x99s unbelievably difficult to create any consistency in the team. I am a coach who always has the same lineup, maybe I change one or two. But not constantly so many players.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cShaw came back from the international break and he is not fit enough. So we make him fit, then he is injured again, so I have to give Ashley Young a game \xe2\x80\x93 but Young is not fit either.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think these players have done fantastic, though. Blackett, McNair and Shaw \xe2\x80\x93 how old are they? You play against a top team like Arsenal and they are always changing position, so you need a lot of communication. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
