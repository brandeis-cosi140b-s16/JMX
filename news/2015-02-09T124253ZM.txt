b'<p>Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 and Wilfried Bony are returning to Ivory Coast to celebrate the Africa Cup of Nations triumph so will not be available for Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Stoke City on Wednesday evening.</p> <p>City\xe2\x80\x99s 1-1 draw with Hull City on Saturday left the champions seven points behind Chelsea and so they must defeat Stoke to retain realistic hopes of defending the title.</p> <p>As Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s side have been knocked out of the FA Cup, their next game is the visit of Newcastle United on Saturday week, meaning that is the first match Tour\xc3\xa9 and Bony, the new \xc2\xa326m signing from Swansea who is yet to make debut, can play in.</p> <p>Tour\xc3\xa9 captained the Ivory Coast to Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 9-8 penalty shoot-out win over Ghana in Equatorial Guinea, the midfielder taking a successful kick in a victory claimed by the goalkeeper Boubacar Barry, who scored the winning penalty having saved from his opposite number Razak Braimah.</p> <p>While Bony crashed his spot-kick against the crossbar, the Ivorians are expected in Abidjan on Monday for an official reception after becoming African champions for the first time since 1992.</p> <p>Bony said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe just want to enjoy it and think about nothing else for the rest of the week, then continue with our teams.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Tour\xc3\xa9 denied he intends to retire from international football. \xe2\x80\x9cLeaving? Retired? Me? I\xe2\x80\x99m 31, my friend. No, that\xe2\x80\x99s my brother [Kolo]. When you see something, you want to repeat it. But it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult, when you\xe2\x80\x99ve lost it before [in two previous finals]. But now I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to enjoy it with my friends.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
