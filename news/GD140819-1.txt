QPR close in on signings of Leroy Fer and Eduardo Vargas

Queens Park Rangers are closing in on two signings with Eduardo Vargas due to have a medical on Wednesday in readiness for a season-long loan from Napoli, following the Norwich City midfielder Leroy Fer¡¯s medical on Tuesday morning before a ¡ê7m transfer.

QPR¡¯s Premier League return did not go to plan on Saturday when they fell to a 1-0 home defeat to Hull City, after which the manager Harry Redknapp spoke of his desire to sign two midfielders and a striker.

Rangers have worked hard since to strengthen the squad, with deals understood to be close. Fer, a Holland international, is believed to be close to a move for a fee in the region of ¡ê7m from Norwich. The 24-year-old is expected to sign a three-year deal at Loftus Road, where he looks likely to be joined by the Chile international Vargas.

The Napoli striker has attracted interest from across Europe after a fine World Cup, but QPR are believed to have won the race to his signature. It is understood he will join on a season-long loan with a view to a permanent move.

The deal would see the attacker link up with a compatriot, Mauricio Isla, who joined on loan from Juventus earlier in the month.
