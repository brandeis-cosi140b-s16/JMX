b'Vincent Kompany\xe2\x80\x99s form highlights Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s title struggle'


b'<p>If this was the day Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s quest to join Manchester United and Chelsea in defending the Premier League crown crumpled, Vincent Kompany will have sour memories to contemplate for a long time.</p> <p>The captain\xe2\x80\x99s trials required only 11 minutes to be resumed. That was the moment Kompany scrambled to clear a short Fernandinho pass and was made a mug of by Philippe Coutinho, who snatched the ball and raced towards Joe Hart\xe2\x80\x99s goal.</p> <p>In a flash, he found Jordan Henderson and the midfielder swept inside before placing a peach of a 20-yard shot beyond Hart to give Liverpool a 1-0 lead.</p> <p>On Friday Manuel Pellegrini admitted speaking privately to Kompany after the defender\xe2\x80\x99s catastrophic performance in City\xe2\x80\x99s 2-1 loss to Barcelona, when he was criticised for each strike netted by the Catalan club in the Champions League last-16 first leg at the Etihad Stadium. The manager also defended Kompany in the same press conference, stating the Belgian would be inspired by the flak he received.</p> <p>Pellegrini might like to rethink that view after yet another error in a high-stakes match, following mistakes that include January\xe2\x80\x99s defeat to Arsenal, and in the Champions League against Roma and CSKA Moscow before Christmas.</p> <p>Asked about Kompany after this defeat which derived from Coutinho\xe2\x80\x99s 75th-minute winner after Edin Dzeko\xe2\x80\x99s equaliser, Pellegrini was hardly that protective of him.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI am concerned about the whole team,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pellegrini. \xe2\x80\x9cWe start this week against Barcelona and then today: it was not our team, we cannot lose so many balls with the technical players we have. That is more important to analyse than the performance of one player. It is more important to think as a team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As leader and the champions\xe2\x80\x99 alpha-defender, Kompany should have thrived in having to mark Raheem Sterling, as he often did on an afternoon when City were second best throughout.</p> <p>Yet when the ball was played into Sterling, Kompany, 28, appeared twice the age of the Liverpool forward, as he grappled with a footballer who can be jelly-like to contain.</p> <p>Mitigation could be found for these struggles further forward. When City are pinned back, as they were for long passages by the men in red, Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 can be a virtual spectator.There are attempts to spoil and thwart but the 31-year-old often fails as when Adam Lallana\xe2\x80\x99s speedy feet had him waltzing past the Ivorian to launch Liverpool on yet another first-half attack.</p> <p>Tour\xc3\xa9 was so out of sorts that the last act before half-time was a pass from the midfielder that went yards wide of Pablo Zabaleta and rolled out of play to the jeers of the Liverpool fans.</p> <p>Yet at half-time, City were level from a sweet move that was begun by Tour\xc3\xa9 and finished by Edin Dzeko.</p> <p>However, there had been scant other evidence of the pre-match billing given the 31-year-old by his older brother. \xe2\x80\x9cYaya is unbelievable. He\xe2\x80\x99s on another planet \xe2\x80\x93 one of the best in the game,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kolo Tour\xc3\xa9, the Liverpool defender.</p> <p>On his better days there is no argument with that, and with him in the XI City\xe2\x80\x99s hopes of closing to within two points of Chelsea were still rosier.</p> <p>If the opening phases featured a Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 whose contribution was limited to padding around on the periphery, floating in the odd pass to Dzeko, in the second half he appeared the most likely candidate to sweep City to the three points.</p> <p>There was a sweet long diagonal pass that Tour\xc3\xa9 put precisely on Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero\xe2\x80\x99s toe but the forward\xe2\x80\x99s touch failed him and Kompany\xe2\x80\x99s problems continued to plague City.</p> <p>When he fouled Sterling yet again, Mark Clattenburg, the referee, had a stern word with him and after the free-kick was taken Liverpool eventually fashioned a chance Sterling should have converted.</p> <p>As this invigorating contest neared its end Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 came close to clawing a valuable point back when he set off on a trademark run that scattered Liverpool before him.</p> <p>He found David Silva but the Spaniard could not finish. Kompany will hope this defeat and his part in it has not ended City\xe2\x80\x99s title hopes.</p>'
