b'Newcastle United v Chelsea: Premier League - as it happened | Scott Murray'


b'<p>So there goes Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s unbeaten record. And Jose\xe2\x80\x99s still not won a league game at Newcastle. But to be fair to the Chelsea manager, he embraces the fourth official with a smile, then offers Pardew a warm handshake. Well done to Newcastle, their two-goal hero Papiss Cisse, and their two goalkeepers, especially the young Jak Alnwick, making his debut against the Premier League favourites. And god speed young Rob Elliot Jnr.!</p>'
