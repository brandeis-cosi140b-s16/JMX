b'Southampton 1-2 Manchester United | Premier League match report'


b'<p>Neither the leaders nor the reigning champions will be quaking in their boots just yet but that ominous rumbling at their backs is Manchester United on the charge. Louis van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s side forced a fifth successive victory here, a win achieved in spite of clear defensive frailties, to suggest that they are the most likely contenders from the pack to challenge the duopoly at the top.</p> <p>Even with that burst of form behind them the pursuit still appears unlikely and quite whether a team so awkwardly thrown together at the back can sustain a long-term challenge, given the power of Chelsea and Manchester City, remains to be seen. Yet the thought of United building up a head of steam with funds to spend in January could yet prove unnerving to all-comers. This may have been an opportune time to visit Southampton, a team shorn of too many key performers, but the visitors departed having risen to third and heartened to have achieved success from a mishmash of a display.</p> <p>They admitted as much afterwards, the matchwinner Robin van Persie conceding they had not played well and Van Gaal claiming that only three of his players had justified their reputation. Southampton, as \xe2\x80\x9cthe better team\xe2\x80\x9d, had apparently merited more. Gary Neville, up in his pundit\xe2\x80\x99s role for television, went further to claim United had \xe2\x80\x9cgot away with murder\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 an assessment that provoked a rather more prickly reaction from his former club\xe2\x80\x99s manager. Liverpool await on Sunday, a game between \xe2\x80\x9cpub teams\xe2\x80\x9d according to Neville but a fixture to have the juices flowing. At some stage this side\xe2\x80\x99s deficiencies will return to haunt them but at present they have momentum.</p> <p>This ended up seeming ruthless. The three attempts at goal mustered by United represented their fewest in the Premier League in 11 years and, if it was appropriate that Van Persie should determine the result of this division\xe2\x80\x99s first game between Dutch managers, the win had seemed implausible for long periods. United had hardly stirred as an attacking force since taking an early lead courtesy of the first of Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s gifts and weathered regular pressure thereafter until Wayne Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s free-kick from deep looped over the clutter in the six-yard box. And there was Van Persie, with Marouane Fellaini just as untracked at his back, having meandered on to the looped delivery with ease. He prodded his finish through Fraser Forster\xe2\x80\x99s legs from close range and the Saints were beaten.</p> <p>Ronald Koeman was deflated by how obliging his own charges had been against opponents who appeared there for the taking. Jos\xc3\xa9 Fonte had set the tone with his errant backpass early on, delivered as Van Persie burst beyond him on his blind side to intercept and convert cleverly beyond a distraught goalkeeper. United created nothing else of note. \xe2\x80\x9cWe deserved more,\xe2\x80\x9d grumbled the home manager. \xe2\x80\x9cI said to my players: \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s easy, in my opinion, we were beaten by Manchester United tonight. We lost by ourselves.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>This was a third successive defeat but the trickiest to digest, given how ramshackle the visitors had appeared at the back. United lost Chris Smalling to a groin strain early on and hooked Paddy McNair off before the first half was up almost as a mercy, Van Gaal having grown alarmed at the mistakes that littered the youngster\xe2\x80\x99s game. He had almost presented Shane Long with the lead \xe2\x80\x93 not the only opportunity spurned by the Irishman \xe2\x80\x93 and had been one of those panicked by Steve Davis\xe2\x80\x99s burst just after the half-hour which culminated in Dusan Tadic\xe2\x80\x99s choked shot and Graziano Pell\xc3\xa8\xe2\x80\x99s slammed equaliser. McNair was left appearing a scapegoat, even if the Italian\xe2\x80\x99s first goal in a little under 10 hours owed more to Fellaini surrendering possession weakly in the centre.</p> <p>By the interval the visitors were employing Michael Carrick as a third centre-half while Jonny Evans desperately tried to rediscover some rhythm on his first appearance since the 5-3 capitulation at Leicester in September. Every permutation of United\xe2\x80\x99s rearguard looks fragile at present, the three-man combination far too awkward and neither Antonio Valencia or Ashley Young convincing as a wing-back. Southampton should have capitalised but Long\xe2\x80\x99s point-blank header was smartly pushed away by David de Gea, who later saved superbly from Pell\xc3\xa8. The goalkeeper has had to be United\xe2\x80\x99s most consistent performer this term out of necessity.</p> <p>Yet this team is still finding a way to prevail. Those 3m shares put up for sale by Edward Glazer during the game may have been worth rather more by the final whistle, when United had established themselves as the nearest challengers to the top two. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s fantastic now to be third in the table,\xe2\x80\x9d added Van Gaal before the realism kicked in yet again. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99d hope we\xe2\x80\x99d do that with a better performance because, tonight, we were the lucky team.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
