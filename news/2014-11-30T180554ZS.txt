b'Southampton get reality check against Manchester City but can recover | Paul Doyle'


b'<p>Manchester City fans fancy themselves as balladeers, frequently belting out \xe2\x80\x9cBlue Moon\xe2\x80\x9d without the slightest provocation, but their team are no romantics. Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s side had no truck with all that mushy talk about the title being destined for Liverpool last season, and at St Mary\xe2\x80\x99s they showed no tolerance for the widespread warm feelings towards Southampton. They whipped the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s top underdogs without compunction here.</p> <p>In the weeks before this match one simple observation kept occurring to Ronald Koeman, right, every time he was asked whether his team could sustain their promising start to the season: without ever getting carried away, the Dutchman would recite the mandatory \xe2\x80\x9ctake each game as it comes\xe2\x80\x9d line before adding a note of understated optimism: \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen many teams better than us this season.\xe2\x80\x9d He has certainly seen one now.</p> <p>Southampton were just above Manchester City in the table before this match but the champions\xe2\x80\x99 performance here amounted to a convincing explanation as to why those standings are unlikely to be repeated this season. City\xe2\x80\x99s third goal concluded the debate eloquently, with the depleted visitors sweeping forward from a Southampton corner and Ga\xc3\xabl Clichy ramming the ball into the corner after a sumptuous cross with the outside of the foot by Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero. Only two minutes earlier Shane Long had attempted a similar cross to Graziano Pell\xc3\xa8 as Southampton sought to cut the deficit to a single goal but Long\xe2\x80\x99s ball was fractionally too long or Pell\xc3\xa8\xe2\x80\x99s run fractionally too late. If one was admirable but not quite good enough, for the other by contrast every pass was perfect and the finish magnificently conclusive.</p> <p>Although Southampton were emphatically beaten in the end, and their previous two defeats this season had come against the only other members of last term\xe2\x80\x99s top six that they have met, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur, it is by no means certain that Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s side are about to plummet down the league the way Southampton did this time last season, when in the space of six weeks between late November and New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day they faced most of the top teams and fell from third in the table to ninth. The fixture list again bears no gifts for them this December, as they must take on Arsenal, Manchester United, Everton and Chelsea before the festive period is over, but this could still be a season for Southampton to be jolly.</p> <p>Much will depend on how they react to this defeat. They could justifiably claim to have been unfortunate in losing to Spurs and Liverpool but here any luck that was going went their way, most obviously when the referee, Mike Jones, booked Ag\xc3\xbcero for simulation after the Argentinian was tripped in the box by Jos\xc3\xa9 Fonte. Koeman made no attempt to dress it up, admitting candidly that his side had simply not been good enough to contain the champions. He also acknowledged that they began the game nervously. That, indeed, may have been a hangover from Monday\xe2\x80\x99s match at Aston Villa, where they had started as if too sure of themselves and ended up having to fight for a draw. But while Southampton did settle as the game progressed, City remained sharper throughout and their goals came when they pounced on uncharacteristic mistakes by the home side, Victor Wanyama and Steven Davis both giving the ball away in the run-up to goals.</p> <p>That was a pity, as for the middle period of the game, after the jittery start and thoughtless finish, Southampton gave as good as they got and it was apparent why they have risen so high in the table. Nathaniel Clyne was defending well even if not venturing forward as often as usual and Ryan Bertrand was doing both. The most accomplished home player early on was Morgan Schneiderlin, who had sought to set an example to his team-mates by dispossessing Fernandinho following a shuddering tackle in the third minute. Later in the half the Frenchman had the poise to undo City\xe2\x80\x99s defence with a dainty clip over the top for Pell\xc3\xa8, who failed to apply a proper connection to the dropping ball from close range before Joe Hart and Vincent Kompany combined to keep Saints out.</p> <p>When Schneiderlin was forced off by injury at half-time, Maya Yoshida was introduced and a reshuffle required, underlining the modesty of Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s squad compared with City\xe2\x80\x99s blinged-up armoury. \xe2\x80\x9cWe do not have 24 players like they have, we know that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Koeman. The visitors\xe2\x80\x99 first two substitutes, James Milner and Frank Lampard, emphasised that point by combining to put City 2-0 up despite the sending off of Eliaquim Mangala.</p> <p>Though it made no difference to the result here, Mangala\xe2\x80\x99s woe reinforced one reason why Koeman should remain optimistic. While the red card was the latest evidence that City\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa332m centre-back is struggling to adapt to the Premier League, Southampton\xe2\x80\x99s raft of new arrivals have mostly fared much better. Toby Alderweireld, for instance, was again immaculate in the heart of the defence and also did well when shifted into midfield after the departure of Schneiderlin. Pell\xc3\xa8 and Dusan Tadic were subdued, and Sadio Man\xc3\xa9 scatty, but they have generally enjoyed encouraging introductions to English football. Koeman\xe2\x80\x99s calm, clever approach has been key to that and the manager must now make sure his players do not become disillusioned by this belittling setback.</p>'
