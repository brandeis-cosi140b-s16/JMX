b'Arsenal 0-0 Sunderland | Premier League match report'


b'<p>The thought had occurred beforehand that these two clubs might have simply shaken on the draw. That, however, is not part of the make-up of this Premier League. There was no holding back during a game that rose extravagantly to the boil and it was a wonder it finished goalless. There were chances at both ends, particularly during a gripping second-half, many of them of crystal clarity.</p> <p>Yet the point apiece served everyone well, especially Sunderland, who could celebrate the retention of their top-flight status ahead of their final fixture at Chelsea on Sunday. The emotions ran wild at full time, with the travelling supporters cavorting in delight and Dick Advocaat breaking down in tears for what he would later say was the first time in his long career.</p>  <p> Related: Emotions snowball for Dick Advocaat after Sunderland clinch safety | Amy Lawrence </p>   <p>Advocaat has achieved the ends of his short-term managerial brief and he said that he and his players had defied the odds and the naysayers. When he took over in mid-March, the club sat 17th in the table, one point above the drop zone. His record reads impressively \xe2\x80\x93 W3 D3 L2 \xe2\x80\x93 and there have been calls for him to extend his stay in the north-east by another season before he retires. Advocaat has said that this will be his last managerial job. He will decide on his future next week.</p> <p>Advocaat and several of his players made the point that Sunderland could not keep on living like this, dicing with their Premier League status so routinely. With the facilities and the talent at the club, they had to be better. But this was an occasion to exhale or, to paraphrase Advocaat, let it all hang out.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy emotions came out when my friend [and assistant] Bert van Lingen came over, we have been 25 years together, and he started crying,\xe2\x80\x9d Advocaat said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said: \xe2\x80\x98Let it go,\xe2\x80\x99 so I said: \xe2\x80\x98Why not?\xe2\x80\x99 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t need so much encouragement. Nobody expected this. We had nine games when we took over, and five away from home, including Arsenal and Chelsea. But we did it, with everybody together. To do it here, on our own, against a great team, gives me a special feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>For Arsenal, the point has all but ensured a top-three finish \xe2\x80\x93 only a radical last-day swing of seven goals would usher Manchester United back into contention \xe2\x80\x93 and, for only the third time in 10 seasons, they will avoid a Champions League play-off. Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger stands to be able to sell this season as a success, particularly if his team go on to beat Aston Villa on Saturday week to retain the FA Cup.</p> <p>Wenger, though, lamented a lack of sharpness from his players, a legacy, he said, of the exertions from Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 1-1 draw at United \xe2\x80\x93 a result that has come to look more important. Arsenal have failed to score in their last three home games. \xe2\x80\x9cWe didn\xe2\x80\x99t look like scoring, honestly,\xe2\x80\x9d Wenger said. \xe2\x80\x9cEven if we had 28 shots on goal. There was always something missing.\xe2\x80\x9d There are worries, Wenger admitted, ahead of the Cup final.</p> <p>Advocaat was indebted to Costel Pantilimon, the goalkeeper, who made a string of fine saves but he could also point to the four clear chances that his team created and passed up in the second half. Steven Fletcher, on for the ineffective Danny Graham at half-time, spurned three of them, although his general play was worthy of praise.</p> <p>From Adam Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s pass, Fletcher was confronted by David Ospina only for the goalkeeper to block. On the hour, following a quick and direct break, the striker was again one-on-one with Ospina but fluffed the dinked finish. Fletcher will also wonder how he did not convert from close range after Patrick van Aanholt had flashed a shot across goal, while the Dutch full-back had earlier shot tamely at Ospina from Jermain Defoe\xe2\x80\x99s pass.</p>     Costel Pantilimon and John O\xe2\x80\x99Shea embrace to celebrate Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s survival. Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA    <p>Arsenal called the tune in the first half, pushing Sunderland back with trademark interchanges. The visitors struggled to escape their half. Jack Wilshere, who made his first start since 22 November, was thwarted at close quarters by Pantilimon and blazed another chance over from Aaron Ramsey\xe2\x80\x99s ball.</p> <p>Santi Cazorla worked Pantilimon; Mesut \xc3\x96zil lashed over from Wilshere\xe2\x80\x99s cute dink and Olivier Giroud scooped wide after a similar tee-up from Wilshere. It was all very pretty but lacking in punch.</p> <p>Sunderland measured their success in tackles won, closing down and blocks. John O\xe2\x80\x99Shea and Sebasti\xc3\xa1n Coates were excellent in central defence while Lee Cattermole snapped, snarled and generally irritated \xc3\x96zil.</p> <p>Sunderland came out as an attacking force after the interval but Arsenal remained threatening. Hector Beller\xc3\xadn made inroads up the right and from his crosses, Giroud and Kieran Gibbs drew eye-catching saves out of Pantilimon. Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez had a shot blocked by Coates.</p> <p>The visitors drank in a moment of good fortune when Ramsey\xe2\x80\x99s cross hit Billy Jones and cannoned off the post while the Arsenal substitute Theo Walcott went close before forcing the save of the evening from Pantilimon. Sunderland and Advocaat went through the mill. It made the result feel even sweeter.</p>'
