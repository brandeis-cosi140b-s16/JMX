b'Football transfer rumours: Kenedy to Manchester United?'


b'<p>Louis van Gaal, such great friends with Ryan Giggs that they sit down together and watch The Class of 92 on DVD every evening, has grand plans for Manchester United. He is going to sign Fluminese\xe2\x80\x99s Kenedy, the new Neymar apparently, for\xc2\xa35.7m and probably play him at right-back and then he\xe2\x80\x99s going to sign Arturo Vidal for \xc2\xa314m from Juventus and use him as a security guard at the training ground. Then he\xe2\x80\x99s going to plan a holiday with Giggsy, because the pair of them are famous friends. </p> <p>Arsenal and Liverpool are set to stage a medieval re-enactment in an attempt to battle it out for the Juventus striker \xc3\x81lvaro Morata. The Spaniard is available. Southampton are going to take Morgan Schneiderlin, a target for Arsenal and Tottenham, for a candle-lit dinner and tell him how much he means to them. Then they\xe2\x80\x99re going to get down to business and dump a bumper contract on the table. Chelsea have agreed a \xc2\xa32.3m deal for the Romanian youngster, Cristian Manea. The 17-year-old is going to be ace for Wolfsburg after completing a \xc2\xa347m move to the German side in a couple of years. We call it the De Bruyne Principle. </p> <p>Matija Nastasic is having such a time of it at Schalke that he wants to make his loan move from Manchester City permanent. And why not? City have Eliaquim Mangala and Mart\xc3\xadn Demichelis. </p> <p>Tottenham are after M\xc3\xa1laga\xe2\x80\x99s Ignacio Camacho. The Mill has racked its brain for two minutes and has come to the conclusion that it has nothing funny to say about that. Camacho is a midfielder! Will he be as good as Etienne Capoue and Paulinho? Ha! Ha! Ha! Chelsea are planning a swoop for the Real Madrid centre-back Rapha\xc3\xabl Varane, who will play a starring defensive midfield role in next year\xe2\x80\x99s 1-0 victory over Arsenal in the FA Cup final. </p>'
