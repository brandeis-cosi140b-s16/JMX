b'Football transfer rumours: Ignazio Abate or Joel Ward to Liverpool?'


b'<p>When the Mill was being trained up for its noble profession \xe2\x80\x93 learning the ropes, making the tea, answering its superiors politely \xe2\x80\x93 it was told, in the faintest of whispers, of a higher calling. Football is of no consequence, it rasped. Just 11 men kicking a ball around, you know. No satisfaction in it for you. No money. Understand all this and you, my boy, will be OK. You\xe2\x80\x99ll get the rewards in time. We\xe2\x80\x99ll make a Mario Balotelli Journalist of you yet.</p> <p>And we can touch it now, taste it, almost feel it \xe2\x80\x93 and if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t for Ignazio Abate getting in the way we\xe2\x80\x99d be lathering ourselves in milk and honey already. The Milan right-back is making a spirited landgrab for those Liverpool transfer headlines, the Mirror suggesting that he could be brought in as a possible replacement for Glen Johnson. And if not he, then perhaps Crystal Palace\xe2\x80\x99s Joel Ward. This is a all mere bump in the road, not career suicide. Besides \xe2\x80\x93 we all know who else used to play for Milan, don\xe2\x80\x99t we?</p> <p>Not Karim Bellarabi, sadly, so in a more blatant abdication of responsibilities we have more news from the Mirror that most of the Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 including Liverpool, and did you know they might want to freshen up their attack in January? \xe2\x80\x93 are keen on the Bayer Leverkusen winger. Joining this thoroughly eligible line of suitors are Manchester United, Arsenal, Spurs, Manchester City and Newcastle \xe2\x80\x93 a sequence that includes something known as bathos.</p> <p>What Mario needs \xe2\x80\x93 what we need too \xe2\x80\x93 is a new goalkeeper for him to score past! And here is one. V\xc3\xadctor Vald\xc3\xa9s has been spotted at Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s HQ by the world, his wife and people with no close relationship to the world whatsoever. Louis van Gaal is keen to see how he\xe2\x80\x99s shaping up after his knee ligament injury \xe2\x80\x93 and he could wind up as cover, or even very close competition, for David de Gea. All of this after he had been closely linked with a move to, yes, Liverpool.</p> <p>More \xe2\x80\x99keeper news. This time it\xe2\x80\x99s Petr Cech, whose days at Chelsea seem numbered and who, if Talksport are to be believed, might be up for joining rhythm guitar\xe2\x80\x99s Slaven Bilic at what might have been known 20 years ago as Crack Turkish Side Besiktas.</p> <p>Let\xe2\x80\x99s bring this back to the subject of strikers who may not be playing too much football in the foreseeable future. No, not him \xe2\x80\x93 this time it\xe2\x80\x99s Javier Hern\xc3\xa1ndez separating us from our objet d\xe2\x80\x99amour. He\xe2\x80\x99s played just four times for Real Madrid during his loan spell from Manchester United but his seated posture has made such an impression on Carlo Ancelotti that apparently the manager wants to get him signed up permanently, pronto.</p> <p>Not a single Balotelli rumour there. So if you\xe2\x80\x99ll excuse us, now, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a job to do.</p>'
