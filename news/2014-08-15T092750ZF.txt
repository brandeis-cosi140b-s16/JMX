b'Football transfer rumours: Real Madrid to sign Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Raheem Sterling?'


b'<p>In every class in every school, there\xe2\x80\x99s a kid who can swim like a torpedo, run like a cheetah and love like Shabba Ranks. Usually, he \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s almost always a he \xe2\x80\x93 will also have the strength of 10 men, a family of famous relatives, and an exchequer to shame an oil emirate. Except that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.</p> <p>Apropos of nothing, since buying two players for whom deals were already in place round about season-ticket renewal time, Edward Gareth \xe2\x80\x98Ed\xe2\x80\x99 Woodward, executive chairman of Manchester United, has achieved the cube root of nothing. United, who finished seventh last season, have added fewer players than any other club in the league, and only Patrice Evra has left; there have simply been briefings, boastings, and a share issue devolving no power but bringing in millions of free money specifically stated as going directly into owners\xe2\x80\x99 pockets. Why, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost as though his bosses have no interest whatsoever in football, glory or success, happy with Champions League qualification to keep pensions funds, shopping malls and current accounts happy.</p> <p>But the devilish ploy might have run into trouble. It is inconceivable that Louis van Gaal is satisfied with the circumstance, and now, the reassuringly expensive and accordingly unobtainable Juan Cuadrado is no longer desired by Barcelona. This leaves United as his sole remaining suitors, and without the salvation of any third-party ownership issues, a new excuse must be found for not signing a player perfect for Van Gaal\xe2\x80\x99s 3-5-2 system. In the meantime, Barcelona are going to buy Douglas, the S\xc3\xa3o Paulo full-back; this will involve making a sensible offer, commensurate to or slightly in excess of his market value, and will take a few days. But, should things not work out \xe2\x80\x93 because things sometimes don\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x93 they will simply repair to Flamengo, and leave with L\xc3\xa9o after a few days more. Now that\xe2\x80\x99s magic.</p> <p>Meanwhile, their partners in morality, Real Madrid, are apparently interested in Liverpool\xe2\x80\x99s Raheem Sterling \xe2\x80\x93 you know, that bloke who played well a few times last season and almost nearly almost scored against Italy. But Liverpool, unwilling to sell and always a trend-setter, will spark the 1990s revival long since in the post by offering the player a new contract worth a whole \xc2\xa330,000 a week. Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99ll work.</p> <p>Activities are also afoot in London. With Thibaut Courtois about to graduate from Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s feeder club, the place of Petr Cech is under threat. In a forlorn bid to make the matter about him, Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho will not reveal the identity of his first choice until Sunday; the world\xe2\x80\x99s hooks are duly tentered. But, with most expecting Courtois to be the pick, Real Madrid, Monaco and PSG are all ready to make offers for Cech.</p> <p>In other news, Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez has denied that, in exchange for Everton borrowing Chelsea players to do well against Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s direct competition and for Chelsea to reassure themselves that they\xe2\x80\x99re not all that good, Chelsea have first refusal on his players. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a good relationship and a professional relationship and I want to believe that they feel that they can trust us,\xe2\x80\x9d he grovelled \xe2\x80\x93 but denied any further transfer collusion.</p> <p>However, Chelsea are discussing the acquisition of Mehdi Benatia, the Roma centre-back. This will anger, infuriate and devastate Manchester United, desperate to be seen to be trying to buy him \xe2\x80\x93 but Benatia, apparently promised that he could leave if a payrise was not forthcoming, has, despite his distress, told supporters that he now expects to stay.</p> <p>Across London, Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger is in the market for the striker he\xe2\x80\x99s obviously needed for two seasons. His latest option is Napoli\xe2\x80\x99s Eduardo Vargas, but Valencia, newly flush with someone else\xe2\x80\x99s money are also keen \xe2\x80\x93 Vargas spent six months on loan with them last season, plundering a princely five goals in 25 appearances. Should Arsenal fail to complete the deal, they will simply find another tricksy attacker of unspecified position and questionable composure under pressure.</p>'
