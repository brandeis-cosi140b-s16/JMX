b'Are Manchester City in danger of missing out on next season\xe2\x80\x99s Champions League? | Paul Wilson'


b'<p>The extremely well-travelled Dick Advocaat has just described the Premier League as \xe2\x80\x9ca phenomenal competition\xe2\x80\x9d, somewhere he has always wanted to be.</p> <p>The Dutch coach is possibly putting a brave face on ending up at Sunderland, one point above the relegation zone and in need of an instant turnaround after another terrible season, but even so you have to marvel at someone whose eyes light up at the prospect of imminent fixtures against West Ham and Newcastle.</p> <p>Saying Sunderland are a very big club is a bit like saying the Premier League is the best/most entertaining/most competitive in the world. It sounds reasonable at first but does not bear much close examination. If the Premier League is so great, why are its clubs finding progress in Europe so difficult? If Sunderland are so huge, why are they attracted to the Championship like a toy diver sinking to the bottom of a lemonade bottle?</p>  <p> Related: Manuel Pellegrini: I\xe2\x80\x99ve never felt that if I don\xe2\x80\x99t win I\xe2\x80\x99m out at Manchester City </p>   <p>Yet whatever you think about the Premier League, there is no denying that a competition that produces a result such as the one at Turf Moor on Saturday has something going for it. Apparently Manchester City spent more money this season on Wilfried Bony and Eliaquim Mangala, two players they seem in no hurry to deploy, than Burnley have spent on transfer fees in their entire 132-year professional history. Just having teams as financially disparate as Burnley and City playing in the same division is quite remarkable; for one to beat the other \xe2\x80\x93 actually to take four points off the other and completely mess up their title aspirations \xe2\x80\x93 is nothing short of incredible.</p> <p>Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s winning goal was scored in some style by George Boyd, a journeyman winger who was at Hull last season, and has such a realistic appreciation of his place in the overall scheme of things that he expressed his gratitude to Steve Bruce amid the disappointment of last May\xe2\x80\x99s Wembley defeat by Arsenal because he never reckoned he would get anywhere near an FA Cup final.</p> <p>The result at Burnley, a game City were widely expected to win, has thrown the top four wide open. Chelsea are still firm favourites to finish first, although they are not performing as convincingly as they have been doing, but everyone from Arsenal to Manchester United to Liverpool are now talking of finishing second. It is certainly possible \xe2\x80\x93 a lot will depend on United\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Anfield on Sunday \xe2\x80\x93 and what cannot be ruled out either is City slipping further down the table.</p> <p>One would not wish at this stage to speculate that they may fall out of Champions League contention altogether, but what seemed a nailed-on top-two place is looking more flimsily attached. On the domestic front Arsenal, Liverpool and possibly even United at last are now doing what leading teams set out to do, putting together a strong finish, while City are in danger of losing their way completely.</p> <p>Certainly if they play as lethargically as they did in east Lancashire there can be no guarantee of staying where they are in the table. They are presently only a point above Arsenal and two above United, and if Liverpool win on Sunday they too will arrive in the top four with the intention of staying there.</p> <p>No wonder Manuel Pellegrini was at pains to stress the importance of continuing to pick up points in the league, no matter what happens in Europe. He claims he will not be hurried out of the door should City finish the season empty-handed, and he may be right. He is an experienced manager who now has a working knowledge of the Premier League and the English language, he is having to work with the signings his superiors bring in and City cannot keep chopping and changing every time a season does not go quite to plan. Yet Pellegrini cannot afford to finish third or fourth in a two-horse race, and anything worse than that hardly bears thinking about.</p> <p>This is not to pile pressure on City and their manager, merely to point out that the Premier League does have some saving graces. It is not home to the best football in the world, maybe not the most exciting either, but it ought to win a few bonus points for being competitive. When this was mentioned in this space a few weeks ago, along with the oft-quoted cliche (quoted often by Pellegrini and Louis van Gaal at any rate) a reader took the trouble to write in and take issue. He said the Premier League was actually one of the more predictable around, and if you counted up the number of times the team finishing last had actually beaten the team crowned as champions it almost never happens.</p> <p>This seemed to be missing the point. Last weekend at Turf Moor Burnley were not actually bottom and nor were City top, yet considering everything else that stood between the two clubs the result was surprising, to say the very least. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to take these things quite so literally. In part as a consequence of that result, the situation at the top of the Premier League is that Chelsea are six points clear, admittedly with a game in hand, while a mere four points covers the next four clubs.</p> <p>In Italy the difference between second and fifth is only five points, but the leaders are 14 points in front. Bayern Munich lead the Bundesliga by 11 points, with a massive 14 covering second to fifth. In Spain a single point separates Barcelona and Real Madrid but 12 points cover second to fifth. In France the figures are two points and seven, in Holland 11 points and 15.</p> <p>Clearly it depends how one measures these things, but surely the English league can hold its head up as sufficiently competitive. Particularly as some of the biggest spending in history has taken place to enable clubs such as Chelsea and Manchester City to become successful.</p> <p>There is a certain amount of schadenfreude involved in contemplating the remote possibility of City failing to finish in the top four, after all that investment, but perhaps there is no need to be quite so negative. It is a triumph of the English league that even insane amounts of money cannot guarantee success. It is certainly a triumph for Burnley, who are not only facing insurmountable odds but having a good go at overcoming them.</p> <p>The national side, that other litmus test of the footballing health of a nation, happen to be in action next week. If England cannot sweep aside Lithuania with the sort of joyous contempt with which Burnley overcame City, then questions need to be asked. What is the England manager\xe2\x80\x99s job if not to coax extraordinary performances from ordinary players? It may be too soon to start a bandwagon rolling for Sean Dyche as Roy Hodgson\xe2\x80\x99s successor, but if he could nip down to Wembley next Friday and just breathe on the players before kick-off the evening could yet turn into one to remember.</p>'
