b'Lukasz Fabianski thankful for Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger\xe2\x80\x99s saving graces at Arsenal'


b'<p>Lukasz Fabianski has poured cold water on one of football\xe2\x80\x99s unwritten rules, namely that the man between the sticks has to be a little bit bonkers. \xe2\x80\x9cI think the idea of crazy goalkeepers is an old thing, really,\xe2\x80\x9d the Swansea City No1 says. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you look at the Premier League, then I don\xe2\x80\x99t see many crazy ones any more.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>No sooner has Fabianski made that comment than it is politely pointed out to the Pole that he may have overlooked Wojciech Szczesny, his larger than life countryman, former Arsenal team-mate and opposite number at the Liberty Stadium on Sunday. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe,\xe2\x80\x9d Fabianski says, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cBut apart from Wojciech, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you look at the big clubs \xe2\x80\x93 Madrid, they have Casillas. Chelsea have Courtois, he\xe2\x80\x99s young but a very calm guy. Before at Man United they had Van der Sar \xe2\x80\x93 very calm. Petr Cech \xe2\x80\x93 he is very calm. So I think maybe the crazy, extraordinary thing is now an old thing. Now, everyone talks about goalkeepers having to give confidence to the team, to give calmness to the back four. It\xe2\x80\x99s stuff like that. So, what am I? I just try and be helpful to the players in every way possible.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Fabianski has brought those qualities and more to Swansea. Signed on a free transfer from Arsenal in the summer, the 29-year-old has taken over from Michel Vorm, who joined Tottenham, and impressed everyone at Swansea with his performances and \xe2\x80\x93 in particular \xe2\x80\x93 his command of the penalty area. Fabianski has kept five clean sheets in 10 Premier League games and has collected more crosses than any other top flight goalkeeper. So much for that cruel \xe2\x80\x9cFlappyhandski\xe2\x80\x9d jibe.</p> <p>Not that Fabianski felt he had anything to prove. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you look at the games I have played since coming back from my last serious injury at Arsenal, I think you can clearly see that I am a different goalie to the one I used to be,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I think it was at that time that I felt I needed to prove something. But not any more.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger admitted on Friday that he wanted to keep Fabianski but the Arsenal manager was powerless when it came to trying to change the mind of a man who could no longer tolerate watching games from the bench. In seven years at Arsenal, Fabianski made only 78 appearances. Last December, he decided enough was enough.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cTowards the end of the season before, I came into the team and played a few games and I think I did well, then I got injured and the summer came and I remember the boss talking with me, saying that he wanted me to compete for that No1 spot. Six months from the summer I was still the second choice. I just said that probably the best option for me would be to leave.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>An affable man, Fabianski talks about \xe2\x80\x9cups and downs\xe2\x80\x9d at Arsenal and expresses frustration that injuries held him back, but there is not a trace of bitterness. As well as feeling a debt of gratitude to Arsenal for giving him the chance to come to England, Fabianski is proud of the fact that he was in goal when the club ended their nine-year wait for a trophy with victory in the FA Cup final over Hull in May.</p> <p>Although Fabianski had played in each of the previous rounds, including saving two spot-kicks in the penalty shootout win over Wigan in the semi-final, Wenger could easily have plumped for Szczesny, his first-choice goalkeeper, in a game of such importance to the manager and Arsenal. Instead the Frenchman stayed loyal to Fabianski.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cFor sure I would have been frustrated if he had dropped me for the final because I think especially the last run in the FA Cup, I was a very important part of the team and I think I deserved the place to play in the final, so it speaks a lot about Wenger and how respectful he was towards me,\xe2\x80\x9d Fabianski says. \xe2\x80\x9cOver the years, I was always training hard, no matter what position I was in. I think I gained respect for that and for always being honest with Wenger. I would say we had a good relationship and a good understanding and I\xe2\x80\x99m very thankful he gave me that opportunity in the final.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>When Fabianski said goodbye to everyone a couple of days later, one of the Arsenal coaching staff had one final try at talking him into staying. Fabianski, however, was convinced that he had to leave Arsenal behind and nothing that has happened since has made him regret that decision.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSwansea has given me what I always wanted,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cFor me, it is a dream come true to play in the Premier League as a No1 goalkeeper.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
