b'<p>ALL THAT GLITTERS ISN\xe2\x80\x99T GOLD</p> <p>Florentino P\xc3\xa9rez woke up this morning, sighed and rubbed his back, wincing as he pressed his fingers into his spine. He still felt tired. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t slept well. He rarely does. Buying a solid gold mattress looked like a good idea at the time, but turns out it isn\xe2\x80\x99t that comfortable. Who knew? The sales assistant had made such a good pitch to him and it looked so nice and expensive and shiny and expensive and shiny and expensive, the other club presidents were going to be so jealous of him once he posted it on Instagram. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait to lie down when he bought it. In fact, he rushed upstairs at 9pm, burst into his bedroom, took a long run-up, leapt off the ground, through the air and landed on the bed. Yaroo! Solid gold is hard. It hurt. Jumping was a bad choice. Enjoyable, though. Not everyone gets to jump on a solid gold mattress, do they? No. No they do not.</p> <p>And not everyone has a duvet made out of solid gold either. Lucky Florentino! What a lucky boy! Admittedly said duvet is pretty unwieldy, due to its inherent metalness, and it can also be quite problematic in the bitter winter months, seeing as it generates absolutely no warmth. Brrrr! Poor Florentino. But he can live with that. What\xe2\x80\x99s really bothering him is that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a mattress made out of solid platinum and a duvet made out of solid platinum and, oh oh oh, a unicorn made out of solid platinum! It\xe2\x80\x99s so unfair. He\xe2\x80\x99s got half a mind to get rid of that silly man who found him all those boring little trinkets, that useless Italian man with the funny eyebrow, then hire someone much more exciting in his place, the bald French guy maybe. Having new stuff is so fun! Especially when that new stuff is people!</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if I will be here next season,\xe2\x80\x9d Carlo Ancelotti said in the wake of Real Madrid\xe2\x80\x99s Big Cup exit at the hands of a Juventus team who looked strangely like a team, whatever that is, probably something losers have to settle for because they don\xe2\x80\x99t have any. \xe2\x80\x9cToday to talk about the future does not make much sense.\xe2\x80\x9d But let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about the future!</p> <p>Clearly, having only spent something in the region of \xc2\xa3569m last summer, the only thing that can take Real to the next level would be signing Marco Reus, Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero and Paul Pogba, before adding that crucial glamorous touch by a few of the cast members from Made in Chelsea to play in defence. It\xe2\x80\x99s not looking good for designated scapegoat, Gareth Bale, although he\xe2\x80\x99s not letting the haters get him down. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t kill me makes me stronger,\xe2\x80\x9d Bale said somewhat hopefully, failing to take into account that a solid gold mattress being lobbed off a balcony and on to his head definitely wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make him stronger.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Tom Bryant from 8.05pm BST for MBM coverage of Dnipro 1-0 Napoli (agg: 2-1). You could even reinvest your winnings from last night.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHad I known that the journalist who slaughtered me would do so, I probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have written any comments on Facebook except about football. Not that I have changed my mind about what I wrote, I still believe the things I wrote\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Torben Aakjaer, who was sacked as a Manchester United scout after this story about his racist Facebook posts, decides to keep digging.</p> RECOMMENDED VIEWING <p>Barry Glendenning plays the man himself at Chris Kamara Street Soccer in the latest Guardian Football meets \xe2\x80\xa6 video.</p>            FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt says a lot for the history of Real Madrid when football\xe2\x80\x99s entire beardy hipster community rejoiced en masse as Him and co slumped to a side who are only marginally less evil. Forza Juve, the newly crowned Big Cup neutrals\xe2\x80\x99 favourite\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Johnny Connelly.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was mildly enjoying The Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive review of Barcelona\xe2\x80\x99s takedown of Bayern Munich until I got to the final paragraph and this particular sentence: \xe2\x80\x98Tonight Barcelona will find out whether Real Madrid or Plucky Little Juventus will be their opponents on 6 June.\xe2\x80\x99 The bloody 6th of June? My own team\xe2\x80\x99s season finished on 2 May. The month of June during a non-World Cup or European Championship should be spent eating at BBQs and swearing at Alastair Cook, not watching Big Cup final. We can\xe2\x80\x99t even STOP FOOTBALL when it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to have stopped any more\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Adrian Foster.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why the women\xe2\x80\x99s game suffers from popularity-knack in comparison to men\xe2\x80\x99s football, but yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Quote of the Day will surely offer comfort to those worried about making the transition. Looking for familiar signs to help you settle in? Fear not. One of Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s star players needs surgery on an ankle and Sunderland\xe2\x80\x99s defenders are \xe2\x80\x98clearly not good enough to be playing at this level\xe2\x80\x99.
