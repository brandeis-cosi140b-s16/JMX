b'Arsenal v Swansea: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened | Jacob Steinberg'


b'<p>Well, it was a fairly dire game at times, but we were treated to a rousing finish thanks to Bafetimbi Gomis\xe2\x80\x99s late winner for Swansea, who are now a point behind Southampton and two behind Tottenham. Suddenly the Europa League looks like a very real possibility for Garry Monk\xe2\x80\x99s side, whose final two games are at home to Manchester City and away to Crystal Palace. As for Arsenal, they only have themselves to blame. The first half was a waste and they squandered a couple of great chances in the second half, before succumbing to that sucker punch from Gomis. They are two points above Manchester United and go to Old Trafford on Sunday afternoon. There\xe2\x80\x99s still some work to be done if they\xe2\x80\x99re going to avoid finishing fourth again. Thanks for reading and emailing tonight. It\xe2\x80\x99s been very weird and you\xe2\x80\x99ve been very amusing company. Good night.</p>     Arsenal dejected after Swansea\xe2\x80\x99s goal.
