b'Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez: Manchester United will thrive under Louis van Gaal'


b'<p>Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez believes Manchester United will challenge for the Premier League title next season having rediscovered \xe2\x80\x9cthe right formula\xe2\x80\x9d under Louis van Gaal.</p> <p>Everton host United on Sunday almost exactly a year after David Moyes returned to his former club for what proved to be his final game in charge of the then reigning Premier League champions. Twelve months on United arrive at Goodison Park on a fine run of form, despite last weekend\xe2\x80\x99s defeat at Chelsea, and seeking to strengthen their claims on the final automatic qualifying place for the Champions League.</p> <p>The Everton manager, whose team have pulled away from relegation danger with four wins in their last five matches, claims Van Gaal will oversee further improvement at Old Trafford next season.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t easy to find the right formula at Manchester United after Sir Alex Ferguson retired,\xe2\x80\x9d Mart\xc3\xadnez said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think what has been really interesting is how long it took to find the right formula but how competitive the team was all through that period.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we faced them at Old Trafford in October, if someone had said they would be favourites to finish above the champions, Manchester City, this season, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you would have believed it. That shows you the incredible turnaround. I do think United will finish strong this season and they are capable of challenging for everything next season.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
