b'Barcelona v PSG: Champions League quarter-final \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>Paul Griffin writes ... \xe2\x80\x9cThese philistines who criticise Luiz don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the subtleties of the modern game,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cJust as the great Hungary team invented the false nine, a centre forward whose whereabouts was never clear, Luiz has introduced the world to the false six, a centre half whose position remains a complete mystery. Only the cognoscenti, not the arrivistes, understand this.\xe2\x80\x9d Thanks for your time and your emails, join me tomorrow evening for some more hot and sweaty Champions League action. </p>'
