b'Wayne Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s play for Manchester United is key, not the captaincy role | Paul Wilson'


b'<p>Wayne Rooney these days is a player who sharply divides opinion, so the not entirely unexpected news of his elevation to the Manchester United captaincy \xe2\x80\x93 Louis van Gaal was always going to be too savvy to hand it to fellow Dutchman Robin van Persie \xe2\x80\x93 has inevitably produced a mixed reaction.</p> <p>On the one hand are people saying he deserves it based on age and experience and imploring Roy Hodgson to do the same for England. Others greeted the announcement with a more cynical view, along the lines of: serial transfer requester and pay rise expert backs United into another corner. If the Old Trafford captaincy is an honour, as Rooney insists it is, even some of United\xe2\x80\x99s most faithful followers will be uncomfortable with it being bestowed on a player who this time last year was being accused of disloyalty to the club.</p> <p>The upshot of the proposed move to Chelsea that never came about, however, is what left Van Gaal with a tricky decision to make in quite a short time.</p> <p>David Moyes\xe2\x80\x99 appeasement of Rooney meant the player ended up with a long contract and \xc2\xa3300,000 per week. How is a new manager supposed to handle such a prized asset? Privately Van Gaal may well share the common view that Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s best years are behind him and that the club should have sold while an offer was on the table, but that is not the situation he has inherited.</p> <p>Rooney must be accommodated somehow, his wages and talismanic status demand it, and the most sensible course for a new manager to choose is to give him the chance to show his worth.</p> <p>Rooney has, of course, already proved his worth to United many times in the last decade, but what he needs to do now is prove he is worth his present contract. This is a player who ended up being squeezed out of Sir Alex Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s big match line-ups, his position as an ever-present under threat two years ago, and though Moyes bent over backwards to redress that situation and build his attack around Rooney, no one at United could describe last season as an unqualified success.</p> <p>For a pragmatist such as Van Gaal, the initial issue is quite simple.</p> <p>Rooney must play, because a new manager cannot come in and simply discard a club\xe2\x80\x99s highest paid performer without seeing enough games to form an opinion. Realistically United are probably stuck with the player anyway, since there would be few offers to match his present wages. As long as Rooney plays, the captaincy becomes something of a side issue. Why not give it to the club\xe2\x80\x99s longest-serving and most experienced player? That is what most clubs do. If Rooney plays, as long as he is not stuck out on the left wing again, he is likely to be happy and will probably make quite a good captain. He may still be prone to the odd flashes of temper, even while wearing the armband, though he would hardly be the first United captain in recent memory to walk that tightrope. At his best, Rooney is an inspirational figure and a respected player, so given that Van Persie might not have been the most diplomatic choice for an incoming Dutch coach, Van Gaal has probably done the right thing for now.</p> <p>The problem will arise in the future if, and it still is an if rather than a when, Van Gaal forms the same conclusion as Ferguson and decides Rooney is not as dynamic as he used to be and no longer warrants automatic selection. The formations the new manager is talking about: 3-4-1-2 or 5-2-1-2, appear to suit the players he has at his disposal, with Juan Mata operating in the hole and Rooney and Van Persie ahead of him. Yet that system has no use for Danny Welbeck, who along with Shinji Kagawa and Javier Hern\xc3\xa1ndez would be restricted to appearances from the bench, and although circumstances were often difficult last season, it has yet to be established that Rooney and Van Persie can hit it off as an attacking partnership. Rooney\xe2\x80\x99s suitability as a captain is not really in doubt, it is his playing contribution that is open to question, and has been for the last couple of seasons.</p> <p>As long as Rooney is performing well, everything else will fall into place.</p> <p>If he struggles to recapture his old vitality, or manifestly fails to form a working relationship with Van Persie, Van Gaal will have another tricky decision to make.</p> <p>Yet too much is always read into the importance of captains in football. It is not cricket, no calculations or complex decisions are required, it is more of a ceremonial role. Any player with sufficient experience and the respect of his peers could carry out the task, and one suspects Van Gaal is not the sort of coach to hold a rigid or sentimental view of the captaincy. In that respect club football is slightly easier than international football, where dropping a captain is tantamount to announcing the end of his international career. Steven Gerrard has just saved Hodgson a difficult call by bringing the curtain down on his England career himself, not that the England manager showed any sign of noticing the Liverpool player was being bypassed at the top level.</p> <p>Just like Kevin Keegan with Alan Shearer \xe2\x80\x93 who also had to retire to stop getting picked for England when he was past his best \xe2\x80\x93 Hodgson had shown every sign of being willing to keep selecting Gerrard for ever. Now Hodgson must find a new captain, and Rooney is in the frame. If he is in any way re-energised by wearing the armband at United, Van Gaal will have done England a favour, and not merely by finding a new captain. It is a new Rooney, or perhaps a more faithful rendition of the old one, that everyone wants to see.</p>'
