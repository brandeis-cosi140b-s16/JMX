b'<p>Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s Manchester City future is in the balance after he stated he is open to \xe2\x80\x9cnew challenges\xe2\x80\x9d, although there is no certainty the midfielder will leave the champions in the close season. He also described Paris Saint-Germain as \xe2\x80\x9ca great club\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Tour\xc3\xa9 has had an uneven campaign for City but he was among the best performers in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 2-0 win over West Ham United at the Etihad Stadium. The 31-year-old, who has two years left on his contract, insists money does not concern him but being challenged does.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSince I started playing football, I had a dream as a little boy. Today, I am living the dream of thousands of little boys. I represent my continent, Africa, and that has no price. No amount of wages will make me stay at a club if I feel that I no longer belong there or if no challenge exists for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Foot Mercato.</p>  <p> Related: Wolfsburg\xe2\x80\x99s Kevin De Bruyne still open to Manchester City move, says agent </p>   <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt would be unjust on my part. There comes a moment where numbers don\xe2\x80\x99t stop us, it goes beyond that, even if the English press seem more interested in the numbers than the sport itself. For the future, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know more than you do because I will always go where I am offered new challenges. That is in my nature.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>PSG are potential suitors, with Tour\xc3\xa9 stating in an interview with a French radio station last year that \xe2\x80\x9cyou never close the door to a big club.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>He said: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the past I have given my opinion on PSG, which went on to inspire a lot of your journalist colleagues. PSG is a great club that has not finished growing and also a big club where any great player can find a place for themselves and make a contribution.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Tour\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s Ivory Coast team-mate, Serge Aurier, who plays for PSG on loan from Toulouse, also revealed they had spoken about the club. \xe2\x80\x9cWe talked a little bit,\xe2\x80\x9d the right-back said. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one can refuse Paris. He is tempted by Paris but I don\xe2\x80\x99t do the negotiations. After discussing with him, he sees himself at Paris one day.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Tour\xc3\xa9 has been singled out as the cause of City\xe2\x80\x99s failings this season. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen things are not necessarily going well in a club, the key players take the fall,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not the only one to have been attacked, even if there is tendency to be harsher with me. Football is my passion, my job and that gives me two good reasons to do as well as I can. I accept criticism if it helps me to improve and I ignore it when the aim is simply to break me.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I arrived at City, [Manuel] Pellegrini was not the coach. Just like the players, managers arrive and leave. As I have said before, I owe it to the City fans to fight just until the end of my career at this club, just as much as I owe it to myself and my continent. My decisions will not be affected by changes in management but more by the challenges that will be offered to me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Roberto Mancini, Internazionale\xe2\x80\x99s coach and his former City manager, would also like to sign Tour\xc3\xa9. \xe2\x80\x9cMancini is a mentor for me, he is a special coach,\xe2\x80\x9d the midfielder said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is no secret that I loved the time when he was boss here, like I love playing for City today.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The agent of Kevin De Bruyne, a summer target for City, has said the Belgium midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s future remains undecided, despite reports he is likely to join Bayern Munich for about \xc2\xa345m with PSG also retaining an interest. Patrick De Koster, his representative, said: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are no formal discussions. In the next few weeks I will be going around the world to talk about the situation with Kevin but this is just informal information.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI will talk to everybody but Kevin is very happy with Wolfsburg and the way they have treated him since he arrived from Chelsea last year. There are still five games to play and hopefully they can make sure of a place in the Champions League next season, so it is a little bit too early to be making any decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>De Koster denied any contact from Manchester United. \xe2\x80\x9cI have met the people from Manchester City and we know each other,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never spoken to anyone from Manchester United.\xe2\x80\x9d Asked how much it may cost to sign De Bruyne, De Koster added: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Wolfsburg paid \xe2\x82\xac24m to Chelsea, so I can see it being a lot more than that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
