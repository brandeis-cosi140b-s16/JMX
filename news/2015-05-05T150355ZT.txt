b'The Fiver | If John Carver is able to survive the cull, pretty much anyone can'


b'<p>RAMS AND BULLDOZERS</p> <p>Bank holidays are all good and well, but the return to the world of work after an extra day of freedom is always psychologically taxing. And so it was that last night The Fiver suffered an anxiety dream, in which it held a big whip in one hand and the steering wheel of a bulldozer in the other. Wheeling around the country at noteworthy velocity and with a glazed look in the eye, The Fiver systematically drove each and every member of Great Britain\xe2\x80\x99s managerial class, whether inert, ineffective or simply inept, into the cold, choppy sea. Britain was thus left with a working population of 173, and a very efficient country it became too. GDP went through the roof. The Fiver then awoke with a jolt, just as it was being led to a show-trial in The Hague. Not sure what our subconscious was trying to say there, but the Fiver won\xe2\x80\x99t wolf down a dozen Dairylea fritters before bedtime ever again, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a piece of processed triangular information you can have for free.</p> <p>Imagine The Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s horror, then, upon finding out that a similar managerial cull looks like occurring in the real world! Because it appears many distinguished football managers are currently under attack, left, right and centre. There\xe2\x80\x99s Carlo Ancelotti, the current champion manager of All Europe and yet one stroke of Andrea Pirlo\xe2\x80\x99s genius away from losing his job at Real Madrid. Brendan Rodgers meanwhile is under bombardment, the subject of an aerial campaign launched by erstwhile LWT executives, if that gauche World of Sport pastiche flying over Anfield on Saturday was anything to go by. And then there\xe2\x80\x99s the travails of poor old John Carver. Ah, the travails of poor old John Carver.</p> <p>Carver has been in charge of Newcastle United since the tail-end of January, since when he\xe2\x80\x99s led the team to 835 straight defeats. A couple more of those, and that\xe2\x80\x99ll be the club record gone. And it\xe2\x80\x99d probably mean relegation, too, which might explain Carver\xe2\x80\x99s spectacular unravelling at the weekend after the Leicester debacle, when he accused Mike Williamson of being deliberately bad at football, it being preferable that rank ineptitude flowers quite organically. Such seemingly minor semantic distinctions actually matter a great deal in the honour-bound environment of the dressing room, and so Carver\xe2\x80\x99s unconscionable salvo needlessly ratcheted up a situation of common-or-garden struggle, turning it into a full-blown, unmanageable farce. Which, if nothing else, shows Carver fully understands what Newcastle United is all about.</p> <p>Usually this sort of incompetent carry-on would get a manager driven into the Tyne by someone atop a runaway heavy-duty construction vehicle \xe2\x80\x93 The Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s also available for weddings and bar mitzvahs \xe2\x80\x93 or at the very least sacked. However Carver has somehow managed to get away with it, being given a third vote of confidence by the Newcastle board, who issued a pre-relegation statement which set out how \xe2\x80\x9cJohn, his staff and players are focused on the three fixtures that remain this season\xe2\x80\x9d. Mind you, it transpires that this announcement was only released after Steve McClaren turned the job down, Newcastle having witnessed Derby County\xe2\x80\x99s astonishing promotion bottle job in the Championship, two wins from their last 13, and deciding the former England manager fitted their profile like a glove. But Carver lives to fight another day, and even if he achieves nothing else, will give all the other under-fire managers out there, from Madrid to Liverpool, some much-needed hope. After all, if Carver is able to survive the cull, pretty much anyone can.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Scott Murray from 7.45pm BST for MBM coverage of Juventus 1-1 Real Madrid.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf you spend your hard-earned money on a match ticket, it\xe2\x80\x99s an insult to witness passionless, mercenary football. Our family is Newcastle. Give us what we want. But, if he is not prepared to change, Heavenly Father, give him the insight to know it\xe2\x80\x99s time to go. Give us a new owner (or a new mentality for the present owner) who will take our spirit and not crush it but revive it. Give us someone who will not rename our stadium from St James\xe2\x80\x99 Park, not change the colour of our strip. Not rebrand us into something we are not\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Newcastle-supporting priest Stephen Foster\xe2\x80\x99s prayer, calling on God to oust Mike Ashley. Amen and good luck with that one.</p> RECOMMENDED LISTENING <p>Get your ears around the latest Football Weekly podcast, with AC Jimbo, Raf Honigstein, John Ashdown and Ian McCourt.</p>      FIVER LETTERS <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI was amused to note the contents of my five-year-old son\xe2\x80\x99s Fisher Price travel football set. The set includes one ball, two players (wearing different kits, indicating that they are on opposing teams), one goal (with an optional piece of cardboard if you want to make things a bit tricky) and three officials \xe2\x80\x93 a ref and two assistants. Both linesmen have a flag (although quite how anyone could be offside in this set up is beyond me) and the ref has both red and yellow cards. I got to wondering what sort of child would revel in such heavy-handed officialdom? Perhaps this is a kit for the 1,057 instead?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Steve Hill.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSo the Football League appears to have made a smart move in leaving the Blackpool v Huddersfield game unplayed, stating that it would have no impact on the relegation/promotion battles. The last time Championship Manager \xe2\x80\x98lost\xe2\x80\x99 a game like that, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow me to progress to the next season, thus STOPPING me from playing FOOTBALL. Clearly the Football League is onboard with The Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s STOP FOOTBALL campaign\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Laoi Primorac \xc3\x93 Murch\xc3\xba. </p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d just like to be one of 666 pedants to point out that, just because it\xe2\x80\x99s German death metal, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it\xe2\x80\x99s extreme (Friday\xe2\x80\x99s Bits and Bobs). Of the many death metal sub-genres, there are many like p0rnogrind which are musically far from extreme. Although, given p0rnogrind\xe2\x80\x99s chief exponent \xe2\x80\x93 Germany\xe2\x80\x99s Gut \xe2\x80\x93 released work on the Malodorous Mangled Innards and Regurgitated Semen imprints, on second thoughts you may have a point\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Tom Bryant, Big Website (and no others).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps Martyn Wilson (Friday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters), as a Leicester City supporter, has a less-than-objective view on his team\xe2\x80\x99s manager? In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the press which perceives Nigel Pearson as a paranoid bully in need of anger management, it\xe2\x80\x99s the majority of football fans outside of Leicester. In fact, that opinion is not just limited to football fans. My wife, who has no idea who he is, watched one of his monosyllabic, and rather intimidating, interviews on MOTD recently and commented: \xe2\x80\x98That man is a bully if ever I saw one.\xe2\x80\x99 She is a very good judge of character, which is why she married me\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Chris Draper.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\xa2 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
