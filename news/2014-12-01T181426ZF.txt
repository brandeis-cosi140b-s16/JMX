b'Chelsea  <p>Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has described Uefa\xe2\x80\x99s financial fair play rules as a contradiction which allow Europe\xe2\x80\x99s elite clubs to maintain the status quo.</p> <p>Chelsea spent almost \xc2\xa395m in the summer on signings including Diego Costa and Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas but were able to post an overall profit after selling David Luiz, Romelu Lukaku and Demba Ba. In contrast, Real Madrid spent almost \xc2\xa3100m on players, while Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s spending almost broke the \xc2\xa3150m barrier.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI think financial fair play is a contradiction because when football decided to go for financial fair play it was exactly to put teams in equal conditions to compete,\xe2\x80\x9d the Chelsea manager told Yahoo.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut what happened really with financial fair play is a big protection to the historical, old, big clubs, which have a financial structure, a commercial structure, everything in place based on historical success for years and years and years.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the \xe2\x80\x98new\xe2\x80\x99 clubs \xe2\x80\x93 I call them \xe2\x80\x98new\xe2\x80\x99 clubs, those with new investment \xe2\x80\x93 they cannot put themselves quickly at the same level.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Tottenham Hotspur  <p>Three men have been charged over a pitch invasion stunt which caused a Spur match to be temporarily suspended.</p> <p>Nathaniel Thompson, 23, Helder Gomes, 22, and Daniel Jarvis, 26, were arrested after the bizarre scenes during the club\xe2\x80\x99s Europa League match against Partizan Belgrade on Thursday and have been charged with pitch invasion.</p> <p>They have been bailed and will appear at a magistrates court in north London on 18 December.</p> <p>Jarvis was bailed to attend a police station in early January in relation to his arrest for handling stolen goods, police said. Tottenham were charged by Uefa over the incidents.</p> New York Red Bulls  <p>Thierry Henry has confirmed he has played his final game for the New York Red Bulls. New England Revolution ended the Red Bulls\xe2\x80\x99 play-off run on Saturday and Henry said he had decided not to return for another season.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe decision has always been that I would leave after the duration of my contract and, although that was never going to change, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want it to distract from the progress of the team,\xe2\x80\x9d the 37-year-old said.</p> <p>There has been speculation regarding Henry rejoining Arsenal in a player-coach role. \xe2\x80\x9cI will now take the next few weeks to reflect and decide on the next chapter,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.</p> Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or <p>Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Manuel Neuer have been shortlisted for Fifa\xe2\x80\x99s Ballon d\xe2\x80\x99Or award. Ronaldo is the favourite to retain the title after winning the Champions League in May and having scored 20 goals in 12 league games for Real Madrid this season.</p> <p>Neuer would become the second goalkeeper to win the award, following Lev Yashin in 1963.</p> <p>The award will be presented in Zurich on 12 January.</p> Premier League <p>Mike Jones has been handed fourth official duty for Aston Villa\xe2\x80\x99s match against Leicester on Sunday after his testing afternoon in Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s 3-0 victory at Southampton. The referee booked City\xe2\x80\x99s Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero for diving, despite the striker being clearly upended by Jos\xc3\xa9 Fonte. Jones will referee West Brom\xe2\x80\x99s game against West Ham on Tuesday night, an assignment made before Sunday.</p>'
