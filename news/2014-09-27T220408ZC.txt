b'Championship roundup: Kit Symons restates his case after Fulham\xe2\x80\x99s first win'


b'Birmingham City 1-2 Fulham <p>Caretaker Kit Symons restated his desire to replace Felix Magath on a full-time basis after securing Fulham\xe2\x80\x99s first win of the season. \xe2\x80\x9cI have made it clear from day one. This is the job I\xe2\x80\x99ve always wanted to do, to be manager of Fulham. In no uncertain terms everyone knows that this is exactly what I want to do. I love the club, I want the right person to be in charge of Fulham, and I want that right person to be me.\xe2\x80\x9d Birmingham manager Lee Clark said: \xe2\x80\x9cGive him the job. He has the fans behind him and he has people around the club smiling again. It\xe2\x80\x99s a special club, and he knows it \xe2\x80\x93 they don\xe2\x80\x99t need an outsider.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Bolton Wanderers 0-2 Derby County <p>Dougie Freedman said he has no plan to walk away despite Bolton\xe2\x80\x99s crowd turning on him after defeat left them in the relegation zone. \xe2\x80\x9cI tried to out-football Derby and I got it horribly wrong. But you cannot legislate for us playing football suicide. I fully understand the fans\xe2\x80\x99 opinions \xe2\x80\x93 this job is proving more difficult than I ever thought it would be \xe2\x80\x93 but I\xe2\x80\x99m not hiding away from it and I will make the tough decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d Steve McClaren backed Freedman: \xe2\x80\x9cYou live and die by results. But Bolton were unlucky at Wolves last week, were terrific at Chelsea in midweek and today we played very well.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> Cardiff City 2-1 Sheffield Wednesday <p>Scott Young said he and fellow caretaker Danny Gabbidon can be proud if this win over Wednesday turns out to be their last game in charge. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad record really. We\xe2\x80\x99re unbeaten in the league, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve taken four points out of six. We have enjoyed every minute of it and we will have conversations with the owner and the chairman and see where we go from here.\xe2\x80\x9d Stuart Gray was frustrated by his side letting a chance to continue their unbeaten away record slip. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen it went to 1-1 I thought there was only one team that could win it. But we didn\xe2\x80\x99t defend out 18-yard box properly.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> And the rest <p>Blackburn came from two goals down to earn a point against Watford, the equaliser coming from Ryan Tunnicliffe. \xe2\x96\xa0 Bournemouth secured a deserved 2-0 home win over Wigan. \xe2\x96\xa0 Ten-man Middlesbrough held on for a point in a 0-0 draw at Charlton. \xe2\x96\xa0 Nahki Wells struck twice as Chris Powell secured his first win as Huddersfield manager, 2-1 against Millwall. \xe2\x96\xa0 Ipswich scored twice in the first six minutes to beat Rotherham 2-0. \xe2\x96\xa0 And Forest lost their place at the top after being held to a 0-0 home draw by Brighton.</p>'
