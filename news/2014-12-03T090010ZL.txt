b'Leandro Cast\xc3\xa1n\xe2\x80\x99s imminent brain surgery weighs heavy on Roma minds'


b'<p>Roma\xe2\x80\x99s players were buoyant. Outpassed and outplayed against Empoli in mid-September, the players jogged down the tunnel for their half-time team talk with a smile on their faces, 1-0 up, having taken the lead through a lucky own goal.</p> <p>All except one. Leandro Cast\xc3\xa1n had felt increasingly disorientated as the game had progressed and after admitting to Roma\xe2\x80\x99s medical staff that he was suffering waves of acute dizziness, the tough-tackling centre-back was withdrawn at half-time. Subsequent tests \xe2\x80\x93 the results of which were announced last month \xe2\x80\x93 revealed the Brazilian international had developed abnormal swelling of blood vessels on the brain, called a cavernoma. Cast\xc3\xa1n was admitted to a hospital in Rome on Tuesday night and he will be operated on by renowned neurosurgeon Giulio Maira on Wednesday to relieve the pressure on his brain.</p> <p>One of the most popular members of the Roma squad and regarded as one of the best defenders in Serie A, Cast\xc3\xa1n was ever-present in a defence that conceded only 25 goals in 38 appearances last season and was linked with a move to Chelsea before signing a contract extension to 2018 in May. In a footballing sense, his absence has been sorely felt \xe2\x80\x93 Roma have conceded 21 goals in 16 matches since that September day in Empoli.</p> <p>However, as is always the case with an injury of this type, the importance of sport has to be put into perspective \xe2\x80\x93 a reminder that football is just a game. Whilst the existing cavernoma does not represent a threat to Cast\xc3\xa1n\xe2\x80\x99s life, without surgery he is at risk of reoccurrences that could end his playing career.</p> <p>Ian Stuart, founder of Cavernoma Alliance UK, told the Guardian: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a life-threatening condition on the whole, but it can be, depending on the size and of the bleed, the skill of the surgeon and a great deal of luck. It can happen to anyone. Medical professionals think it is especially appropriate for people under stress, sports people in particular.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>There are a handful of sports stars who have suffered a similar condition, with varying degrees of fortune. The cyclist Alberto Contador suffered a horrific crash in May 2004, losing consciousness on his bike, which was attributed to a cavernoma. Contador thankfully came through the surgery, was walking again by August and back on his bike by December of that year. Riding with more than 100 stitches in his head, the Spaniard has since reached the pinnacle of his sport.</p> <p>Not all have been so fortunate. Boston Red Sox\xe2\x80\x99s Ryan Westmoreland was regarded as one of the brightest prospects in baseball when he was diagnosed with a cavernoma in 2010 and after twice undergoing brain surgery, Westmoreland was forced to retire from the game in 2013 at the age of 22.</p> <p>Marco Zanchi, a former Italy Under-21 international who played for Juventus and Udinese, was diagnosed with a cavernoma in 2003. \xe2\x80\x9cI had the operation in April and I returned to the field in October that same year,\xe2\x80\x9d 37-year-old Zanchi told ANSA. \xe2\x80\x9cAlready a week after the operation, I felt fine. Clearly the skull has to heal, so that takes around three or four months. In my view, Cast\xc3\xa1n could be back playing again in April.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The overriding point to take from these examples is that each individual case is different and that many factors \xe2\x80\x93 including the size and location of the cavernoma or complications in surgery \xe2\x80\x93 have an effect on the speed or extent of a patient\xe2\x80\x99s recovery. It must be emphasised that since his diagnosis, Cast\xc3\xa1n has remained in good health and even maintained a training schedule with the club so certainly looks well equipped to make a full recovery.</p> <p>What is both heartening and reassuring is the reaction from Roma, who have placed no pressure on a return date. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter his surgery, he will return to being a Roma player. We will wait for him. But now we must leave him alone,\xe2\x80\x9d manager Rudi Garc\xc3\xada said recently.</p> <p>The Roma fans have also had their say, and in the buildup to the surgery this week it is arguably their words that are the most poignant. During Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 4-2 win over Internazionale, a huge banner was unfurled by ultras in the Stadio Olympico that read \xe2\x80\x9cDai Cast\xc3\xa1n vinci anche questo tackle!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 translated as \xe2\x80\x9cCome on Cast\xc3\xa1n, win this tackle as well!\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
