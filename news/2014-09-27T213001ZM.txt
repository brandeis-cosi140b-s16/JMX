b'Marvin Sordell says Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s collective will is their greatest weapon'


b'<p>Ryan Giggs made his Manchester United debut the year Marvin Sordell was born. The Burnley striker idolised Giggs to an almost unhealthy degree in his formative years \xe2\x80\x93 \xe2\x80\x9cI grew up watching him tearing up the Premier League\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 and still finds it amazing that their careers coincided just enough to permit a fleeting opportunity to play in the same team.</p> <p>That was at the Olympics two years ago and Sordell, now 23, still has the shirt as a souvenir. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve kept everything,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve kept the athletes pass, the letter that said I\xe2\x80\x99d been picked, even the strange-looking outfit we wore for the opening ceremony. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the video of the opening ceremony on my phone and I still look at it. But my most prized possessions are two Olympic shirts. The one that I wore and another signed by Ryan Giggs.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe Olympics is as big as it gets but I have only realised that since. At the time it was a whirlwind, chaos. It\xe2\x80\x99s what dreams are made of. But so is being selected for England Under-21s and finally getting to play in the Premier League. Sometimes when I feel a bit down or disappointed over something I have to give myself a slap in the face and picture where I was seven years ago. You have to get a sense of perspective, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not done too bad.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Seven years ago Sordell was getting over the pain of rejection, first by Chelsea, then by Fulham. It began to look as though his dream of becoming a professional footballer might not come to fruition but that did not mean he was ready to give up on it. Even though he was in the middle of his GCSEs he set off with his mother on the exit trial circuit, the last chance saloon for youth players released by their clubs where make-or-break matches are staged before an audience comprised almost entirely of scouts from lower down the league. \xe2\x80\x9cI have to thank my Mum,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t give up on me, she drove me up and down the country armed with just an A-Z. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a satnav. It was worth it, though, there was a fair amount of interest, and that\xe2\x80\x99s how I ended up signing for Watford.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Sordell would be at Watford for the next five years, not only making a name for himself but forging a relationship with Sean Dyche so that, when a \xc2\xa33m move to Bolton did not quite work out to either party\xe2\x80\x99s satisfaction, it was an easy decision to move a few miles further north to work for a manager he knew well \xe2\x80\x93 especially as Burnley had just been promoted to the Premier League.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt was quite a big event for me and my family when I played my first Premier League game,\xe2\x80\x9d Sordell says. \xe2\x80\x9cYou need a lot of self-belief when you keep being rejected, and I had that. But my family and friends were very supportive as well. One person can\xe2\x80\x99t conquer the world, you need a good group of people around you.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>That is what Sordell believes Burnley have going for them. Dyche specialises in team-building, not just putting names on a list but forging a strong group identity, a collective where everyone knows and accepts his own responsibility. \xe2\x80\x9cHe creates an environment where everyone is singing from the same song-sheet,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen everyone is working towards the same goal it makes it easy to fit in.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>While Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s solid, if unspectacular, start will have pleased Dyche up to a point, everyone knows the next step is to gain three points. Burnley travel to West Bromwich on Sunday looking for their first win, after picking up three points from three goalless draws.</p> <p>Sordell, in the side for the injured Danny Ings, feels a goal and maybe a win could be just around the next corner. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s coming,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is one of the toughest leagues in the world and chances are harder to come by but we are getting opportunities and we are getting closer.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
