b'Everton forget their domestic slumber to keep European dream alive | Paul Wilson'


b'<p>Pristine is the word Roberto Mart\xc3\xadnez selects to describe Everton\xe2\x80\x99s progress in Europe this season, not an adjective that could be applied to their struggles in the Premier League.</p> <p>Why there should be such a discrepancy in results is perplexing everyone at the club according to Phil Jagielka, the Everton captain, though key to the impressive performances in Europe has been the goalscoring form of Romelu Lukaku. The former Chelsea striker now has seven goals in eight Europa League appearances, the same number he has managed in 28 games in the Premier League.</p> <p>This was the biggest test to date, against an accomplished side unbeaten in the Ukrainian league and, despite their manager\xe2\x80\x99s assurances that Everton had a squad big enough to tackle both challenges and that there could be no question of prioritising the Premier League, the home side initially looked timed and unadventurous. Everton moved the ball around efficiently enough, but Kyiv had players who could go one stage further and beat opponents with the ball at their feet.</p> <p>Oleh Gusev and Andriy Yarmolenko had already given warnings of their ability on the flanks before they combined for the opening goal. That might have come from a set piece, but there was something ominous about the speed with which Kyiv moved to put pressure on the Everton goal after Antol\xc3\xadn Alcaraz had inadvertently given possession away with a misdirected header a few yards into the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 half. Yarmolenko played his part in winning the corner and Everton were still in disarray when he delivered it, Gusev coming across from the right wing to meet it at the angle of the six-yard area and clip the ball past Tim Howard.</p> <p>It was not the start Everton wanted, and with Lukaku still struggling to get into the game, the question was how Everton would respond. They reacted with some of the fight and determination that has been missing from their domestic slumber. After struggling to get out of their own half for the first half hour they suddenly burst into life along with their supporters. Lukaku finally managed to outstrip Danilo Silva and find some space to give his side some encouragement but, though he did the right thing in trying to find Ross Barkley in the middle, his rather telegraphed pass was intercepted by Domagoj Vida.</p> <p>Towards the end of the first half, Lukaku was at least making his presence felt and causing the visitors a few problems, though the closest he came to scoring was a comical contest with the Kyiv goalkeeper for a ball pumped forward into an empty half of the pitch. Oleksandr Shovkovskiy won the race but fluffed his clearing kick, giving Lukaku the opportunity to collect the ball and take a shy at an unguarded goal.</p> <p>He missed on that occasion, but with the Everton crowd urging their favourites to ditch the cautious passing and have a go at their opponents the home side had made a game of it by the interval and Lukaku was right at the heart of the recovery. First he brought a fingertip save from Shovkovskiy with a thunderous drive from a free-kick, forcing a corner from which Jagielka saw a header cleared off the line. Then, with the Kyiv defence still reeling and Goodison baying for more, Lukaku constructed an equaliser for Steven Naismith with sheer brute strength, riding three challenges and slipping the ball out of a fourth to leave the Scot a clear sight of goal.</p> <p>Kyiv were clearly rattled, as much by Everton\xe2\x80\x99s strength of character as Lukaku\xe2\x80\x99s muscle, and defended more doggedly in the first 10 minutes of the second half than they had been required to do in the whole of the first. Lukaku won a corner from which Naismith almost stole in for a second then, after the ridiculously confident Luke Garbutt brought a save from Shovkovskiy with a venomous free-kick, Lukaku could not quite get the close-range touch he needed when Naismith played him in.</p> <p>What was noticeable, especially when Jagielka carried the ball out of defence with a dribble round Vida on the left touchline, was that Everton were now showing all the confidence and swagger, with Naismith and Lukaku beginning to find each other with ease. With the winner from the penalty spot, Lukaku became Everton\xe2\x80\x99s leading European goalscorer, no less. Everton will have to do it all again in Kiev and, without the Goodison effect that could be a tall order, though where there is Lukaku there is hope.</p> <p>Assuming Everton play to their strengths and go for the jugular again, and do not attempt to sit on their lead, the Dynamo defenders can expect another pummelling.</p>'
