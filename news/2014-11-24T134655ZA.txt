b'<p>Alisher Usmanov, Arsenal\xe2\x80\x99s second largest shareholder after Stan Kroenke, has accused Ars\xc3\xa8ne Wenger of failing to learn from his mistakes and claims the club must strengthen every area of the team to compete with Europe\xe2\x80\x99s elite.</p> <p>The Russian billionaire stressed his desire to see Wenger reintroduce success at Arsenal but expressed his concerns that the Frenchman\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprinciples\xe2\x80\x9d could be holding the side back following another defeat at the hands of Manchester United that continued a miserable recent record against the Premier League\xe2\x80\x99s strongest sides.</p> <p>Speaking to CNBC, Usmanov said: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is one of the greatest coaches, not just of European, but of world football. But we have a Russian proverb which goes: \xe2\x80\x9cEven an old lady can have a roof falling on her.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody makes mistakes. He can make mistakes and I know as you age it is more difficult, more challenging to accept one\xe2\x80\x99s mistakes. Does [Wenger] have money or not? There is officially money in the club.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cArsenal is a dream that sometimes becomes a mirage and sometimes a pain as every dream. [The] potential of the team is there but there is no critical evaluation of mistakes and they need to need to acknowledge them. Because no genius can retain the same level of genius if they do not acknowledge mistakes. It\xe2\x80\x99s only when you admit your mistakes that you can get rid of them.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy opinion \xe2\x80\x93 and I tell it openly \xe2\x80\x93 we need to strengthen every position to play on the level of such teams in [the] UK as Chelsea and Manchester City, in Europe like Real Madrid, Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and other clubs.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The 2-1 defeat to United left Arsenal in eighth place in the Premier League with four wins from 12 matches \xe2\x80\x93 their worst start to a season since the 1982-83 \xe2\x80\x93 and prompted Wenger to label his side \xe2\x80\x9cdefensively naive\xe2\x80\x9d.</p>'
