b'Slack attitudes at Manchester City risk returning club to tragicomedy | Jacob Steinberg'


b'<p>A school of thought exists that whenever Manchester City have a slump in form their supporters are secretly glad to be reminded of the days before their club was a superpower and they would be forced to watch through their fingers as the likes of Jamie Pollock and Lee Bradbury lurched from one farce to the next.</p> <p>City\xe2\x80\x99s potential for tragicomedy was unrivalled back then and surely their supporters are able to look back and have a wry chuckle at the various humiliations their team subjected them to before the money came rolling in. Yet it is not supposed to happen now. The modern City are supposed to have shed the Typical City identity and it should not be the case that it is still possible to detect a strain of what Joe Royle labelled Cityitis all those years ago.</p> <p>As the evidence this season proves, City have not quite got it out of their system. When they won the league in 2012, they followed it up with the lamest title defence imaginable, which resulted in Roberto Mancini\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal, and while his replacement, Manuel Pellegrini, restored order by winning the title and the Capital One Cup last season, he is now experiencing similar problems.</p> <p>Not many people would have predicted that Manchester United would be the more stable side going into Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s derby a few weeks ago, but City continue to find new ways to make problems for themselves and the heat is on after last Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s defeat at West Ham was followed by Newcastle United loosening their grip on the Capital One Cup on Wednesday night.</p>           Manuel Pellegrini worried after Manchester City lose 2-0 to Newcastle United \xe2\x80\x93 video    <p>Pellegrini is less volatile than Mancini but like his predecessor, the inertia of his players must be driving him up the wall. At their best, the champions are the most fearsome side in the country and have more ways of punishing opponents than Chelsea. Their attack is more varied, it is not beyond them to match Chelsea for physicality in midfield and they have tremendous strength in depth. When David Silva finds pockets of space between the lines, Yaya Tour\xc3\xa9 is in the mood to stomp through the middle and Sergio Ag\xc3\xbcero is tormenting defences, City can be unstoppable.</p> <p>What they do not have is the focus and steel that Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho has gradually been instilling at Chelsea. Whereas Chelsea look ominously tough, unbending and ruthless, City\xe2\x80\x99s half-baked performances are suggesting that they do not have the hunger or desire either to mount a proper title defence or to match the intensity of a Mourinho side on the charge.</p> <p>Whatever the structural problems, a squad of City\xe2\x80\x99s quality ought to have managed more than six wins in their first 15 matches in all competitions. They should not be meekly standing by to allow Chelsea through.</p> <p>That record is a damning indictment of the squad\xe2\x80\x99s lax attitude and while it is premature to talk of a crisis, the coming week already seems like a defining period in City\xe2\x80\x99s season. City will see Chelsea disappear over the horizon if there are more dropped points when they welcome United, and their hopes of qualifying from their Champions League group will be hanging by a thread if they fail to beat CSKA Moscow at home next Wednesday.</p> <p>It does not help that Silva, the man who makes City tick, is a doubt with the knee injury that forced him off during the 2-0 defeat by Newcastle. Tour\xc3\xa9 is also nursing a groin problem.</p> <p>The worry for City is that they were not unfortunate against West Ham or Newcastle, rather they were outworked and outplayed by opponents who identified that the weakness in Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s side lies on the left side of their defence. West Ham\xe2\x80\x99s opener came after Enner Valencia burst past Eliaquim Mangala and set up Morgan Amalfitano, while Rolando Aarons gave Newcastle the lead after eluding the French centre-back. Mangala has been erratic since his \xc2\xa332m move from Porto but he clearly needs more cover and he is not the only City player who is out of sorts. In midfield, Tour\xc3\xa9 has been off-colour and Fernandinho, who was caught dawdling on the ball in the build-up to Aarons\xe2\x80\x99s goal, has not been the same player since Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s 7-1 defeat against Germany at the World Cup.</p> <p>Yet Pellegrini, who has been criticised for being too wedded to the 4-4-2 system that has left City exposed in the Champions League, seems unwilling to adapt to the opposition. In a way it is admirable that he believes his team are strong enough in attack to deal with any setbacks at the other end but City are too open. They have only kept three clean sheets and have rarely looked assured when defending.</p> <p>Plenty of time remains for them to rescue their ailing season but they are in danger of chucking it away at the moment and that would be a terrible waste of talent. In fact, it would be unforgivable. The tragicomedy was amusing in the past but this time the joke is wearing thin.</p>    '
