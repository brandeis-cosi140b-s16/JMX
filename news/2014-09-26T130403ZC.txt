Paul Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s squad had been affected by a virus before that first loss of the season and his players will arrive recovered, though competing with Chelsea, with Diego Costa fit and starting, will provide its own problems. The leaders have lost one league game at home to Villa in 12 years. They will be confident of remaining clear of the pack.
