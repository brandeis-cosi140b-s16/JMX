b'ANOTHER BOUT OF NASTY LEEDS-KNACK <p>Having had no problem with upstanding citizens such as Cuddly Ken Bates and the good people in charge of Bahraini wealth managers Gulf Finance House being deemed fit and proper enough to own Nasty Leeds, the Football League today announced that tax-avoiding Massimo Cellino was not fit to own the club and asked him to step down after receiving evidence from an Italian court that diagnosed his tax-knack.</p> <p>Fiver readers wondering if that can possibly be the same Football League that is headed by Shaun Harvey, who once told a parliamentary select committee he didn\xe2\x80\x99t know who owned Nasty Leeds despite being the club\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive, may be perturbed to know that it is indeed. But they can also take solace from the fact that Shaun neither took part in last week\xe2\x80\x99s debate nor the subsequent vote after admitting a conflict of interest in this particular case. Which was good of him.</p> <p>In Harvey\xe2\x80\x99s absence, various Football League suits arrived at the conclusion that Cellino is unfit to own an English football club on the back of evidence from an Italian court on the manner in which he avoided paying import duty on a yacht to which he\xe2\x80\x99d treated himself, stating that he is \xe2\x80\x9csubject to a disqualifying condition under the terms of the Test\xe2\x80\x9d. All of which high-handed moralising might be fair enough if so many other rogues, vagabonds and ne\xe2\x80\x99er-do-wells hadn\xe2\x80\x99t previously passed their \xe2\x80\x9cTest\xe2\x80\x9d with the precision and metronomic regularity of Xabi Alonso before that howler against Manchester City last week.</p> <p>For all his faults, Cellino has actually been a stabilising influence on Nasty Leeds compared to recent owners, investing no end of dosh and getting them back on the kind of even keel that would be the envy of any luxury yacht skipper about to have his vessel seized because he owes the taxman \xe2\x82\xac388,500. The Football League, which lets not forget is headed by a man who steered Bradford City into administration and was Cuddly Ken\xe2\x80\x99s right-hand man when Nasty Leeds almost followed them, claims to be attempting to drum people such as Cellino out of English football for the good of English football, but it is difficult to see how their latest decision can have anything but an adverse affect on Nasty Leeds.</p> <p>On the flip side for the club, Cellino has a fortnight to appeal and even if unsuccessful, in a state of affairs that renders the Football League\xe2\x80\x99s decision rather ludicrous, will be deemed fit, under UK law, to own the club again in March. \xe2\x80\x9cThe steps that the League wishes the club to take \xe2\x80\x93 to remove Mr Cellino only to re-appoint him in three months\xe2\x80\x99 time - will be destabilising for the club, its supporters and sponsors and cannot be in the best interests of any party,\xe2\x80\x9d harrumphed a statement on the Nasty Leeds website today. In the meantime, it seems a cunning interim plan has been hatched, with the presence of pint-sized Austin Powers co-star Verne Troyer at Nasty Leeds\xe2\x80\x99s win over Derby on Saturday suggesting that the Italian has hired a temporary replacement for himself in the form of Mini-mo.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY     Brendan Rodgers stretches \xe2\x80\x98arguably\xe2\x80\x99 to the absolute limit.

First, I read the Fiver (late) and laughed. Second, Roberto Soldado scored. For a second, I thought some cataclysm was upon us, maybe the apocalypse. Then I remembered that even a broken watch is right twice a day, and stopped panicking. I look forward to another funny Fiver in April, and Soldado notching against Southampton at St Marys\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Craig Fawcett.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cChelsea have dropped points? Against Sunderland? In these times of knee-jerk reaction, surely that counts as a crisis? Cancel the Christmas party, Jos\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Darren Leathley.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cEither James Tong (Friday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver letters) is also masquerading as a Newcastle United fan with a nickname of Guellzy, or he should stop copying letters already published elsewhere. In this case from Football 365\xe2\x80\x99s mailbox on the very same day. I\xe2\x80\x99m particularly impressed with his dedication to amending the first paragraph, but then he lets himself down by leaving the second paragraph unaltered\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Phil Kayes (not a pseudonym, or a NUFC fan).</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI assume that your regret that Mr Vincent Kompany wasn\xe2\x80\x99t given the No2 shirt was a reference to \xe2\x80\x98two\xe2\x80\x99s company\xe2\x80\x99 - rather than to a toilet-related implication linked to the fact that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t played to quite his usual high standards this season?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 James Smart.</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
