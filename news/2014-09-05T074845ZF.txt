b'Football transfer rumours: Juventus to bid for Juan Mata?'


b'<p>Think of the Rumour Mill, and transfers in general really, as a Newton\xe2\x80\x99s cradle. Or one of those gold waving cat things (interesting fact to use at your next society cocktail party: due to the differences in the interpretation of gestures and body language between the West and Japan, those cats aren\xe2\x80\x99t actually waving goodbye/hello, but beckoning. You\xe2\x80\x99ll be the hit of the soiree). Or Russell Kane. Sure, you might find it annoying, distracting and vaguely unnecessary, but the one thing you have to admit is that it keeps going. Keeps on churning. Keeps on going. Keeps on keepin\xe2\x80\x99 on.</p> <p>And it will never, ever stop. You can put your fingers in your ears and cover your eyes as much as you like, but it simply will not cease. So you might as well embrace it, really.</p> <p>Just as Manchester United fans are no doubt embracing this new-found liking for chucking cash around willy, and indeed nilly. Finally, after years of mending and making do as fifties incontinently gushed out of the club and to some loan shark in a sharp suit or the Glazers\xe2\x80\x99 piggy bank, some of this dough is going on the stuff it\xe2\x80\x99s meant to go on \xe2\x80\x93 specifically, players. And lots of them. Shiny ones, too.</p> <p>After the acquisitions of Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao, it seems Ed Woodward is taking a further break from swapping family photos with Jorge Mendes to throw a sack of green at Roma, in the hope that Kevin Strootman will be thrown right back. Or, perhaps given the current state of the Dutchman\xe2\x80\x99s knee, carefully packed with hay, bubble wrap and some of that utterly hateful squeaky polystyrene stuff and very carefully shipped over to Manchester.</p> <p>Louis van Gaal wants a handsome goateed centre-back too, but as his mother should really have taught him, I want doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get, and he will be disappointed in his pursuit of Mats Hummels, with Borussia Dortmund not keen to let their star defender go, even though United were awfully kind and made Jurgen Klopp do that massive and slightly unsettling grin by giving them Shinji Kagawa back.</p> <p>Heading out the Old Trafford door in January could well be Juan Mata, seemingly marginalised by all these expensive new boys, even though he was one of those expensive new boys only eight short months ago. Those in the know reckon Juventus are counting out the pennies in preparation for a bid for the man who rather unsettlingly resembles a better-looking Wayne Rooney, and if Mata is sold he will presumably take the news in that crushingly pleasant and polite manner that will make you feel bad for occasionally saying \xe2\x80\x98Is he actually that good, though?\xe2\x80\x99</p> <p>Despite Arsenal apparently being in the wad-waving, pocket-jingling, light-a-cigar-with-a-fifty, \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ve-got-oodles-of-cash-to-fire-around-from-a-t-shirt-cannon\xe2\x80\x99 club too these days, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t manage to sign a centre-back in the transfer window, meaning they are basically one injury away from Gunnersaurus or one of those waving/not waving cats having to fill in at centre-half. Rather selfishly Arsene Wenger is keen to avoid such an undeniably entertaining situation, so he\xe2\x80\x99s going to improvise in another, perhaps slightly more traditional manner by signing Mario Yepes, currently a free agent after leaving Atalanta, so thus not restricted by the iron fist of the FIFA registration rules.</p> <p>Yepes is 38-years-old (39 in January) and missed a decent chunk of last season with injury, so you are very welcome to fill in your own punchline about that one here. Quite apart from anything else, by the time Arsenal have got Yepes up out of his big chair in the corner, oiled up his joints that presumably sound like the walls in the Death Star trash compactor these days and he\xe2\x80\x99s recovered from the \xe2\x80\x98three to four week\xe2\x80\x99 injury suffered in his first training session that keeps him out for two months, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be January and the next transfer window anyway, so there\xe2\x80\x99s a reasonable chance this one might be a mild waste of time. Hey ho.</p> <p>Speaking of free agents with questionable limbs, Liverpool are apparently all set to sign Victor Valdes, once the Spanish keeper\xe2\x80\x99s banjaxed knee is un-banjaxed enough to complete a medical. However, apparently Liverpool will have to put on their best suit of clothes, slick down their hair and say pretty please with sugar on top to the Premier League if they actually want Valdes to play before January, because they will require special permission to add him to their 25-man squad. As that currently only contains 19 players, it would therefore presumably take an act of quite hilarious spiteful officiousness for the suits so say \xe2\x80\x98Naaaaah\xe2\x80\x99 to that one.</p> <p>At the other end of the age scale, Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United have supposedly been ALERTED by the news that Zakaria Bakkali, a red hot young munchkin of a winger who is currently setting hearts a flutter at PSV, has rejected a new contract at the Dutch club, and with his current one set to expire next summer, they are understandably keen to get some sort of compensation for the 18-year-old. Atletico Madrid and Borussia Dortmund are mad keen too, it says here.</p> <p>In further football child news, Liverpool are sniffing around Martin Odegaard, a precocious 15-year-old that the Rumour Mill probably would have immaturely hated at school just because he\xe2\x80\x99s dead good at stuff and probably all the girls fancy him. Manchester United were linked with him in the transfer window, so one suspects Brendan Rodgers is at least partly motivated by the prospect of a delicious gazumping, as much as actually rating and wanting the player.</p> <p>We\xe2\x80\x99ll leave the final word to Nikola Zigic, who provided us with some light relief as the summer transfer window built to a head-mashing crescendo by being linked with Arsenal. Of course they eventually elected to sign Danny Welbeck, presumably on the basis that he\xe2\x80\x99s better at football than the spindly Serb, and Arsene Wenger pooh-poohed the rumours, but the man himself insists it was all legit:</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy agent was talking with Arsenal but they finally opted for another player,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe talked with them until the last days of the market. I am very happy because Arsenal had me on their list. I would have liked to join them, but big teams always consider several alternatives.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>And that should probably do it, no more business to attend to h...oh, wait a second. Celtic have signed John Guidetti on loan from Manchester City, four days after the transfer window closed and they thought a paperwork snafu had crushed their dreams. Huh. Bloody love a loophole Celtic, don\xe2\x80\x99t they?</p>'
