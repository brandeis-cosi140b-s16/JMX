b'Joe Hart: Manchester City have team spirit to put things right next season'


b'<p>Joe Hart insists the present Manchester City squad is able to put things right, with the goalkeeper convinced they can create more history for the club next season.</p> <p>City have fallen from joint-top with Chelsea on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day to fourth place, though Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s convincing 2-0 win over West Ham United arrested this slump and ended a sequence of two consecutive league defeats.</p> <p>Despite Manuel Pellegrini\xe2\x80\x99s players drawing criticism that they are an ageing group who have become stale and that some need to be moved out, Hart is clear they have much to offer. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got the squad to put it right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the 28-year-old, who accepts City have underperformed this term.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve let ourselves down at key moments. It\xe2\x80\x99s a difficult league to win. The two times we\xe2\x80\x99ve won it it\xe2\x80\x99s gone right to the wire. This season a lot of games we\xe2\x80\x99ve played well but teams have tended to raise their game against us. It\xe2\x80\x99s just how it is; that\xe2\x80\x99s not me moaning. That\xe2\x80\x99s this league for you \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s tough. We accept that.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Since 2011 City have won two titles, the FA Cup and League Cup. Hart is clear more trophies can be claimed. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is so much more we can achieve,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve only just started. City has an amazing history and great people. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot more history to create. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been up and down the leagues [as a club]; now we are winning league titles and pushing for them.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been together a long time now. A couple of years ago [under Roberto Mancini] we were fairly new but we had a difficult season and came away with nothing. We have grown together as a group, there is a good line of communication between manager, players and staff. We feel like we can get through whatever gets thrown at us.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>The poor campaign has not affected team spirit, according to the England goalkeeper. \xe2\x80\x9cWe feel quite safe in the dressing room that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got each others\xe2\x80\x99 backs,\xe2\x80\x9d Hart said. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone has bad games \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99ve had plenty. We are not little kids.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s well documented, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got an experienced squad and we\xe2\x80\x99ve got people who have been through a lot of ups and downs. The good thing with this team is that it\xe2\x80\x99s not down to lack of effort or desire. Sometimes you have bad games \xe2\x80\x93that\xe2\x80\x99s football. Sometimes people need a gee up, some people need to be criticised. We\xe2\x80\x99ve been together a long time now and we make sure we know how to get the best out of each other.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to take what you can \xe2\x80\x93 finish as high as possible. We have to win the rest of the games. That\xe2\x80\x99s our only goal now. Whatever people want to make of the season can be done at the end of May and in June. We need to make sure in August we are in a position where we got something out of the season. We have to win games.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>'
