b'<p>Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s progress into the knockout phase proved serene to the last. Sporting Lisbon were outclassed here, and consigned to the Europa League in the process, by a rejigged lineup who flourished in a tie devoid of tension. Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho had not been disconcerted by that first loss of the campaign at Newcastle United last Saturday. His fringe players clearly shared his confidence.</p> <p>This was a stroll from the opening exchanges, against opponents who appeared nervy and gripped by self-doubt from the moment they slipped behind. The only local disappointment stemmed from the fact the teenage debutant, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, was granted a relatively meagre seven minutes on the pitch. This had felt an apt opportunity to blood him for longer even if the flurry of fine touches mustered during his cameo confirmed underlying quality. The midfielder\xe2\x80\x99s chance will surely come again.</p> <p>His presence, coupled with impressive displays from those who have been champing at the bit on the sidelines, offered a reminder of the depth of quality at Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s disposal. This squad can aspire to compete on domestic and European fronts, and they will not be daunted by the identity of their last-16 opponents, to be drawn on Monday. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there are a few sharks in the ocean,\xe2\x80\x9d the manager said. His subsequent admission that he had, albeit reluctantly, himself swum with sharks while on holiday in French Polynesia rather confused the metaphor, but there was still a public wariness ahead of Monday\xe2\x80\x99s draw.</p> <p>The worst case scenario would appear to be Juventus or Paris Saint-Germain \xe2\x80\x93 the alternatives are Shakhtar Donetsk, Basel and Bayer Leverkusen \xe2\x80\x93 yet Chelsea have lost at all five in recent years. \xe2\x80\x9cParis would be good as it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to travel for us and the fans,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery one is hard. You think Basel is easy? We lost twice to them last year and they beat Liverpool. Two or three years ago they beat Manchester United. Leverkusen are a German team. Shakhtar \xe2\x80\xa6 I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there are easy teams at this moment.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t think any of the big teams \xe2\x80\x93 I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about big clubs, but \xe2\x80\x98big teams\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 are out of the Champions League now. Maybe Liverpool. But all the teams that want to win the competition are all still in it. The real Champions League starts now: Barcelona, Real Madrid, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Dortmund, Chelsea, Manchester City, Paris \xe2\x80\xa6 it starts now. Last season we were not one of the top four, for sure, and we played in the semi-finals. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see what we can do this season, step by step.\xe2\x80\x9d There was also some satisfaction to be had in the knowledge City and Arsenal, \xe2\x80\x9cdirect opponents in the Premier League\xe2\x80\x9d, will also have the distraction of continental competition in the new year.</p> <p>Life will become trickier from now on. Whereas the Portuguese club boasted the clearer incentive \xe2\x80\x93 avoid defeat and they would have ensured progress at Schalke\xe2\x80\x99s expense \xe2\x80\x93 it was Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s also-rans who made their mark. Mohamed Salah, on his first start outside the Capital One Cup since the final day of last season, darted up and down the left flank to discomfort the visiting right-back, Ricardo Esgaio. Filipe Lu\xc3\xads was upended by the same defender just inside the area seven minutes in for Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas to open the scoring from the spot, while Andr\xc3\xa9 Sch\xc3\xbcrrle, a World Cup winner turned forgotten man, skimmed a fine second on the turn from the edge of the area as Maur\xc3\xadcio laboured to close him down.</p> <p>The German needed that reward and might have added a second had Rui Patr\xc3\xadcio not pushed away his deflected volley. As it was, the hosts\xe2\x80\x99 third was provided by F\xc3\xa0bregas\xe2\x80\x99s inswinging free-kick and Gary Cahill\xe2\x80\x99s flick, which was prodded into the net by Mikel John Obi from virtually on the goalline. The Nigerian had never previously scored in 55 appearances in this competition, though no other side in this year\xe2\x80\x99s group phase can match the London club\xe2\x80\x99s tally of 17 goals. Diego Costa missed out but still worked feverishly and will be sharper for the experience. \xe2\x80\x9cHis confidence is not high, his condition is not the best,\xe2\x80\x9d Mourinho said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut this was very important for him.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Even defensively, the stand-ins made an impression. Kurt Zouma was aggressive and eager alongside Cahill, while Petr Cech twice denied Islam Slimani from close range when his centre-backs were bypassed. Andr\xc3\xa9 Carrillo alone of the visiting number proved pesky, and it was his cross \xe2\x80\x93 half-cleared by Sch\xc3\xbcrrle \xe2\x80\x93 that provided Jonathan Silva with their consolation. Thereafter the main attraction was Loftus-Cheek\xe2\x80\x99s impressive involvement. \xe2\x80\x9cI said to him: \xe2\x80\x98I gave you this, you have to give me a nice bottle of red wine,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d added Mourinho. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said immediately: \xe2\x80\x98No problem.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Everything about the midfielder suggests he belongs.</p>'
