b'Burnley v Arsenal: match preview'


b'<p>A win for Arsenal would take them to within touching distance of the leaders, Chelsea, if only momentarily, before Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho\xe2\x80\x99s side play QPR on Sunday. The visitors are in search of their eighth successive victory in all competitions, while Burnley have just one win from their past 10 games. Arsenal have not lost to a team in the bottom half this season but Sean Dyche\xe2\x80\x99s side have already beaten one of the top four at Turf Moor, defeating the champions, Manchester City, 1-0 last month.
