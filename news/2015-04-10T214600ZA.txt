b'<p>The Bath accent sounds out of place on an Austria Under-20 international but, then again, there is little about Ashley Barnes that does conform to expectation. He is the Premier League striker who drives a Smartcar to work, who combined non-league football with sixth form studies only eight years ago and whose CV reads like a south of England travel tour organised by Saga. The journey explains why he appears completely unaffected by Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s relegation fight or an avalanche of personal criticism led by Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho.</p> <p>It is a glorious day at Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s Gawthorpe Hall training ground and so it is decided to conduct the interview outside. Standing on a bridge over the River Calder, the sun beating down, it is easy to understand why Barnes relishes every moment of his top-flight career given the arduous route required to get here. It began at Paulton Rovers and the vital break arrived in 2007 when he signed for Ian Holloway\xe2\x80\x99s Plymouth Argyle, although it took loan spells at Oxford, Salisbury, Eastbourne Borough, Torquay United and Brighton and Hove Albion before his professional career truly took off with the Seagulls.</p> <p>Thirteen years ago Barnes was goalkeeper for Bath Arsenal, a junior football team that he claims swept all before it thanks to Scott Sinclair. On Saturday he confronts the rather more grandiose Arsenal as testimony that not every Premier League striker must be moulded by the academy system.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI see people in the game who don\xe2\x80\x99t realise what they\xe2\x80\x99ve got,\xe2\x80\x9d says the 25-year-old. \xe2\x80\x9cBut for someone who has come from non-league football and schoolboys\xe2\x80\x99 football and who went and played everywhere, because so long as I had a football at my feet I was happy, I appreciate everything that is put in front of me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve come a long way and everything has fallen into place for me luckily enough.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe it would have been different if I\xe2\x80\x99d have come through the youth academy route and not through what most people would see as the harder route. If you\xe2\x80\x99re at an academy you don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything else other than having everything at your feet. Having to work hard to make it, and to stay in football, is tough. I appreciate everything that has happened to me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Well, perhaps not everything. Barnes was widely condemned in February for a challenge on Nemanja Matic that prompted a furious reaction from the Chelsea midfielder and, eventually, from Mourinho. The Serbia international was sent off for shoving Barnes to the ground, missing his team\xe2\x80\x99s Capital One Cup final win as a consequence, while Mourinho detailed the minutes when decisions went against the Premier League leaders during the 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge and labelled Barnes\xe2\x80\x99 tackle as \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>Gary Neville claimed the foul was deliberate while the Chelsea manager invited himself on to Sky\xe2\x80\x99s Goals on Sunday programme the following day to continue the argument. His stance was cooly, carefully undermined by Burnley manager Sean Dyche who pointed out that Mourinho, nor any other member of Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s coaching staff or team \xe2\x80\x93 with the exception of Matic \xe2\x80\x93 reacted to the tackle in real time.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI knew something was coming straight after the game as I was getting a lot of texts from friends saying my name was all over the place,\xe2\x80\x9d recalls Barnes. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it all got out of hand because everything about the Premier League is scrutinised on a worldwide basis. But most people in the ground did not react at the time and none of the other players reacted when the incident occurred.</p>     Ashley Barnes at Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s Gawthorpe Hall training ground. Photograph: Gary Calton    <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe [Matic] screened in front of me as I was trying to pass the ball back to David Jones. My only intention was to pass the ball to Jonesy and he screened in front, which is his job. I did catch him, yes, and I apologised, but at the time I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99d caught him. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do anything wrong. It was a lot harder to take when Jos\xc3\xa9 Mourinho then came out with his lottery numbers and some other stuff. People were then coming out of the woodwork to name thugs and giving me all sorts of names. I found that hilarious.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe next day I was at home when a friend texted to say I should put the TV on because Mourinho had gone on Goals on Sunday. I turned it over and then turned it back when he was trying to criticise me. I found it funny. It is part of football, you are going to get your ups and downs and that was a down.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It is difficult to equate Barnes\xe2\x80\x99 unassuming nature with the player who has committed most fouls in the Premier League this season and the man at the heart of the Matic controversy. But, as he admitted of his rise through football\xe2\x80\x99s pyramid, he has had to be tough to reach the Premier League.</p> <p>Equally, Burnley have had to be resilient to defy pre-season predictions and an 11-game run without a win at the start of the campaign to have a chance of survival with seven matches remaining. Barnes is unrepentant.</p> <p>He adds: \xe2\x80\x9cI could get stuck with a reputation but no one else [apart from Matic] in the stadium blinked an eye-lid that day. Everyone got on with the game. Even Mourinho just stood there at the time. These big teams don\xe2\x80\x99t like what we do, which is get in people\xe2\x80\x99s faces and make it hard for them. We\xe2\x80\x99re not just going to turn up at Chelsea and accept they will win. We are not like that, we go there to fight for every point to stay in this league and will continue to do that.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cChelsea\xe2\x80\x99s form wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the best at the time but everyone thinks they should beat Burnley. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not the case, we do a job, and they are screaming and rolling around on the floor after every challenge, stupid things like that. Then he [Mourinho] picks his lottery numbers after. Would he have brought any of it up had they won? You just have to laugh it off and get on with your football.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Seven of the 10 players who have made over 20 appearances for a rarely changed Burnley team had not played in the Premier League prior to this season, Barnes included. In his background, character and determination to seize the opportunity, the forward fits Dyche\xe2\x80\x99s model for Burnley perfectly.</p> <p>Barnes explains: \xe2\x80\x9cThe manager has given us all the freedom and confidence to go against these teams and express ourselves. Whether it is Arsenal on Saturday or when we play Leicester in a couple of weeks, there will be no difference. The gaffer is a strong believer in keeping us going and not going along with \xe2\x80\x93 how should I put this? \xe2\x80\x93 all the nonsense as he sees it. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t believe you need many breaks as a footballer, especially when you\xe2\x80\x99re young.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe training is tough here but Arsenal is going to be tough so why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t every day be tough when you are preparing for something like that? We have to play every game as though it is our last. I strongly believe, as everyone else does at Burnley, that we are staying up so there are no worries about it. If we can do that it will be a magnificent achievement.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Premier League survival is all that concerns Barnes but another taste of international football is something he would consider in the future. As stated, the striker who currently operates on Burnley\xe2\x80\x99s left wing was born and raised in Bath but has played once for Austria Under-20s having qualified through his grandmother, Johanna.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m still not 100% sure how that came about,\xe2\x80\x9d he says of his call-up. \xe2\x80\x9cI think my agent at the time contacted the Austrian FA to let them know and their coach came to see me in pre-season training with Plymouth. He invited me back to train with the Under-20s and I was then selected for a game against Switzerland. It was a good experience but since then I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been back or had any contact with them. Obviously it would be tough to be selected for England with the number of good players there is, and it is the same with Austria, but if anything came up at a later stage I\xe2\x80\x99d definitely consider it.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>From Paulton to Vienna; in Barnes\xe2\x80\x99 case it somehow makes sense.</p>'
