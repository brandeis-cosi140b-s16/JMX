b'<p>Robbie Savage escaped a driving ban for speeding after his lawyer argued that he would get too much abuse if he had to take public transport.</p> <p>The former Wales midfielder turned TV pundit was rushing home from an Alan Shearer charity function to see his kids when he was clocked at 99mph in his luxury Bentley Mulsanne, a court heard.</p> <p>Savage faced the possibility of a 28-day ban but instead was fined \xc2\xa3600 and given six points on his licence by magistrates in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, after his lawyer likened him to Marmite, reports the Northern Echo.</p> <p>Philip Morris, defending, told the court: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a name I\xe2\x80\x99m sure is familiar to you. He is someone who as a result of his professional playing career in football has metamorphasised into a pundit. He is therefore particularly anxious about his licence.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cSomeone once described him as being like Marmite. You either love him or the opposite. As a consequence, the car provides something of a safe haven when getting from home to work and to charitable functions.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Savage, who did not attend court, admitted speeding on the A1 near Junction 47 for Knaresborough. The court heard he had one previous conviction for a mobile phone offence and already had three points on his licence.</p> <p>Savage hosts his own football show on BT Sport.</p>'
