b'Porto v Basel: Champions League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened'


b'<p>So FC Basel limp out of the Champions League in meek fashion, Walter Samuel\xe2\x80\x99s late red card capping a sorry evening for them. They were out of their depth, but take nothing away from Porto, who played very well indeed. Dark horses? Maybe. They\xe2\x80\x99ll look forward to their quarter-final. Thanks for reading. Night.</p>'
