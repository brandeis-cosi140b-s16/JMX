b'The Fiver: Adel\xe2\x80\x99s not fat and he\xe2\x80\x99s not big-boned | Gregg Bakowski'


b'INDULGING IN PORK PIES <p>The Fiver doesn\xe2\x80\x99t usually do sympathy. But when a man who has built his reputation on being generous in feeding hungry hacks what they want to hear, has a pop at someone deemed lazy, occasionally (very occasionally! \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0Fiver Ed) inspired, but ultimately capable of so much more if only they cared, well, this tea-timely email can\xe2\x80\x99t help but side with that someone.</p> <p>And that someone is Adel Taarabt. You see, when \xe2\x80\x98Arry Redknapp accused the occasional QPR playmaker of being \xe2\x80\x9caround three stone overweight\xe2\x80\x9d after the club\xe2\x80\x99s 3-2 defeat by Liverpool on Sunday, the Fiver\xe2\x80\x99s first thoughts were that Taarabt must be dodging salads, necking Tin and gobbling great handfuls of pies Monday to Friday instead of dodging cones, necking protein shakes and other stuff associated with being a handsomely-paid professional footballer.</p> <p>But then we saw a photo of Taarabt on the training field recently, and we were somewhat surprised. Now don\xe2\x80\x99t get us wrong, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be mistaken for a long-distance runner, but neither was he a ringer for Jabba the Hutt either. So it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to understand why Taarabt had the raging funk on when he went storming into tabloid offices this morning claiming he was a kilo lighter than last season (2.2lbs in old money, reader) before demanding that hacks take a picture of his tensed torso and sticky-out undies.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI am a professional \xe2\x80\x93 this is not about retaliation, this is about protecting my reputation,\xe2\x80\x9d he sniffed, worried that potential future employers may think he\xe2\x80\x99s fat and not just lazy. \xe2\x80\x9cMy job is to create, bring goals to the team. Maybe he expects me to make more tackles. I am not this type of player. I can only get fitness playing in the Premier League. You can train six or seven hours, but you won\xe2\x80\x99t be fit,\xe2\x80\x9d he exhaled, before finally breathing in again.</p> <p>And it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t long until Redknapp started feeding the press again. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only reason he has lost weight is because he has had tonsillitis,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, suggesting Taarabt has miraculously dropped three-stone since Sunday. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the only way we could get any weight off of him,\xe2\x80\x9c he added, making it sound \xe2\x80\x93 rather disturbingly \xe2\x80\x93 like QPR deliberately made the Moroccan ill to get him into shape.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe is the worst professional I have ever come across and I have been his only ally at QPR for the past three years. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t try and I have protected him for too long,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Redknapp, perhaps getting a bit closer to what he means because, as the Fiver knows all too well, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be fat to be lazy. \xe2\x80\x9cEven I could suck my stomach in for a picture and look OK,\xe2\x80\x9d he honked.</p> <p>The Fiver doubts it. Perhaps if anyone is indulging in pork pies, it\xe2\x80\x99s the QPR manager.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>It\xe2\x80\x99s Big Cup time, so follow CSKA Moscow 1-2 Manchester City from an empty stadium in Russia right now then catch up with Chelsea 2-2 Maribor from a less deserted Stamford Bridge later. </p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cHe hadn\xe2\x80\x99t realised just how big United is as a club. Maybe David [Moyes] felt that at such a massive club he had to be sure that all corners were covered in terms of his support system. I felt that network was already there, with plenty of great people already in important slots \xe2\x80\xa6 Chelsea started the current season as favourites for the title, with a squad that also had six players in their 30s. I don\xe2\x80\x99t hear any grumbles about the age of their group. Antiquated was a bizarre description of the structure I left behind at Manchester United. Have you seen our new training ground?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Lord Ferg, in a new chapter of his updated booky wook that could carry the subhead It Wasn\xe2\x80\x99t My Fault, refuses to take a share of the blame for Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s failings.</p> A BIGGER PLUG THAN THE ONE FROM THE BFG\xe2\x80\x99S BATH <p>Big Website has got a new YouTube football channel.

It looked very impressive for the first few minutes, but then crashed spectacularly and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t worked the same since. Not even Roy Keane\xe2\x80\x99s autobiography captures a player\xe2\x80\x99s entire career so viciously and accurately quite so quickly\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Daniel Rice</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: the malfunctioning link in my missive (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver Letters). Thanks Fiver. My \xe2\x80\x98friends\xe2\x80\x99 (as a Fiver reader, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really have any) are used to seeing my punchlines fall flat. Seeing it happen in the correspondence section of a national tea-time email doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Jonathan Foulkes.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you reported that everyone\xe2\x80\x99s favourite Moroccan had failed his gaffer\xe2\x80\x99s pick-up test, I speculated as to whether \xe2\x80\x98Arry Redknapp could pick up all of his other players. Junior Hoillett? Easy. Joey Barton? A bit awkward but probably not beyond the old man. But there is surely no way \xe2\x80\x98Arry could raise Richard Dunne even an inch off the ground. It\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder his back\xe2\x80\x99s giving him trouble. If Louis van Gaal has the same test, that\xe2\x80\x99s bad news for Anderson\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 Maurice Murphy.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cRe: savoury snack-based cures for Athletic Bilbao\xe2\x80\x99s European hangover (yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s Fiver). Having \xe2\x80\x98studied\xe2\x80\x99 in Bilbao and nursed multiple hangovers on a weekly basis at a time when the crisp selection was generally fairly poor, I only hope they are getting better snacks to soak up the txakoli with these days. Salt and vinegar Hula Hoops would definitely have been handy during the 2002 World Cup, as would Lucozade\xe2\x80\x9d - James Connors.</p> <p>Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
