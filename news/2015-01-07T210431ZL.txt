b'Lionel Messi still the focus at Barcelona as club call summer election | Sid Lowe'


b'<p>Luis Enrique was still at Barcelona last night. How long for, no one knows, and there were certainly no guarantees, but if they carry on like this in Catalonia he may well end up the only one left. After a week in which Bar\xc3\xa7a sacked their sporting director, Andoni Zubizarreta, and Carles Puyol left the club, and less than a month since the director general was sacked, the president, Josep Mar\xc3\xada Bartomeu, announced Luis Enrique will continue as the coach. But he also announced the presidential election will be brought forward a year to this summer. In other words, no one\xe2\x80\x99s future is secure \xe2\x80\x93 least of all his own.</p> <p>And what, everyone wanted to know, of Lionel Messi, the man who has stood silently at the heart of the gathering storm over the last few days? It is his departure that concerns them. Many fans want others to leave; Messi leaving frightens them.</p> <p>Late on Wednesday night the player had still not spoken; his manager and his president had, but their words did little to calm the crisis. Only one thing was clear: there will be elections in the summer. They will be a curious affair: Fifa\xe2\x80\x99s one-year ban on Barcelona signing anyone means this will not be about promises of the world\xe2\x80\x99s best players coming to Camp Nou. The question will be reformulated: which candidates can ensure that the world\xe2\x80\x99s best player will not leave Camp Nou?</p> <p>This week Messi followed Chelsea on Instagram, a small, insignificant detail that, in the context of crisis, appeared a significant one. His actions have been interpreted by many as a power play but he is clearly unhappy. It has been coming for a while. Messi is a difficult player to manage and his relationship with the board has been strained for a long time. He publicly described one director as \xe2\x80\x9ca man who knows nothing about football\xe2\x80\x9d. But this time the fault-line lies in the dressing room.</p> <p>The deterioration in the relationship between Luis Enrique and Messi has become a very public issue after the Argentinian was left out of the 1-0 defeat at Real Sociedad on Sunday. Messi, like Neymar and Dani Alves, had returned from his winter break just two days before and two days later than his team-mates \xe2\x80\x93 as agreed by the club, and as he has done in the past. Messi then missed an open training session on Monday, arranged annually for children to attend on the eve of Kings Day, the equivalent of Christmas Day. A club statement later said that he was suffering from gastroenteritis. With unfortunate timing, it came three days after the club captain, Xavi Hern\xc3\xa1ndez, had admitted in an interview that \xe2\x80\x9cgastroenteritis\xe2\x80\x9d is often the public excuse that hides other issues.</p> <p>Reports then emerged that Messi had confronted Luis Enrique on Friday and again on Sunday, that the coach had wanted to take disciplinary action against him, and that they no longer talk. Messi was reported to have effectively issued Barcelona with an ultimatum of his own. The club\xe2\x80\x99s captains were trying to intervene to calm the tension between coach and star player. At last, on Wednesday, the club spoke. First, the coach. Luis Enrique repeatedly refused to \xe2\x80\x9cconfirm or deny\xe2\x80\x9d those reports although he did say at one point \xe2\x80\x9csome of them not true\xe2\x80\x9d, and he certainly did nothing to protect Messi from suggestions that he had argued with the coaching staff or had refused to train. Then, with his final remark, he hinted heavily that Messi had broken from collective principles that he considers fundamental. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not talk about what happens in the dressing room or the training ground; what happens there, stays there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said</p>  <p>, but the questions kept coming. Asked if he talks to Messi, Luis Enrique replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI speak to all of them of, course, some more than others.\xe2\x80\x9d How many individual meetings had he had with Messi? \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many I have had, or not had.\xe2\x80\x9d Asked if he thought Messi wants to stay, he replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not the right person to answer that.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cI do not treat all of my players the same, just as I do not treat all of my children the same,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have negotiated things with the players. On some things I have been permissive and on some I have been demanding. There are some rules that everyone must follow. That is one of my principles.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>  <p> Related: Atl\xc3\xa9tico Madrid 2-0 Real Madrid | Copa del Rey round-of-16 first-leg match report </p>   <p>It is a principle he may yet fall by. Taking on Messi is not an approach likely to ensure longevity at the club. He admitted that the sacking of Zubizarreta had \xe2\x80\x9cweakened\xe2\x80\x9d his position and he did little to assuage fears that his relationship with Messi had broken down; in fact, much of what he said confirmed the avalanche of reports that have talked of confrontation and discontent, of Messi issuing a threat: \xe2\x80\x9cHim or me\xe2\x80\x9d.</p> <p>A few hours later, Bartomeu appeared. He confirmed that Luis Enrique was continuing as manager, denied delivering him an ultimatum and insisted that it was not true that the coach had wanted to begin disciplinary procedures against the No10. He also insisted that Messi is not for sale and has a contract, but here the conviction faltered. He could not and would not state categorically that Messi will stay or even that he was confident that the Argentinian wishes to stay. \xe2\x80\x9cI think he is happy. I don\xe2\x80\x99t say that because I am sitting down having a coffee with him, although we have spoken,\xe2\x80\x9d said the president. \xe2\x80\x9cI say that because you can see it on the pitch, in the way he was playing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>As arguments go it was not the most convincing. Even less so was his explanation for Zubizarreta\xe2\x80\x99s sacking and the promise to send a \xe2\x80\x9chard letter\xe2\x80\x9d to Sepp Blatter and to take on Fifa over the club\xe2\x80\x99s transfer ban.</p> <p>By the end of a 75-minute press conference, the second of an extremely long day in Barcelona after Luis Enrique had spoken earlier, Bartomeu looked exhausted, his voice strained. He has been in the post for less than a year, having replaced Sandro Rosell who resigned amid the scandal of the Neymar signing.</p> <p>He would have liked to hang on longer but the pressure became too much; he is calling elections to \xe2\x80\x9cease the tension surrounding the club\xe2\x80\x9d. He will soon be on his way, too. He did not confirm if he would stand but most expect him to. He is extremely unlikely to win. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think the image of the club is so bad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. But increasingly, Barcelona supporters believe it is and that is why he was forced into a corner and must now call a club election.</p>'
