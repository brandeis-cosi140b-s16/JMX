b'Survival instincts made Tony Pulis obvious choice for West Brom job | Stuart James'


b'<p>When West Bromwich Albion\xe2\x80\x99s board weighed up the merits of appointing Tony Pulis or Tim Sherwood, it ultimately came down to 22 years of managerial experience and the realisation the Welshman represents the nearest thing there is to guaranteed Premier League survival.</p> <p>Any reservations from outside about the style of football West Bromwich Albion may play, or Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s approach to management and how that would work within a continental structure, were given short shrift by the decision-makers at The Hawthorns. West Brom need to stay up and Pulis, with his record of never being relegated, is better equipped than anyone to navigate a path away from the lower reaches of the table and deliver those colossal Premier League revenue streams.</p> <p>Once Alan Irvine was sacked on Monday, after a run of seven defeats in nine matches, West Brom wasted no time in targeting Pulis. Among the club\xe2\x80\x99s hierarchy there was an acceptance they had to act swiftly, not just to arrest the decline on the pitch but also to make sure the man who miraculously transformed Crystal Palace\xe2\x80\x99s fortunes last season \xe2\x80\x93 the Premier League manager of the year no less \xe2\x80\x93 was offered the job before a rival club stepped in.</p> <p>While much has been made of Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s desire to have the final say on transfers, there is a degree of bemusement among senior figures at the club that the issue has become such a talking point. West Brom are adamant each head coach who has gone before Pulis, whether that be Tony Mowbray, Roberto Di Matteo, Roy Hodgson, Steve Clarke, Pepe Mel or Irvine, worked in exactly the same way. Players come and go but never without the head coach\xe2\x80\x99s approval.</p> <p>It is something about which Pulis sought reassurances from Jeremy Peace, West Brom\xe2\x80\x99s chairman, perhaps concerned by Irvine revealing early on he had not seen several of the summer signings play. While Irvine\xe2\x80\x99s admission surprised many, he also accepted that was the way it had to be in the short term \xe2\x80\x93 the Scot had previously been working at academy level, West Brom were left with only 13 outfield players in the summer and the only football to scout at that time was taking place in Brazil.</p> <p>Pulis arrives in a very different set of circumstances and brings with him a wealth of managerial and player knowledge. When it comes to identifying signings, he will work closely with Terry Burton, the technical director. The two have got on well in the past and Burton also knows Dave Kemp, Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s assistant, from their time together at Wimbledon. Pulis will not get every player he asks for but he will not have anyone pushed on to him either. It has been reported that Pulis will make an approach for Peter Crouch, who he signed at Stoke in 2011, during the just opened transfer window.</p> <p>As for the brand of football, it would be fair to say there was a time when West Brom supporters could not have imagined Pulis being in charge of their team. As Matthew Etherington, one of Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s former players at Stoke, reflected on Twitter: \xe2\x80\x9cStrange old game, remember West Brom fans barraging when he [Pulis] was at Stoke: \xe2\x80\x98Hoof ball\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Indeed a match report that appeared in West Brom\xe2\x80\x99s programme in the 2007-08 season was absolutely scathing of Stoke under Pulis. \xe2\x80\x9cStoke train with cannons rescued from local medieval ruins,\xe2\x80\x9d read the article. \xe2\x80\x9cFootballs are loaded into them and fired into the distance for [Mamady] Sidib\xc3\xa9 to head and [Ricardo] Fuller to run after. It\xe2\x80\x99s a game plan that squeezes the life out of what used to be known as football.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>How times, and opinions, change. Pulis\xe2\x80\x99s stock could not be higher after his success at Selhurst Park. Palace were anchored to the foot of the table with four points when he was appointed in late November. By the time the season ended they were 11th \xe2\x80\x93 Palace had finished higher only twice in their history \xe2\x80\x93 after picking up 38 points from 26 games under Pulis.</p> <p>Their tactics were brilliantly executed. Palace averaged only 34.5% possession \xe2\x80\x93 significantly less than anyone else \xe2\x80\x93 and only Cardiff and Norwich, both of whom were relegated, scored fewer goals. But Palace under Pulis were superb defensively (they kept 10 clean sheets in the league \xe2\x80\x93 only Manchester City, Chelsea and Arsenal had more), full of energy and wonderful exponents of the counterattack. Come the end of that campaign Selhurst Park was bouncing. Pulis had galvanised a club, never mind a team.</p> <p>To revive West Brom in the same way Pulis will need some new players, in particular on the flanks, where there is a glaring lack of pace and penetration, and probably up front, depending on whether the former Stoke manager can extract any more from a misfiring strikeforce. Either way, it will be no surprise to see Pulis succeed. As Etherington succinctly put it on Twitter: \xe2\x80\x9cHe will keep them up #getsresults.\xe2\x80\x9d Albion\xe2\x80\x99s board arrived at the same conclusion.</p>'
