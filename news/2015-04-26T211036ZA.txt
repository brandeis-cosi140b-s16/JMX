b'Arsenal <p>David Ospina 5/10</p> <p>A quiet afternoon for the Colombian \xe2\x80\x93 except for the moment when he took out Oscar and should have cost his team a penalty.</p> <p>H\xc3\xa9ctor Beller\xc3\xadn 7/10</p> <p>A confident display from the Spanish full-back. Restricted Eden Hazard\xe2\x80\x99s threat from wide and got forward to support the hosts\xe2\x80\x99 attacking play.</p> <p>Per Mertesacker 6/10</p> <p>Did not have much to do given Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s extremely cautious approach. Should have done better with second-half scoring opportunity.</p> <p>Laurent Koscielny 7/10</p> <p>Also had little to do defensively. Pushed forward and impressed doing so, especially when setting up Santi Cazorla for a shot on goal.</p> <p>Nacho Monreal 7/10</p> <p>The left-back got forward when he could and delivered a couple of teasing crosses during the first half. Competent enough defensively.</p> <p>Francis Coquelin 6/10</p> <p>A solid enough display from the Frenchman, who occasionally could be seen directing his team\xe2\x80\x99s play from deep midfield.</p> <p>Santi Cazorla 7/10</p> <p>Looked to drive forward from centre midfield and linked well with those ahead of him. Should have done better with a second-half chance.</p> <p>Aaron Ramsey 6/10</p> <p>Provided some lovely moments, most notably his first-time control and lay off to Mesut \xc3\x96zil, but generally struggled to impose himself from wide.</p> <p>Mesut \xc3\x96zil 7/10</p> <p>A consistently energetic display from the usually languid forward. Should have done better with a chance right at the death.</p> <p>Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez 6/10</p> <p>Started in typically aggressive and dynamic style from wide left before fading as an attacking threat as the contest went on.</p> <p>Oliver Giroud 5/10</p> <p>French forward started positively but failed overall to make an impact against Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s well\xe2\x80\x91drilled centre-backs, especially John Terry.</p> <p>Substitutes</p> <p>Welbeck (for Coquelin, 76); Walcott (for Giroud, 84)</p> <p>Not used Szczesny, Debuchy, Gibbs, Wilshere, Flamini</p> Chelsea <p>Thibaut Courtois 6/10</p> <p>Alert to \xc3\x96zil\xe2\x80\x99s first\xe2\x80\x91half shot and a deflected effort from Danny Welbeck late on. In between flapped badly when clearing a second-half free-kick.</p> <p>Branislav Ivanovic 7/10</p> <p>Typically aggressive and hard-working show from the right-back. Got forward when possible, also booked for a studs up tackle on Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez.</p> <p>Gary Cahill 7/10</p> <p>Ably supported his captain John Terry at the centre of Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s defence. Rarely flustered. Blocked first-half shot from Cazorla with his arm.</p> <p>John Terry 9/10</p> <p>A brilliant display by the 34-year-old. Cleared and blocked everything that came his way. May wake to find Olivier Giroud still in his back pocket.</p> <p>C\xc3\xa9sar Azpilicueta 8/10</p> <p>A highly impressive performance by the Spaniard. Defended superbly and pressed forward when the opportunity presented itself.</p> <p>Cesc F\xc3\xa0bregas 6/10</p> <p>Received a mixed reception on his return to the Emirates and had a mixed game \xe2\x80\x93 attacked well in spells but was also booked for diving.</p> <p>Nemanja Matic 6/10</p> <p>As ever, sat in front of the Chelsea defence and did what was required to keep the opposition at bay. Did not get forward but did not need to.</p> <p>Ramires 6/10</p> <p>Was positioned on the right of Chelsea\xe2\x80\x99s attack and put in a typically energetic display. Squandered his team\xe2\x80\x99s best chance in the first half.</p> <p>Oscar 6/10</p> <p>Most notable moment as striker in unconventional lineup was being wiped out by David Ospina after clearing bar. Replaced at half-time.</p> <p>Willian 7/10</p> <p>An elusive presence in a central attacking role. Played first-half pass to Ramires that the midfielder should have converted into game\xe2\x80\x99s opening goal.</p> <p>Eden Hazard 5/10</p> <p>Perhaps the Belgian\xe2\x80\x99s quietest display of the season. Bar a threatening pass to Ramires after 21 minutes, did little of note from wide left.</p> <p>Substitutes</p> <p>Drogba (for Oscar, h-t); Zouma (for F\xc3\xa0bregas, 90); Cuadrado (for Willian, 90)</p> <p>Not used Cech, Filipe Lu\xc3\xads, Mikel, Loftus-Cheek</p> <p>Referee</p> <p>Michael Oliver</p>'
