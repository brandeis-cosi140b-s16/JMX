b'Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s Harry Kane gives Roy Hodgson an England reminder at QPR'


b'<p>Mauricio Pochettino had some of his own in the away end at QPR. The Tottenham Hotspur manager\xe2\x80\x99s sons, Sebastiano and Maurizio, together with his older brother, Javier, had eschewed the posh seats to live this Premier League match properly; rubbing shoulders with the die-hards and bellowing out the songs. There was one, in particular, that enjoyed repeated airings.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cYes, they know the Harry Kane song,\xe2\x80\x9d Pochettino said with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cThey had the possibility to go to the directors\xe2\x80\x99 box but they preferred to go with the supporters, to sing the songs.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>It was a special day for Pochettino, one that mixed his twin passions \xe2\x80\x93 family and football, up-tempo, winning football. At full-time, he walked over towards the visitors\xe2\x80\x99 enclosure to get a snap for the family album. \xe2\x80\x9cI went over to take the picture because it was a fantastic moment for my sons and brother, and for me, too,\xe2\x80\x9d Pochettino said.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cMy brother is over from Argentina for a couple of weeks. He was also at the Capital One Cup final. He works on the family farm in Murphy. He enjoys football but I don\xe2\x80\x99t let him give me his opinions. He\xe2\x80\x99s very honest with me, sometimes too much. He\xe2\x80\x99s six years older than me.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Tottenham have long enjoyed popularity in Argentina because of Ossie Ardiles and Ricky Villa but Pochettino and the winger, \xc3\x89rik Lamela, have raised the club\xe2\x80\x99s profile again. All of the team\xe2\x80\x99s matches are televised live and Pochettino said everybody in his hometown of Murphy in the Santa Fe province [population: 3,600] had watched the Capital One Cup final on the Sunday before last, which Tottenham lost 2-0 to Chelsea.</p> <p>Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s fans could enjoy more than Kane\xe2\x80\x99s latest headline-grabbing performance on Saturday. Ryan Mason was outstanding in front of the watching England manager, Roy Hodgson and, if Kane is assured of his first senior call-up later this month against Lithuania and Italy, then his midfield team-mate is also in with a shout.</p> <p>Hodgson has mentioned Mason in several recent interviews \xe2\x80\x93 the 23-year-old is in his thoughts \xe2\x80\x93 and he would have been impressed by his touch, passing and tenacity against Queens Park Rangers. Mason released Kane for the striker\xe2\x80\x99s second goal, having clashed with Karl Henry moments earlier by the touchline and squared up to him. Pochettino stepped in from his technical area to drag Mason away. \xe2\x80\x9cRyan has character, big character,\xe2\x80\x9d Pochettino said.</p> <p>This was a triumph of Tottenham\xe2\x80\x99s collective character. They had Hugo Lloris to thank for a smart stop from Charlie Austin on 20 minutes and the referee, Craig Pawson, for ignoring two strong penalty appeals from QPR. Lloris looked to have caught Mauricio Isla on 39 minutes; Nabil Bentaleb appeared to block Austin\xe2\x80\x99s shot with his hands on 77 minutes.</p> <p>But Tottenham were good in the second-half while they toughed it out in the closing stages, after Sandro\xe2\x80\x99s well-executed finish had sparked a direct and physical assault from the home team.</p> <p>\xe2\x80\x9cThe connection between the team and the supporters is special,\xe2\x80\x9d Pochettino said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe beginning [of the season] was different. Now, it is fantastic. We have a very good mentality. We\xe2\x80\x99ve improved, not only tactically and physically but mentally. The most important thing I got from the team is that they believe in our way.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>Kane said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe played well but we also dug in when we had to. It shows the character of the squad to beat Swansea last Wednesday and QPR after losing at Wembley to Chelsea and going out of the Europa League to Fiorentina.\xe2\x80\x9d He has 26 goals in all competitions this season and only Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have scored more across Europe\xe2\x80\x99s top divisions. It is remarkable to think Kane did not start a league game until 9 November. His burgeoning reputation appears to be preceding him. There were a few moments when QPR players stood off him or hesitated fractionally before looking to challenge.</p> <p>Hodgson could also take heart from Austin\xe2\x80\x99s performance. He rattled the crossbar in the 30th minute while he produced a stunning goalline clearance to deny Christian Eriksen on the hour. QPR\xe2\x80\x99s survival hopes continue to rest heavily on him.</p> <p>Chris Ramsey could lament the fine margins at work, particularly with regard to the penalty claims, but the Premier League has no time for hard luck stories and the QPR manager knows it.</p> <p>The defending on both Kane\xe2\x80\x99s goals was horribly loose.</p> <p>Man of the match Harry Kane (Tottenham Hotspur)</p>'
