b'The Fiver | As if he is on a one-man campaign to infantilise society'


b'#R#I#O <p>You might have noticed that Rio Ferdinand is a vocal presence on Twitter and has a huge following on the popular social networking site. And you could be forgiven for thinking that is the most insignificant thing you will read today. But you would be wrong. You would be wrong. Because, somewhere, some faceless, godforsaken, hellbound marketing goon \xe2\x80\x93 no doubt in possession of a hipster beard, lens-less glasses and limitless knowledge of craft beer \xe2\x80\x93 has also noticed that Rio Ferdinand is a vocal presence on Twitter and that he has a huge following on the popular social networking site, which must be the only way to explain why the title of the QPR defender\xe2\x80\x99s new book is a hashtag. That\xe2\x80\x99s right. A hashtag. The title of a book is a hashtag, thus forcing people to publicise it unwittingly on social media, and satire is dead, slain by the pen of Rio.</p> <p>The man who brought us merking, an owl delivering rings at a wedding, brilliant films and always making sure to wear a self-branded baseball cap when in public, now offers us a hashtag on the cover of his book, as if he\xe2\x80\x99s on a one-man campaign to infantilise society. The only surprise, of course, is that the book is called #2sides and not #2sidez or #5 or #5sidez or #5waystoimproveyourbantz or #5waystoenjoyfriendlybanterwithoutcausingneedlessoffence.</p> <p>The Fiver gets it, though \xe2\x80\x93 see, there are #2sidestoeverystory and this #side is Ferdinand\xe2\x80\x99s #side. And to give him some due, there do appear to be some interesting t1tbits in the book. For instance, Ferdinand takes aim at Plain Old John Terry over the incident in which the Chelsea captain was accused of racially abusing his brother, Anton. \xe2\x80\x9cFor me the biggest idiot will always be John Terry,\xe2\x80\x9d Ferdinand wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cAs England captain and my centre-back partner he could have saved everyone a lot of pain by admitting immediately he used the word in the heat of the moment, but was no racist. I think that\xe2\x80\x99s probably what happened and what the truth is. Anton and I would\xe2\x80\x99ve accepted that \xe2\x80\x93 instead he never gave us a chance. That was the betrayal. He tried to run away from what he had done.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>But the main headlines this morning were generated by Ferdinand lifting the lid on the David Moyes reign at Old Trafford and revealing that he might just have been a bit too negative to succeed as Manchester United\xe2\x80\x99s manager. Plus he took away the players\xe2\x80\x99 low-fat chips, the evil wretch, and then decided to drop the 35-year-old Ferdinand for big games because he\xe2\x80\x99s not as good as he once was, the monster. \xe2\x80\x9cUnintentionally, he created a negative vibe where, with [Ferg], it had always been positive,\xe2\x80\x9d Ferdinand said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was always how to stop the other side. Moyes set us up not to lose. We\xe2\x80\x99d been accustomed to playing to win.\xe2\x80\x9d</p> <p>All that criticism and not a word of thanks from Ferdinand to Moyes for using last season as a way of preparing him for life at QPR. Some people are so ungrateful. The Fiver looks forward to Moyes\xe2\x80\x99 #sideofthestory.</p> LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE TONIGHT <p>Join Jacob Steinberg from 8pm BST for MBM coverage of Hull City 1-1 West Ham.</p> QUOTE OF THE DAY <p>\xe2\x80\x9cLast weekend it was international break and I went and picked a couple of eggs up from the chicken and was walking across in my wellingtons at half-past six in the morning.
