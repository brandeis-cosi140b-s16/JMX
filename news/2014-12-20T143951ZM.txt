b'Manchester City v Crystal Palace: Premier League \xe2\x80\x93 as it happened!'


b'<p>As expected, City come away with all three points. Palace put in a spirited first-half performance but they were completely blown away in the second half by Silva and co. They will be furious about the disallowed goal and well they should as it was one of the worst decisions in quite some time and would have given them a glimmer of hope of getting something from the game. Thanks for all your emails and tweets and enjoy the rest of your weekend. Bye!</p>     Manchester City\xe2\x80\x99s Joe Hart looks happy that City have got another 3 points in the bag and keep up the pressure on Chelsea. Photograph: Phil Noble/Reuters  '
