b'Arsenal 2-1 QPR - as it happened'


b'<p>And that\xe2\x80\x99s yer lot, for this Boxing Day at least. If Arsenal had only started this game with a one-man handicap, it would have been an absolute thriller. As it was they got there in the end, and the last 20 minutes were very exciting. Still, it\xe2\x80\x99s something. Before that Arsenal were outclassing their opponents, with Alexis S\xc3\xa1nchez brilliant once again at pretty much everything except penalty-taking. Then Giroud sent himself off, the referee gave QPR a soft penalty, and suddenly there was everything to play for and the visitors doing most of the playing for it. Arsenal deserved to win, but QPR showed enough to suggest they won\xe2\x80\x99t lose every away game this season (their next, promisingly, is at Burnley). Cheers for everything. Bye!</p>'
